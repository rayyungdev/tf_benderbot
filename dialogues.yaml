    dialogue: Uh...
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Is it about my eye?

    dialogue: I'm an alien, alright? Now let's drop the subject.

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: My God, a million years!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Y'know, I guess it should be but actually I'm glad. I had nothing to
      live for in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning
      to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, at least here you'll be treated with dignity. Now strip naked
      and get on the probulator.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Interesting. Your DNA test shows one living relative. He's your great

    dialogue: Y'know, I'm the luckiest guy in the whole future. I've been given a
      second chance and this time I'm not going to be a total loser.  What's that?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Your permanent career assignment.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Delivery boy? No! Not again! Please! Anything else!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Take your hands off me! You've been assigned the job you're best at
      just like everyone else.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What if I refuse?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Then you'll be fired...
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Fine!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: '...out of a cannon into the Sun!'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But I don't like being a delivery boy.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well that's tough! Lots of people don't like their jobs but we do them
      anyway. You gotta do what you gotta do! Now hold out your hand, I'm gonna implant
      your career chip. It'll permanently label you as a delivery boy.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Keep that thing away from me!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hold still, damnit. I don't have good depth perception!  You've got
      until the count of five to let me out of here. One...
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: See you in a thousand years!  You owe me one.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Whoa!

    dialogue: Hey! A phone booth! I can call my nephew. Wow, a real live robot! Or
      is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
  - character: ROBOT
    dialogue: Bite my shiny metal ass.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It doesn't look so shiny to me.
  - character: ROBOT
    dialogue: Shinier than yours, meatbag!
  - character: ROBOT
    dialogue: Listen, buddy, I'm in a hurry here. Let's try for a twofer!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, I'd like to place a collect call.
  - character: ROBOT
    dialogue: Great choice!  Bring it on, baby!
  - character: ROBOT
    dialogue: C'mon, c'mon! Kill me already! By the way, my name's Bender!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Help! What's happening?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Lousy stinking rip-off!  Well I didn't have anything else planned for
      today. Let's go get drunk!

    dialogue: '...two, three -- Hey!'
  - character: TERRY
    dialogue: (dramatically) Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Shut up, Terry.
  - character: IPGEE
    dialogue: This is unacceptable, Leela. You must find this Mr. Fry and install
      his chip.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look, he's just a nobody who doesn't want to be a delivery boy. I'd
      really rather not force it on him.
  - character: IPGEE
    dialogue: Well that's your job, whether you like it or not and it's my job to
      make you do your job whether I like it or not - which I do - very much! Now
      get to work!  Life is good!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Why would a robot need to drink?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I don't need to drink, I can quit anytime I want!  So they made you
      a delivery boy, huh? Man, that's as bad as my job.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Really? What do you do Bender?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You any good at it?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'You kidding? I was a star! I could bend a girder to any angle: 30 degrees,
      32 degrees, you name it! (unsure) 31. (normal) But I couldn''t go on living
      once I found out what the girders were for.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Suicide booths!  Well, Fry, it was a pleasure meeting you, I'm gonna
      go kill myself.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait! You're the only friend I have!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You really want a robot for a friend?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, ever since I was six.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, OK. But I don't want people thinking we're robo-sexuals, so if
      anyone asks, you're my debugger.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, no, it's the Cyclops!  Don't look! Don't look!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm not looking!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This is officer 1B-DI requesting back-up.

    dialogue: Welcome to the Head Museum. I'm Leonard Nimoy.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Spock? Hey! Do the thing!
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: I don't do that anymore.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This is unbelievable! What do you heads do all day?
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: We share our wisdom with those who seek it. It's a life of quiet dignity.
  - character: WOMAN
    dialogue: Feeding time!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hmm.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm sorry, Fry, but I have to install your career chip.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, well, if you're sorry why are you doing it?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's my job. You gotta do what you gotta do!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Watch it!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: That's it! You just made my list!

  - character: SMITTY
    dialogue: Keep your big nose out of this, eyeball!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No-one makes fun of my nose.
  - character: URL
    dialogue: Damn!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You guys were totally out of control.

    dialogue: 'Yeah, you know the law: You gotta do what you gotta do.'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, we're trapped!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait a second. You're a bender, right? We can get out of here if you
      just bend the bars.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes.
      What do I look like, a de-bender?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Who cares what you're programmed for. If someone programmed you to jump
      off a bridge would you do it?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'll have to check my program...yep.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Open up!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's
      what separates people and robots from animals...and animal robots.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You're full of crap, Fry!  You make a persuasive argument, Fry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Come on, Bender! You can do it.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Can't...I...can't...do...it!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yes!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You were right, Fry! From now on I'm going to bend what I want, when
      I want, who I want! I'm unstoppable!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't know how you did that.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) No, thanks.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Looks like one of us will have to bend this grate.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Good Lord! What is this?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's the decaying ruins of Old New York. Welcome home, pal!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Its my old neighbourhood. Man, this brings back a lot of memories.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Keep 'em to yourself, pops.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This is where I brought my girlfriend on our very first date.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: My God! She's gone. Everyone I ever knew or cared about is gone.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wait! There's someone you know!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, can't you leave me alone? I'm miserable enough already.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look, I know it's not much consolation but I understand how you feel.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, you don't. I've got no home, no family...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No friends.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: '...My whole world is gone. You can''t possibly understand what it feels
      like to be so alone.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I understand. I'm the only one-eyed alien on this whole planet. My parents
      abandoned me here as a baby and I don't even know what galaxy they were from.
      I know how it feels to be alone.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look, Leela, I don't understand this world but you obviously do, so
      I give up. If you really think I should be a delivery boy, I'll do it.  Your
      chip. What are you doing?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Quitting.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Why?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Because I've always wanted to. I just never realised it before I met
      you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What is the matter with you?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I just wanted to be part of the moment.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey, he stole my ring!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Sorry.  Well, that solves the mystery of the missing ring. This calls
      for a drink.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't wanna spoil the party but we're all job deserters now. We're
      unemployed and we have nowhere to go.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Correction. We're unemployed but we have a doddering old relative to
      mooch off of.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Who are you?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm your dear old Uncle Fry.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I don't have an Uncle Fry.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You do now!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: By God, I am your nephew! This is absolutely incredible!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Can we have some money?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, my, no.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Let me show you around. That's my lab table and this is my work-stool.
      And over there is my intergalactic spaceship! And here's where I keep assorted
      lengths of wire.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Whoa! A real live spaceship!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I designed it myself. Let me show you some of the different lengths
      of wire I used.
  - character: SMITTY
    dialogue: Attention, job deserters! Come out with your hands up. We have you partially
      surrounded.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Get those bums!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, we're boned!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Can't we get away in the ship?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I suppose it is technically possible. Though I am already in my pyjamas.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'll get us out of here.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Can anyone drive stick?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I can. As long as I don't have to parallel park.
  - character: URL
    dialogue: If they try to take off, give 'em an ass-ful of laser.
  - character: LEELA

    dialogue: Two.

    dialogue: One!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Blast-off!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Fire! Fire!
  - character: SMITTY
    dialogue: I can't see nothing. Pretty though!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So I guess without jobs, we'll be fugitives forever.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Not necessarily. Are you three, by any chance, interested in becoming
      my new spaceship crew?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: New crew? W-What happened to the old crew?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Of those poor sons of -- but that's not important. The important thing
      is I need a new crew. Anyone interested?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yes! Yes! That's exactly the job I've always wanted!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thanks for the offer, Professor, but we don't have the proper career
      chips.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, that won't be a problem. As luck would have it I saved the chips
      from my previous crew.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and
      teaching alien women to lurve?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: If by that you mean "transporting cargo" then yes. It's a little home
      business I started to fund my research.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Cool! What's my job gonna be?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You will be responsible for ensuring that the cargo reaches its destination.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So, I'm gonna be a delivery boy?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Exactly!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Alright! I'm a delivery boy!

      Planet Express for reliable, on time delivery.

    dialogue: No, no! That was all just special effects! Now let's have breakfast.
      I hope everyone likes eggs.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm never going to get used to the 31st century.  Caffinated bacon?
      Baconated grapefruit? Admiral Crunch?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, if you don't like that try some Archduke Chocula.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Ah, Hermes! Crew, meet Hermes Conrad. He manages my delivery business,
      pays the bills, notifies next of kin, what have you.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Someone come and dropped this package through the slot last night. Now
      which one of you is the captain?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, my! I haven't picked a new captain yet. It's always so hard to choose.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Hmm, you!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: OK, Captain, this is just a standard legal release protecting Planet
      Express from lawsuits in the event of the unforeseen.

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look, I don't know about any of your previous captains but I intend
      to do as little dying as possible.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Sign the paper!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Now Fry, before you go into space you'll need to see our staff doctor.
      I should warn you though, he's a little unusual. (whispering) He wears sandals!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hi -- eurgh!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Dr. Zoidberg, this is Fry, the new delivery boy. He needs a physical.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Excellent, excellent!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You'll be fine.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Now open your mouth and let's have a look at that brain.  No no no no
      no not that mouth!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I only have one.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Really?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, is there a human doctor around?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Young lady, I'm an expert on humans. Now pick a mouth, open it and say...
      What? My mother was a saint! Get out!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Dear Lord, Bender, you're filthy.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, like you don't have crap in your neck!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Amy, why don't you give his body a going over with the cleaning pick?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: OK. Does it hurt when I go like this?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: A little.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, the doctor says I'm as healthy as a crab. Can I go into space
      now?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: As soon as we finish cleaning Bender. Oh, and Fry, this is our intern,
      Amy Wong. She's an engineering student of mine. (whispering) I like having her
      around because she's the same blood type as me.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hey! You're the unfrozen guy! From the 20th century, right?
  - character: FRY

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hang on. Amy Wong? Of the Mars Wongs?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Look. We're not as rich as everybody says.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh-huh! What sorority do you belong to?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: (ashamed) Kappa Kappa Wong.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, rich girl. Look over here! It's me, Bender. I'm being entertaining.
      (singing) La la la look at my head. It's all painted look at my head! I got
      a big old head, hey! Ho! (talking) Alright, show's over, I'm tired.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Ah, to be young again. And also a robot! Now as I recall you youngsters
      have a package to deliver.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Finally! Come on Bender, let's mosey!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Nice catch, idiot!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So where are we going anyway?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Nowhere special. The moon.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: The moon? The moon moon? Wow! I'm gonna be a famous hero just like Neil
      Armstrong and those other brave guys no one ever heard of!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh, I love stuff like the moon! Can I come, Leela?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well...I guess so. Just be careful. I'd like to hold off any major screwups
      until at least my second day as captain.
  - character: FANSWORTH
    dialogue: Nothing will go wrong.  (whispering) If something goes wrong bring back
      the blood.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Can I do the countdown?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Huh? Oh sure, knock yourself out.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ten......nine --
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK we're here!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hurry up, I wanna see the moon!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Relax, its open till 9.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's one small step for Fry --
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: And one giant line for admission!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow!  Um, can I have cuts?
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: Hmm -- No!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You're not gonna believe this but they landed an amusement park on the
      moon!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Guh! It's the happiest place orbiting Earth.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Lets go, already!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Too much work. Lets burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, if everyone's finished being stupid --
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I had more but you go ahead.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We'll deliver that crate like professionals and then we'll go home.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But I've never been to the moon before.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Alright. We'll deliver that crate like professionals...and then we'll
      go ride the bumper cars.  Amy, why don't you help Fry hoist down the crate.
      Then lock up when you're done. Just be careful.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Aye, aye, Captain! I mean only one eye. I mean, yes, sir, um, ma'am!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Clear?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Clear!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Ready to hoist?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ready!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: My first space delivery.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, greetings, Moon Man, we come in peace. I am Fry from the planet
      Earth.
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: Wise guy, huh? If I wasn't so lazy I'd punch you in the stomach.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But you are lazy, right?
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: Oh, don't get me started.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Better mascots than you have tried.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Who buys this trash?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Idiots who need gifts for other idiots.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, I got you guys refrigerator magnets.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Get it off! Get it off! Get it -- uh oh!  (singing) How many roads must
      a man walk down, before you... (talking) Keep those things off of me! Magnets
      screw up my inhibition unit!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So you flip out and start acting like some crazy folk singer?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes. I guess a robot would have to be crazy to wanna be a folk singer.
  - character: WHALERBOTS
    dialogue: (singing) We're whalers on the moon,
  - character: WHALERBOT
    dialogue: Bender, hey, Bender! Over here!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, jeez, I went to high school with that guy!
  - character: ANNOUNCER
    dialogue: 'Monsanto presents: The Goophy Gopher Revue!'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This is weak!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What's wrong, Fry?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't know. This place is great and all but its just so artificial.
      The gravity, the air, the gophers. You might as well stay on Earth.  That's
      what I came to see! I wanna go out there and jump around like an astronaut.
      Screw this phoney stuff!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But the phoney stuff is what's fun. It's boring out there.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah! You're the kind of guy who visits Jerusalem and doesn't want to
      see the Sexeteria!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Maybe I should take Fry on the Luna Rover ride. You get to wear a space
      suit and drive around on the surface. And the line's short because it's educational.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't care how educational it is. Let's do it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Next year in Jerusalem!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Finally! Get ready for some serious moon action.
  - character: NARRATOR
    dialogue: (voice-over) The story of lunar exploration started with one man. A
      man with a dream.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wow, I never realised the first astronauts were so fat!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian. And he was just using space
      travel as a metaphor for beating his wife.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Wow! I could swear I was really playing virtual skeeball!  Hm?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Look, it's that crate we were gonna throw in the sewer.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: The keys to the ship!  They must have fallen into the crate! Leela's
      gonna kill me!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Nah. She'll probably make me do it.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Mister? Could you please get those keys out for me?
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: What do I look like? A guy who's not lazy?
  - character: NARRATOR
    dialogue: (voice-over) No one knows where, when or how Man first landed on the
      moon...
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I do.
  - character: NARRATOR
    dialogue: '(voice-over) ...but our fungineers think it might have happened something
      like this:'
  - character: WHALERBOTS
    dialogue: (singing) We're whalers on the moon,
  - character: GOPHERS
    dialogue: (singing) We carry a harpoon,
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (singing) ...and sing a whaling tune. We're whalers on the moon...
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's not how it happened.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, really? I don't see you with a fungineering degree! p>
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This is stupid. I'm taking this thing out to the real moon.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, no. This is my first mission and I'm not gonna let us get in any
      trouble. Besides, the car's on a track.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Not for long!
  - character: WHALERBOT
    dialogue: Ooh aah! I died doin' what I loved.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, you're on the surface. Now I'll give you 10 minutes. Then you'll
      get bored, turn around and apologise for being such a jerk. Agreed?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Agreed.  Yee-haw! Woo! Yeah! Crank up the radio!
  - character: WHALERBOTS
    dialogue: We're whalers on the -
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yee-haw!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Time's up. Make a U-turn at the next crater.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No not yet. How 'bout we go look for the original moon landing site?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's crazy! It's been lost for centuries!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well I'm feelin' lucky!  Uh... I'm ready to go back now.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We're gonna die! It's every man for himself!  Help me, Leela!  You did
      it! We're safe!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No. Now we're gonna die.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's every man for himself.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, look what I won from a tourist's pocket!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Shut up. You're distracting me.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'Come on, it''s just like making love. Y''know: Left, down, rotate 62
      degrees, engage rotor.'
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I know how to make love!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Here, let me do it.  Ah, lousy arm. Must be rigged!  That's her, officers!
      Uh, that's the woman who programmed me for evil!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, well, I'm gonna go build my own theme park, with blackjack and
      hookers. In fact, forget the park!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (gasping) I'm sorry, Leela, I can't go on any further. Just leave me
      to die in that barn over there.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thank God!
  - character: FARMER
    dialogue: Trespassers, eh?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, sir. We're amusement park patrons.
  - character: FARMER
    dialogue: Ooh, that's a wicked sinful place. Tilt-a-whirl's OK, but the rest is
      mighty wicked.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Our car broke down and we're out of oxygen. Can we borrow some?
  - character: FARMER
    dialogue: Huh, borry? Looky here, city girl, oxygen don't grow on trees. You'll
      have to earn it doing chores on my hydroponic farm. You can go back to your
      precious theme park at sun up.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I guess we could do chores for a few hours.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, night lasts two weeks on the moon.
  - character: FARMER
    dialogue: Yup. Drops down to -173!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Fahrenheit or Celsius?
  - character: FARMER
    dialogue: "First one, then th'other. And them spacesuits ain't a-heated so you\
      \ ain\x92t goin' nowhere til sunrise. You can sleep in the barn. Just don't\
      \ be a-touchin' my three beautiful robot daughters. Y'hear?"
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Robot daughters?
  - character: FARMER
    dialogue: This here is Lulabelle 7.
  - character: FARMER
    dialogue: Daisy-Mae 128K.
  - character: FARMER
    dialogue: And the Crushinator.
  - character: CRUSHINATOR
    dialogue: (mechanical voice) Yoo-hoo.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Whoa!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I told you to turn around and go back to the park. But oh, no, the park
      was too phoney. We had to see the real moon.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And it was great! We got to see craters and rocks and that one incredible
      rock that looked like a crater and, and these fellas.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, face it. The moon is a dump. It's a boring dried up wasteland.
      And the only reason anybody ever comes here is for the tacky little amusement
      park. Can't you just accept that?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I guess I can't.
  - character: FARMER
    dialogue: I'll learn ye to sleep with my robot daughters!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: He'll never find me in here.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, Bender. You didn't touch the Crushinator, did you?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Of course not. A lady that fine you gotta romance first.
  - character: FARMER
    dialogue: Oh, no you don't! C'mere Crushinator.
  - character: CRUSHINATOR
    dialogue: (mechanical voice) Yes, Pa.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's too low.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hang on. Hang on. Jump.  Hold on to your helmet!
  - character: FARMER
    dialogue: God darn, it Crushinator, jump!
  - character: CRUSHINATOR
    dialogue: (mechanical voice) No, Pa. I love him.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Nightfall's coming.  Hurry, before we freeze.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What do you mean "we", mammal?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, dear! I really ought to do something. But I am already in my pyjamas.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We can't outrun it forever.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Over there! Look! It's the moon landing site! We found it!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Quick, get in.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's footprint!  Hey! My foot's
      bigger! Leela, isn't this the greatest thing you've ever seen?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, look around. It's just a crummy plastic flag and a dead man's tracks
      in the dust.  Now get in here before you freeze.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander,
      with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack.
      Ah, screw the whole thing.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well if the oxygen holds out we might live long enough to starve to
      death.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should have dragged you out here.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's right, you shouldn't have. I still don't get what the big attraction
      is.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up
      at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just didn't have the grades.
      Nor the physical endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending
      a week with me.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: A week would be a little much.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: The moon was like this awesome, romantic, mysterious thing, hanging
      up there in the sky where you could never reach it, no matter how much you wanted
      to. But you're right. Once you're actually here it's just a big dull rock. I
      guess I just wanted you to see it through my eyes, the way I used to.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, look. It really is beautiful. I don't know why I never noticed
      before.
  - character: FARMER
    dialogue: Had to come back for the Crushinator, eh, robot? Well I got you this
      time.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's Amy! We're saved!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Amy? Where'd she learn to operate the controls like that?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Not the magnet! No! No! Nooo --  Uh-oh!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes,
  - character: FARMER
    dialogue: Aww, dang it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) She'll be riding six white horses when she comes,
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So, Fry, was the real moon anything like the moon you used to dream
      about?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, close enough!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,

    dialogue: Hey!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Fry, mon, if you're going to be living in the office you could at least
      be on time for work.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm sorry. I was up really late poking through people's desks.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Alright, people. I will now outline today's 12-point agenda. We'll begin
      with point one then race forward --

    dialogue: 'Concerning our pest problem: Somebody''s been leaving food around and
      it''s attracting owls. And I, for one, am getting tired of cleaning those owl
      traps.  Now......as this shocking graph indicates, our water consumption has
      tripled in the last month. I notice Fry has been here for a month, so I''m appointing
      him head of a committee to find who''s responsible. Fry?  Am I cracking up,
      or is Fry''s living here starting to get in the way of bus -'

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, when you look this good, you don't have to know anything.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Professor, We need to talk to you about Fry.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's right, we want some money -- wait, what's this about Fry?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: He's a nice guy but we think it's about time he got his own place.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, fuff! He's not causing any trouble. Now, if you don't mind, I'm
      rather busy. I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy. This sarcophagus should
      contain the remains of Emperor Nimballa, who ruled Zubin 5 over 29 million years
      ago.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, Professor, great jerky!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: My God, this is an outrage! I was going to eat that mummy! Fry has got
      to go!

      marry me?
  - character: MONIQUE
    dialogue: Oh, Calculon!  It fits! Then you must know that I'm --
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Metric? I've always known. But for you, my darling, I'm willing to convert.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hmm, must be a friend of theirs.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fry, we've got to discuss your living arrangements.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We've all talked it over and --
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, All My Circuits! Move over.  Ahh!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, sometimes in close quarters, people do inconsiderate things without
      realising it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I know but I forgive you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No, Fry, by "close quarters" I mean this office...

    dialogue: Uh-huh.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: '...and by "people" I mean you!'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Right.

    dialogue: And by "inconsiderate" I mean --
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela! We're trying to watch TV.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, would you kindly shut your noise hole?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So, who's that weird-looking guy?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's a human.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's he do?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Eh, the usual human stuff. He laughs, he learns, he loves.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Boring!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: That's what I wanted you to think with your soft, human brain.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, uh, why is the TV getting smaller?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: We'll bill you for the couch.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Cheer up, meatbag, you've barely touched your amoeba.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It looked good but I just don't feel like eating. You want it?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Nah, I'm trying to watch my input. I need plenty of wholesome, nutritious
      alcohol.  The chemical energy keeps my fuel cells charged.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What are the cigars for?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: They make me look cool.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I can't believe they threw me out like that. I must have been really
      acting like a jerk.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, but everybody's a jerk. You, me, this jerk.  That's my philosophy.
      So, where you gonna stay?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't know. Do refrigerators still come in cardboard boxes?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, but the rents are outrageous. Why don't you just come move in
      with me?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Really? That'd be great! You sure I won't be imposing?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Nah, I've always wanted a pet.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Here we are. Your new home.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Cool! Y'know, I've never even seen a robot's apartment before.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Come on in, I'll give you the tour!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Let's see, where to start. OK, this is the TV area, that over there's
      the breakfast nook, and over here is where you'll be living which is great because,
      until now, it's just been wasted space.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's kinda cramped in here. I don't even have room to hang my clothes.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Look, pal, you've only got one set of clothes and you're not taking
      them off while I'm here. Well, I'm bushed. G'night.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait, Bender. Bender?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (sleep-talking) Kill all humans...kill all humans...must kill all the
      humans.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender, wake up!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, listen, Bender, uh, where's your bathroom?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Bath what?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bathroom.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What room?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bathroom!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What what?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ah, never mind!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (sleep-talking) Hey, sexy mama...wanna kill all the humans?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We sure are cheerful this morning.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, this past week with Fry's been a blast! Y'know, beneath this warm,
      sunny exterior, beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What happened to you?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, it's Bender's apartment. He put in carpeting yesterday so now my
      head hits the ceiling. Hey, do you realise you're standing at a weird angle?  Now
      you're OK.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look at yourself. You're a wreck! You've got to find a new place to
      live.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (sexily) Is that an invitation?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Love your optimism, Fry. But seriously, you've got to tell Bender you're
      moving out.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, but he might get kind of upset. I don't think I can do that to
      him.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, there's my little space heater.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, I'm moving out!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What?!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm sorry, Bender, but there's just not enough room.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Not enough room? My place is two cubic metres and we only take up 1.5
      cubic metres. We've got room for a whole nother two-thirds of a person.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What if I just helped the two of you find a bigger apartment?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I don't know. I've got a lot of great memories in my old place.  And
      now they're gone.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: At least it's got a great view.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What the?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wow! Now this is fantastic!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hmm, I'm not sure we want to pay for a dimension we're not going to
      use.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, I give up. What's the catch?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Not one place even remotely liveable.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly...? To shreds, you say.
      Well, how is his wife holding up...? To shreds, you say. Very well then.  Sad,
      sad, terrible, gruesome news about my colleague, Dr. Mobootu.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Was his apartment rent-controlled?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wow, this is beautiful.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What's with all the crap?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's not crap.
  - character: HATTIE
    dialogue: Dr. Mobootu collected this crap while he was exploring the watcha-call-it...universe!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'Well, this place has everything except the only thing I care about:
      A TV.'
  - character: HATTIE
    dialogue: It's got a TV, you young watcha-call-it...idiot!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ooh!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa, slow down! This place just doesn't feel like home. It just isn't...cosy.
      Ahh, I can barely move.   It's perfect!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Man, it's a total sty! For the first time in a thousand years, I feel
      like I'm home.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah! It's gonna be fun on the bun! Y'know Fry, of all the friends I've
      had, you're the first.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Hey, mon!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Happy housewarming, Fry!  It's a miniature fruit salad tree.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ooh!  Hey, Amy!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hey!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: This is for you, Fry  Zevulon the Great. He's teriyaki style.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wow, heavy drinking crowd!  I'd better go out for more beer.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, hang on, All My Circuits is about to start!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I know, but I need alcohol to power up my batteries. If Calculon's wedding
      doesn't go just right I'll be emotionally and electrically drained.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: These are mighty tasty!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Thank you, I made them myself.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Shh, the wedding's about to start!
  - character: PRIESTBOT
    dialogue: If anyone here objects to this union, let them speak now or forever
      hold their --
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Is he objecting or backing up?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Looks like both.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: I'm afraid my half-brother is correct. You see, I have a terrible secret
      and that secret is --
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh, this isn't right.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Oh, come on!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Fix it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey what happened to the TV?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It just went out.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: This is an outrage! I'm gonna go yell at the manager!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Alright!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) Come back, Bender, its working!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: To reiterate, my terrible secret is --
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's out again.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What? That's the last straw!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's back on!
  - character: HATTIE
    dialogue: Pardon me. I don't mean to pry into what you're doing in here with the
      crab and the one-eyed lady and the Chinese girl but everyone on this floor is
      having trouble with their TV reception.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah! And you'd better get rid of whatever's causing it or we're outta
      this dump!
  - character: HATTIE
    dialogue: Relax, sonny. This kajigger'll find the source of the interference.
  - character: HATTIE
    dialogue: There's your problem.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh, my God, Bender, it's your thingy!
  - character: RANDY
    dialogue: Then get rid of it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You people are nuts. My antenna never interfered with my old TV.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You had cable. This is satellite.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Obviously your thoughts are being transmitted on the same frequency.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Madam, I believe you're mistaken!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wow, that lady's got a huge ass!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Those could be anyone's thoughts, fat ass!
  - character: RANDY
    dialogue: The robot has to go!
  - character: HATTIE
    dialogue: Well, you heard the mob!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fine! Come on, Fry, let's move to that apartment that smelled like a
      sewer. You liked that one, right?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's tempting, but, well, I am already kinda settled in here.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Or we could live underground with the mutants. A little fire'll show
      'em who's boss!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, listen, is there maybe some way we could do this with you going
      and me not going?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I don't understand.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, you were gonna live in the closet anyway. Won't you be just as
      happy back in your old place?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But, then we wouldn't be roommates.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'll come visit sometime. And you can visit me here.
  - character: HATTIE
    dialogue: No he can't.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This way we'll both be happy.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (downbeat) Happy. Yeah, that's Bender. Always happy.
  - character: RANDY
    dialogue: Hey, the TV's back on!
  - character: PRIESTBOT
    dialogue: We are gathered here to mourn the death of Calculon; Industrialist,
      private eye, friend.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Mind if I give the eulogy?
  - character: MONIQUE
    dialogue: Calculon! You're alive!
  - character: RANDY
    dialogue: Calculon's back!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Right, so long.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Goodbye.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: (crying) Do you think Calculon's evil twin will ever walk again?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: I don't know, Amy. I just don't know.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, thanks for coming.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, you're Bender's best friend. How could you let that mob kick him
      out?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ah, come on. Bender loves mobs.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Only when he's in them and you know it. You really hurt his feelings.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Don't girl me with that girl stuff. Bender and me are guys. Guys don't
      have feelings.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender's not a guy, he's a robot.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Same thing.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's so big and empty.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: My roommate's gone. And all he left behind was an eyelash and three
      skin flakes.  Oh, what's the point?!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender?  My God, you're a mess!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Leave me alone!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look at that five o'clock rust. You've been up all night not drinking,
      haven't you?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey. What I don't do is none of your business.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Please, Bender. Have some malt liquor. If not for yourself then for
      the people who love you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I hate the people who love me and they hate me.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, now look. It's obvious you miss being Fry's roommate. But there's
      got to be a better way to deal with this.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Like how? Having my antenna removed?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, if that would work.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Are you crazy? That's Little Bender you're talking about. I can't cut
      it off. You're not a robot or a man so you wouldn't understand. I gotta get
      out of here.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait! I want you to look me in the eye and promise you won't get behind
      the wheel without some kind of alcoholic beverage in your hand.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I promise nothing!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What up?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I can't just stand by and be silent about Bender anymore.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Silent? You've been meddling for two solid weeks.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well I can't just do that anymore. Your best friend is out there somewhere
      destroying himself.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Really? I didn't think he'd miss this apartment that much.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: He doesn't care about the apartment, he cares about you. And you turned
      your back on him.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew where he was I'd go talk to him.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, stupid TV!  Bender! You're blind stinking sober!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's right! I'm sober and crazy and I don't know what I might do!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Don't do it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I don't know what it is yet. Oh, yeah, now I remember. I thought I could
      live alone, but I can't. So, I'm gonna do what it takes to be your roommate
      again.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender! Stop!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Cutting Leela's head off won't solve anything!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No, I'm going to chop off my antenna.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give you a hand?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, don't help him mutilate himself.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But it's a useless antenna. It's not like he's a ham radio or something.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm gonna do it! I'm really gonna do it! Don't try and stop me! Here
      goes.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, it works! The static's gone.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Me too. I'm filled with a large number of powerful emotions.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You guys could learn a lesson from those two.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: She's right.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You're my best friend, Fry, I'm sorry I treated you so badly.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait a minute! You did it all backwards. Fry's the one who should be......Oh,
      never mind!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's wrong?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Nothing. I guess I'm just going to have to get used to being half a
      robot.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aww, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, if we found your antenna could
      they still reattach it?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Maybe. If we get it on ice right away.
  - character: SMITTY
    dialogue: Bingo!
  - character: URL
    dialogue: You call that an antenna?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: This time, you'll have all the human comfort. We'll get a couple of
      toilets, some food cookers, maybe a puppy.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's good to be home.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It sure is. By the way, I saved your stuff.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So that's where those skin flakes went. Hmm, do you think this fruit
      tree's going to get enough light?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: There's a window in the closet.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This is huge! Bender, why don't I just live in here?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: In a closet? Oh, humans!

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This place was a great choice. The food is amazing. And such generous
      portions.
  - character: DOUG
    dialogue: You like the meal just wait until you try these after dinner mints.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You know, Doug, most guys are put off by my eye. It's nice to finally
      meet someone who's open-minded.  Ew!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What was wrong with your date last night?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: "I don't know. Something I couldn\x92t quite put my finger on. Possibly\
      \ his vile lizard tongue."
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You're too picky.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah. If you rule out every guy with a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or
      an explosive violent temper, of course you're gonna be lonely.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: There's nothing wrong with having high standards. Now can we please
      stop --
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: The female Leela's problem is purely medical. Soon she will drop her
      eggs and they will hatch and all will be well.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You just have to give guys a chance. Sometimes you meet a guy and think
      he's a pig. But then later you realise he actually has a really good body.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thank you all for the inspiring advice, but I'm perfectly happy with
      my life the way it is.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That sounds like a cry for help.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Let's all take her out tonight. There's lots of great places to meet
      people.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: The Federal Sex Bureau.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: A saucy puppet show.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: The rotting carcass of a whale.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hmm, I'll pick!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh, wow, it's totally retro.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Why's everyone wearing those rings?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Guh! Because nobody wears them anymore! Rings are stupid!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I think they look cool.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Shh! Don't let anyone hear you say that!
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: Hey, did that guy just say rings are cool?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Nope, he said they're stupid.
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: Cool!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: So what do you think of that guy by the bar?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't know. Maybe?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Forget it, he's gay.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What?! How can you tell?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I just know these things. I've got what they call gaydar.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: There's no such thing.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No?  OK, I got a lock on him.  Yep! He's gay!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Are you sure?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Definitely. Unless I'm getting interference from a gay weather balloon.
  - character: WOMAN
    dialogue: You're from the 20th century? That's incredible! I'm from the 21st century.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No way! We've got so much in common.
  - character: WOMAN
    dialogue: We sure do. Remember when those cyborgs enslaved humanity?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, yeah! That rings a bell.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: This is Bolt Rolands. Bolt is a hyper-sled racer with 10 wins on the
      pro circuit.
  - character: BOLT
    dialogue: Hello, beautiful!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (whispering) I think she means 10 wins on the gay circuit.
  - character: BOLT
    dialogue: I wish! Those cats can really fly.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: This is M-5438, an entity of pure energy.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's great - really - but he's just not what I'm looking for.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You're impossible.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Just as well; I think he comes from a dimension that's big on musical
      theatre.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Psst, I need the apartment tonight. Go see a saucy puppet show.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Can do!
  - character: JANITOR
    dialogue: My, my, my! What's a beautiful lady like you --  Oh, my! Eurgh! I'm
      sorry, I thought you had two eyes.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So, Leela, you must have had your pick of the litter last night at closing
      time.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Could you guys please stop talking about my personal life?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes, let's all talk about Leela's personal life later. But right now
      we have business to attend to.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: A delivery?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No. A tax-deductible mission of charity.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: This is Vergon 6.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Buh!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It's a sunny little doomed planet, inhabited by a number of frisky little
      doomed animals.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Animals?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That's right. Animals in desperate need of rescue. You see, Vergon 6
      was once filled with a super dense substance known as dark matter, each pound
      of which weighs over ten thousand pounds.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait! What about the animals?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well, dark matter is extremely valuable as starship fuel. That's why
      it was all mined out, leaving the planet completely hollow.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yes, but what about the animals?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: The wha?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: The animals.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I didn't say anything about animals. Now it seems that the planet will
      collapse within three days. Incidentally, this will kill all the animals.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So we have to bring back two of each kind. Just like Noah's Ark.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Why two?  Oh!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I bet you Leela's holding out for a nice guy with one eye.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That'll take forever. What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two
      eyes, then poke one out.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, that'd be a timesaver.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Do you mind?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Here you go.  You can use this as an eye-poker.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thank you. But I don't care how many eyes a man has - as long as it's
      less than five. All I'm looking for is a guy who's adventurous, self-confident...
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: '...maybe a snappy dresser.'
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: These new uniforms are pretty snappy, eh, first officer?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: I suppose, captain. I'm as big a fan of velour as you are. Now what
      do you want to do about that unidentified ship?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Destroy them!  Mmm! That's got a nice feel to it.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Captain's journal; star date 3000.3.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Who are you talking to, sir?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: You! Aren't you getting this?  We have detected a vessel attempting
      to break the security cordon around Vergon 6. I'm anticipating an all-out tactical
      dogfight, followed by a light dinner...ravioli, ham, sundae bar.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh-huh!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Who's the Zapp Brannigan?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Shall I fire on them now, sir?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Not yet, Kif. In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary
      see your pieces.  What?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly saved the Octillian system from
      a horde of rampaging Killbots.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we can always build more Killbots!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: He's the most decorated captain in the whole Democratic Order Of Planets.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (teasing) Leela's got a boyfriend!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No I don't. But I think we ought to meet with him and see if he'll help
      us rescue those animals.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well just in case you guys hit it off you'll wanna take this with you.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Sir, they're headed straight for us.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: 'A well-calculated move straight out of Sun Tzu''s classic text The
      Art Of War, or my own masterwork: Zapp Brannigan''s Big Book Of War.  But the
      one thing their captain doesn''t realise and never will is that --'
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Sir, they've docked with us and have come aboard.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Then I have risked all and lost. Kif, old man, I'll be in the escape
      pod. If that wicker chair I like survives the slaughter, have it sent to my
      P.O. box.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet Express delivery ship. We've
      come aboard to plead for your assistance.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Well, if there's anything --
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I'm in command here. Zapp Brannigan. Has my fame preceded me or was
      I too quick for you?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, not at all. I'm just so uh...really thrilled to meet you!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: You're an impressive piece of captain. Beautiful and deadly - a potent
      combination.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (flattered) You don't mean that!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: But I do. I doubt I've seen more than three or four captains sexier
      than you, and only one who was deadlier.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I heard that one time you single-handedly defeated a horde of rampaging
      somethings in the something something system.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: The Killbots? A trifle! It was simply a matter of outsmarting them.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow! I never would have thought of that!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: You see, Killbots have a preset kill limit. Knowing their weakness,
      I sent wave after wave of my own men at them, until they reached their limit
      and shutdown. Kif, show them the medal I won.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: More, please.  A little more...more...keep going.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Captain Brannigan, we really need to talk to you about our mission.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Whatever it is, I'm willing to put wave after wave of men at your disposal.
      Right men?
  - character: CREWMAN
    dialogue: (shouting) You suck!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We're hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6 from extinction. And if
      you could just --
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Vergon 6?! This light dinner is over.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait! What's wrong?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: The Democratic Order Of Planets prohibits interfering with undeveloped
      worlds. It's a little rule known as "Brannigan's Law".
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But people already interfered. That planet was mined completely hollow.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Yes, by a Democratic Order Of Planets mining crew.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This doesn't make any sense.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I don't pretend to understand Brannigan's Law. I merely enforce it.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fine! We'll save the animals without your help.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I'm afraid I can't allow that. Guards!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What just happened?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: He's throwing us in prison.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Ow! I might've liked Zapp Brannigan if he weren't a pompous dimwit who
      threw me in prison.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You really are too picky.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Kif, follow me up to the observation deck. I've got some musing to do.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh, jeez!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I'm facing a formidable female adversary, Kif. Suggestions?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: I fail to see any problem sir. You already imprisoned her under directive
      B10.81.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: You mean Brannigan's Law?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Right, that law.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Which one?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Brannigan's Law.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: "Kif, you're my best and most loyal friend but you've earned my contempt\
      \ once again. As my prod\xE9g\xE9 you should know that the only way to deal\
      \ with a female adversary is to seduce her.  This time we are sure she's a woman,\
      \ right?"
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Yes.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Good! Invite her to my quarters. Oh, and have the boy lay out my formal
      shorts.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: The boy, sir?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: You. You lay out my formal shorts.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: The jackass wants to see you in his quarters.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Good. This will be my chance to reason with him, captain to captain.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: And he wants you to wear this.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Come and get it!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Welcome to my humble chamber. Or as I call it, "the Love-nasium". Shampagin?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Well I have studied abroad. Or two!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Captain...
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Uh-huh?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: '...if we could speak seriously for a moment...'
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Uh-huh?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: '...I''d like you to reconsider letting us rescue those animals.'
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Mm-hm.  I like your style. I find it very...(whispering)...erotic.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: (shouting) Erotic!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We can definitely escape, Bender. All you have to do is bend the hatch
      off this steam pipe.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, yeah!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No good! It's full of steam!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: You look like a woman who enjoys the finer things. Come over here and
      feel my velour bedspread.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm not really in the mood.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Leela, it's real velour. Just let yourself go.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Can I please just go back to prison?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: You'd rather sit in prison than spend one evening with the Zapper?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Much rather!  What are you doing?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: (crying) Oh, God, I'm pathetic. Sorry. Just go. You want the rest of
      the shampagin?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No, and it's pronounced "sham-pane".
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: (crying) Oh, God, no!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Its not a big deal.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: (crying) I get so lonely. I just thought you - a fellow captain - would
      understand.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, forget it.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: (crying) Yeah, it's great ordering people around and stuff but through
      it all you're completely alone.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It comes with the job.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: (crying) I'm just so lonely!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, come on, cheer up, it's not that bad.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You wanna try escaping again?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Nah, I'm comfy.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Man, Leela's been gone a long time. I hope she's at least making progress
      with Zapp Brannigan.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Good morning, lover.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, listen, Zapp.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Now you're officially my woman. Kudos! I can't say I don't envy you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Zapp, last night was a mistake.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: A sexy mistake.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No, just a regular mistake. For a split second my common sense was overwhelmed
      by pity.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: A split second is all it takes. That's why sooner or later you'll come
      crawling back to the Zapper.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: The only kind of crawling I'm doing to you is away - from!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Leela, you're obviously confused and aroused.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to save those animals whether you like
      it or not.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Go ahead. I won't stop you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Threaten all you -- wait, what?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: We both know you won't make it halfway to Vergon 6 before the craving
      sets in. Then you'll come crawling back for another taste of sweet, sweet candy...Bam!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Eurgh!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Kif!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Yes --  Yes, captain?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I have made it with a woman. Inform the men.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: The fatso says you're free to go.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Really? Why?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: (quietly) "Why" indeed.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What does that mean?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (defensively) Nothing.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So should we get our stuff and head down to the planet?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (defensively) We just talked, OK?!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Alright. We don't have much time to collect these animals. The planet
      is supposed to collapse in approximately two hours ago.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hello there.  Hmm, he doesn't seem to be on the checklist.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So you're saying we can cook him?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, a barbecue! I'll wear my hilarious apron.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No! I don't care how hilarious your apron is, we're not cooking him.  Aww,
      I'll call him Nibbler.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aww! (whispering to Fry) I'll fire up the grill!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I hope he'll be OK in there with all those big animals.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Y'know, Kif, once my woman returns I won't have much time to hang out
      with the boys anymore.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: That's a shame, sir.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: So let's make the most of our time together, shall we?  Never mind.
      Just give me a back rub.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I found a pair of Hermaphlamingoes.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Good. That's the last species.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey. What the?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Where'd they all go?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Nibbler!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I can't believe we flew halfway across the galaxy and enjoyed a steam
      just to get lunch for that stupid animal!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: He's pending for a bending.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Leave him alone. It's not his fault that he's an unstoppable killing
      machine. Is it, snoogums?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: The planet's kerploding!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Prepare for lift-off.  We're out of fuel. Bender, I told you to fill
      the tank before we left.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, I'll do it when we get back.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No way, forget it! I refuse to go crawling back to him!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What? What are you talking about?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (defensively) Nothing. We just talked.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So what's your problem? It's not like you slept with him.  Oh, my God!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: How could you, Leela? I thought you had some standards. I mean, jeez,
      he's a dumb, gross gorilla!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's enough. Don't you think I feel bad enough already?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Alright, alright I'll call him.  I mean if living is that important
      to you.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: And that's why you'll never make captain, Kif.  Hmmm.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hello, Zapp?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Well, well, well!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Zapp, we're out of fuel...
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: '...and Vergon 6 is about to implode. We need your help.'
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: So, crawling back to the Big Z like a bird on its belly. Delicious.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bird's don't crawl.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: They've been known to.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look, are you going to rescue us or not?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Can't you ask a little more...sexfully?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (sexfully) Please...
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: '...Big Z?'
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: 'Certainly. But first you''ll have to get rid of that thing.  That''s
      the law, Leela. And Brannigan''s Law is like Brannigan''s love: hard and fast!...'
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: '...Now put that greasy rat outside and we''ll tow you to safety.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I would never abandon a helpless animal. Y'know, Zapp, once I thought
      you were a big pompous buffoon. Then I realised that inside you were just a
      pitiful child. But now I realise that outside that child is a big pompous buffoon!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: And which one rocked your world?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow, way to tell that guy off. Now what's your secret escape plan?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, I guess to sit here and wait for death.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Can do!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What the hell was that?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Pew!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't believe it! It's dark matter.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: His species must've filled the entire planet with it. Did you do that,
      you cute little --  Come on. That should be more than enough fuel to get us
      outta here. Bender, pick it up and put it in the engine.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We made it!  And some of the animals survived.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So a couple of animals didn't die and Leela got lucky. That's what I
      call a successful mission!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We're heroes!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (thinking) Dear Captain's Diary. I may not have found love on this mission
      but I did find a cute little companion who excretes starship fuel. And that's
      just as good.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Captain's journal; star date...uh...
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: April 13th.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: April 13th...point two.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: We have failed to uphold Brannigan's Law. However, I did make it with
      a hot alien babe. And in the end is that not what man has dreamt of since first
      he looked up at the stars? Kif, I'm asking you a question!

- dialogues:
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What do you think of the view, Fry?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It really puts things in perspective. I mean, from up here an entire
      world can seem utterly insignificant.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, nice seats! We're close enough to when you knock a player down
      with a beer bottle, he stays down.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't get this. Is blernsball exactly the same as baseball?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Baseball? God forbid!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Face it, Fry. Baseball was as boring as mom and apple pie. That's why
      they jazzed it up.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Boring? Baseball wasn't -- hmm, so they finally jazzed it up?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Home run! Ha ha! Yay! Right?
  - character: UMPIRE
    dialogue: Out!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What just happened? Why is the ball on that springy thing?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's traditional. Just like aluminium bats and the seventh inning grope.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I got me a souvenir!  Aww, here you go, kid!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I'd like a jumbo squid log, please.
  - character: VENDOR
    dialogue: We don't sell those.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Alright, alright. Let me have one of your young on a roll.
  - character: VENDOR
    dialogue: We're outta rolls.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Fine! Just give me something crawling with parasites.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Mmm, at least hotdogs haven't changed.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, buddies, who wants popcorn?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Me!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, yes!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Yes, please, popcorn!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Anyone want butter on that?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, I'm starting to get the hang of this game. The blerns are loaded,
      the count's three blerns and two anti-blerns and the infield blern rule is in
      effect, right?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Except for the word "blern" that was complete gibberish.
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: Multi-ball!  Multi-ball!  Blern! Blerrrn!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Alright! Yes! Miller's on a pace to hit 70 blerns!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: He's good, alright. But he's no Clem Johnson. And Johnson played back
      in the days before steroid injections were mandatory.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't have lasted one pitch in the old
      Robot Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there was a blern hitting machine!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Exactly! He was a machine designed to hit blerns! I mean, come on, Wireless
      Joe was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, and I suppose Pitchomat 5000 was just a modified howitzer?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yep.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You humans are so scared of a little robot competition you won't even
      let us on the field.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What are you talking about? There's all kinds of robots down there.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, doing crap work! They're bat boys, ball polishers, sprinkler systems.
      But how many robot managers are there?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 11?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Zero!  And what a surprise! Look who's scraping up the filth. Is it
      a human child? I wish!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, dear Lord!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's wrong?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It's...my...new pager.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I'm sorry, wha?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'Admit it: You all think robots are just machines built by humans to
      make their lives easier.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, aren't they?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I've never made anyone's life easier and you know it!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Great news, everyone. You'll be delivering a package to Chapek 9, a
      world where humans are killed on sight.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Why is that great news?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I'm glad you asked that question, Fry. You see, Chapek 9 was colonised
      centuries ago by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, so just 'cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a "radical"?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey, hold on. I understand these robots hate humans, but how do they
      feel about humanoid aliens?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: They're not fans.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: That's why Bender will have to make the actual delivery.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, I get it, make the robot do all the work!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This is the first actual work you've ever had to do around here.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Really? Which one?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, come on, Bender. Last month it was Robomadom and before that Robonza.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Man, that one was a blast!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It wasn't just a blast. It was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes
      which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Now, look here, Bender. I respect your diversity to the extent the law
      requires but you used up all your days off when you had that bout with Roberculosis.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Alright, I'll go. But so help me, I'll hold a grudge against every last
      stinking one of you for the rest of your lives.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well then it's settled. So long, everyone!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'So let me get this straight: This planet is completely uninhabited?'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No. It's inhabited by robots!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, Bender, we're here. It's time to get to work.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes, Miss Leela. Tote that space barge, lift that space pale.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'Now we can''t land on the surface because those robots will kill Fry
      and me. So we''ll have to stay up here and lower you with the winch. And remember:
      You don''t know humans, you don''t work for humans, and, above all, you don''t
      like humans.'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (ironic) I'll try to keep that in mind!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hmm, he seems pretty angry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, but I guess I'd be kinda angry too if I had to go to some uninhabited
      planet.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Maybe we ought to do something nice for him.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: There! This oughta show that stupid robot we care about him.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm in trouble. They found out I work with humans and -- oh, no! Oh,
      no!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, my God! We have to go down and rescue him.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No, we can't! They'll kill us on sight.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: W-what are we gonna do?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't know! I don't know! It's not an easy decision. If only I had
      two or three minutes to think about it.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK. If we're going to save Bender, we've got to look and act exactly
      like robots.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (mechanical voice) I am fully operational, captain.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We'll have to walk like robots, talk like robots and, if necessary,
      solve complex differential equations like robots.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I can sorta dance like a robot. Will that help?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'Fry, first of all this is serious. And second of all:'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten store-bought costumes.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's in this quadrant.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Robot...we be.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, yup! Just two robots out roboting it up!  Eh?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) C!  (talking) Is the puppy mechanical in any way?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Then we'll go with that data file.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Now if you see any robots, just stay out of their way.  (shouting) So
      far, so good.
  - character: CONSTRUCTIONBOT
    dialogue: Little to the right, there you go.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Have you seen this robot?
  - character: CONSTRUCTIONBOT
    dialogue: Sorry, can't help you.  Hey, watch it! Don't drop that there!  Oh!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Come on, Fry, walk like a robot.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I can't. I have to go to the bathroom.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Robots don't have bathrooms.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, right. I wonder where they smoke in high school.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Listen. Just go behind those garbage cans. I'll stand guard.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hurry up, Fry!
  - character: ROBOT
    dialogue: Sir? Are you aware that you're leaking coolant at an alarming rate?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh...
  - character: ROBOT
    dialogue: Lemme just patch you up with some hot resin.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I think the leak's stopping itself. Wait. Wait. Yeah, there we go. Wait.
      Yeah!
  - character: ROBOT
    dialogue: What sort of robot turns down a free blast of searing-hot resin?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm sorry. My friend and I have to go and perform some mindless repetitive
      tasks.
  - character: ROBOT
    dialogue: Sounds like a romantic evening. I won't keep you.
  - character: ANNOUNCER
    dialogue: Intruder alert! Intruder alert!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Quick! Let's duck in here!
  - character: ANNOUNCER
    dialogue: 'We interrupt this sound file to bring you a terrifying announcement:
      A non-metallic being has been sighted in the vicinity of Make Out Point.'
  - character: RUSTY
    dialogue: Say, Wendy. Your chassis is a little scuffed. Mind if I polish it for
      you?
  - character: WENDY
    dialogue: Did you here that, Rusty? It sounded like a human.
  - character: RUSTY
    dialogue: Relax, Wendy. Humans will never come to our defenceless little town.
      Its perfectly safe to let our guard down -- even for a second.
  - character: HUMAN
    dialogue: I will eat and digest you all with my system of mighty organs. Behold!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow, the 3-D's great!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Mine's not working.
  - character: WENDY
    dialogue: I'm just glad the nightmare is over.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: God help us!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK. Keep an eye out for Bender.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Umm, too much romance, not enough human killing.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What's that?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Try to stay with the crowd so no one notices how crummy you look.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm over here.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's him! He's OK!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Death to humans!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ahh! It's good to hear his voice!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Many said I was too extreme when I first called for the annihilation
      of the human species, as well as some of the more cunning monkeys. But after
      living on Earth I can tell you that I am, if anything, too merciful!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: My God! He's become evil.  I mean eviler!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Thank you! Thank you! And if you enjoyed that diatribe then you'll want
      to purchase my spoken word album, just 18.95! Act now and you'll get this Bender
      action figurine.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Now, your basic human is between three- and 25-feet tall and is made
      of a hairy, oily goo wrapped in a t-shirt.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Sure, why not?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Nothing. Today's active humans prefer a low-calorie bait.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wait! What's that?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hmm, sounds like a breeding ground for humans. I'd better check it out.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, yeah! You're a bad girl, aren't you?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Psst! Bender!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Huh? Wha? You! What the hell are you doing here?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We've been looking for you. Last we heard you were under arrest as a
      human sympathiser.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I was. But they let me go when I told them I killed a million billion
      humans.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Good for you. Now let's all get back to the ship.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What for?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We're rescuing you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I don't wanna be rescued.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Say what?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I love this planet. I've got wealth, fame and access to the depths of
      sleaze that those things bring.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But, Bender, we're your friends.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Friends? That activates my hilarity unit! I'm just a machine to you.
      You're no more friends with me than you are with the toaster or the phonograph
      or the electric chair.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's not true.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well that's how it feels to me.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bye, Bender. I'll miss you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Go on, get out of here before you get caught.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh...got you...you murderous flesh piles!
  - character: JUDGE
    dialogue: Thank you, prosecutor. I will now consider the evidence.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, wait a minute! Isn't anyone going to defend us?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah! I mean he might not have a case but I'm genuinely not a human.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Call technical support.
  - character: JUDGE
    dialogue: I find the defendants - guilty!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'Look! One eye! Count them: One! Not human!'
  - character: JUDGE
    dialogue: The humans are hereby sentenced to live as robots live on Earth. They
      will perform tedious calculations and spot-weld automobiles, until they become
      obsolete and are given away to an inner-city middle school.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Are you alright?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, yeah.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Who are you?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You don't look very old.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What's going on here?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Alright, let's make this quick, I'm due at the opening of a mini-mall.
      Hey! What is this?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But the judge already sentenced us at the trial!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would it be alright if I just gave
      'em a savage beating?
  - character: ELDERS
    dialogue: (chanting) Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do
      it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aww!  I can't kill them. Plenty of humans have mistreated robots but
      not these two. They're my friends. Humans are no threat to us. They're stupid,
      putrid cowards.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Damn right!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: The fact is, humans are completely harmless.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You are?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, I'm glad we got all that out in the open. We'll just let ourselves
      out.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Stop! Take one more step and I'll breathe fire on you!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: He'll do it. He's crazy!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So long, suckers!  Uh, hello, suckers!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, hold on a second, I forgot to deliver the package.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wow, I can't believe you guys did all this for me! This is the best
      Robanukah ever!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We wanted to show you that we really do respect your robot heritage.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aww, thanks! You do know that I made Robanukah up to get out of work,
      right?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Of course.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But that doesn't make it any less meaningful.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: In that case, let the dancing begin! Hey, you guys are good. How the
      hell do you do that?

      it a rest, you two!

  - character: TEACHER
    dialogue: Good morning, class. I trust you've all prepared for today's final exam.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, excuse me? I missed a few lectures. Uh, what subject is this?
  - character: TEACHER
    dialogue: Ancient Egyptian algebra.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What a nightmare!
  - character: TEACHER
    dialogue: Mister Fry, are those your underpants? Young man, I think it's time
      you learned a lesson about Lightspeed brand briefs.
  - character: ANNOUNCER
    dialogue: (voice-over) Lightspeed fits today's active lifestyle. Whether you're
      on the job......or having fun... Lightspeed briefs. Style and comfort for the
      discriminating crotch.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What a weird dream! I'll never get back to sleep.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So you're telling me they broadcast commercials into people's dreams?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Of course.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But, how is that possible?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It's very simple. The ad gets into your brain just like this liquid
      gets into this egg.  Although in reality it's not liquid, but gamma radiation.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's awful. It's like brainwashing.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Didn't you have ads in the 20th century?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only on TV and radio. And in magazines
      and movies and at ball games and on buses and milk cartons and t-shirts and
      written in the sky. But not in dreams. No siree!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Quit squawking, flesh wad, nobody's forcing you to buy anything.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Yeah. I mean we all have commercials in our dreams but you don't see
      us running off to buy brand name merchandise at low, low prices.
  - character: SALESWOMAN
    dialogue: Hi! Care to sample the latest fragrance from Calvin Clone?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: No thanks.
  - character: SALESWOMAN
    dialogue: And you, sir?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No thanks I --
  - character: COSMETOLOGIST
    dialogue: What a lovely face. We just need to draw attention away from the eye
      area.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Cool.  Can I try these on before I buy them?
  - character: SALESMAN
    dialogue: I'm afraid I can't let you open the package. But you can try on the
      demo pair.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: ': Ooh! Ho ho ho!'
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hey, Bender! Great new sweater.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: New? What sweater? I came in with it. I don't know you people!
  - character: SALESMAN
    dialogue: $30, please.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: $30? I can't afford that. Unless... Do you take Visa?
  - character: SALESMAN
    dialogue: Visa hasn't existed for 500 years.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: American Express?
  - character: SALESMAN
    dialogue: 600 years.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Discover card?
  - character: SALESMAN
    dialogue: Sorry we don't take Discover.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hey! You're springing for Lightspeed? Pretty ritzy!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, I can't afford them. Being poor sucks. What kind of world is this
      where they advertise things not everybody can afford?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Quiet. There's an ad coming on.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Hello shoppers. It's me, Mom!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey who's the rocker jockey?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Guh! It's Mom. The world's most huggable industrialist.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Call me old fashioned, but when my robot starts to squeak like an old
      screen door well, that's when I reach for a can of Mom's Old Fashioned Robot
      Oil.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Mmm, tasty!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: 'And remember: Mom''s oil is made with 10% more love than the next leading
      brand!'
  - character: ANNOUNCER
    dialogue: '"Mom", "love" and "screen door" are registered trademarks of Mom Corp.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, Bender. Sounds like you could use a little of that oil.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm boned.
  - character: SMITTY
    dialogue: Freeze scuzzbot!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, there's obviously been some sort of a mistake here.  I'm sure there's......I
      say I'm sure there's......that is, I'm sure there's...a very...reasonable...
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Do we have enough money to pay Bender's fine?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 78, 79. 79.50. Crud! We're 50 cents short.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'd love to chip in, but Bender stole my wallet.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, that's my old bank. Maybe my account's still open.
  - character: TELLER
    dialogue: Hmm. We don't seem to have your retina scan, your fingerprint or your
      colonic map on file.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, well, I did open the account over a thousand years ago. What about
      my ATM card?
  - character: TELLER
    dialogue: Do you still remember your PIN number?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I
      used to work, Panucci's Pizza.
  - character: TELLER
    dialogue: OK, you had a balance of 93 cents...
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Alright!
  - character: TELLER
    dialogue: '...and at an average of 2 and a quarter percent over a period of 1000
      years, that comes to...$4.3 billion.'
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: To Fry.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Cheers!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I know Fry's rich, but do we really have to wear these top hats?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Maybe you don't understand just how rich he is. In fact, I think I'd
      better put on a monocle.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Pizza dinner on me!  Just keep the tab under $50 million.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, yeah. We'll have one with everything but anchovies and one with
      my all time favourite topping, anchovies!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Anchovies? You know? Those little headless fish?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I'm sorry, Fry, but the anchovy has been extinct since the 2200's.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What?!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, my, yes. Fished to death. Just about the time your people arrived
      on Earth wasn't it, Zoidberg?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (defensively) I'm not on trial here.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So none of you has ever had anchovies? Oh, man! You don't know what
      you're missing. They were all salty and oily and they melted in your mouth and
      --
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Stop! Stop! I admit it! My people ate them all! We kept saying "One
      more can't hurt" and then they were gone. We're sorry!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I just wished I could've showed you guys how great they were. I may
      be rich but I still can't buy back all the things I miss from the 20th century.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Maybe you're forgetting just how rich you are.  Huh? Huh?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So? What do you think?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I know you spent a lot of money on this place, Fry, but it's awfully
      primitive. The floors are made of such hard wood.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey! Get a load of this pathetic 20th century TV!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's wrong with it?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, aside from causing eye cancer, these things had a lousy low-definition
      picture.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: That's true. On a TV like this I bet you couldn't even make out my obscene
      tattoo.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's cute!
  - character: AUCTIONEER
    dialogue: Sold!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yes!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I just don't get it. Who was this Ted Danson? And why would you pay
      $10,000 for his skeleton?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I have an idea for a sitcom.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah, leave him alone, Leela. So he's going a little wacko with his money.
      It's OK.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You're just saying that because he bought you that antique robot toy.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, it is cute.
  - character: AUCTIONEER
    dialogue: 'Now, our final item: This unopened can of Angry Norwegian brand anchovies
      circa 1997.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Anchovies?!
  - character: AUCTIONEER
    dialogue: The last known can in existence guaranteed fresh and edible. Do I hear
      $10,000?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 15,000!
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: 20!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 50,000!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Are you crazy? It's a can of old fish.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Don't tell me how to spend my money.
  - character: AUCTIONEER
    dialogue: 50 going once, twice...
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: 75,000.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, my God, it's Mom! I've never seen her in person before.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 100,000.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, you can't bid against Mom. She's the richest, most powerful person
      in the world. And she's so adorable.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Well, I suppose I could go as high as...300,000.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 500!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Oh, mercy be. A million.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Two.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Six.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 14!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: I can see the nice young man really wants those little fish. Nevertheless,
      I'll bid 23 million.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: One jillion dollars.
  - character: AUCTIONEER
    dialogue: Sir, that's not a number.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh. In that case, 50 million.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Well, boys, your old mother knows when she's been beat.  You win, young
      man. I tip my bonnet to you.
  - character: AUCTIONEER
    dialogue: What a class act! Sold! To the gentleman who bought every item in today's
      auction.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Now for some good old 20th century TV.
  - character: ANNOUNCER
    dialogue: Do you remember a time when chocolate chip cookies came fresh from the
      oven? Petridge Farm remembers.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ah, those were the days.
  - character: ANNOUNCER
    dialogue: Do you remember a time when women couldn't vote and certain folk weren't
      allowed on golf courses? Petridge Farm remembers.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry? Are you there?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Eh?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You haven't been to work in three days. What have you been doing?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I've been sitting right here. I picked up my life exactly where I left
      off a thousand years ago. Now if you'll excuse me it's 8 o'clock. Time to get
      biz-ay!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I could if you hadn't turned on the lights and shut off the stereo.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, this isn't healthy. You're living in the past.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm rich! I can live whenever I want.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But we're your friends and we live here in the year 3000.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah. Now are you gonna come to the squid fights with us or sit here
      wallowing in your prehistoric junk?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'Junk? Maybe you can''t understand this but I''ve finally found what
      I need to be happy, and it''s not friends: It''s things.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Just leave me alone.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry please.   My ponytail's caught in the door.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't need them. Not when I have my antique videos, my bucket of fossilised
      KFC and 50 million dollars worth of anchovies.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Mercy me, what a day.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Could you shut the door, Igner dear? I think I feel a draught coming
      on. Holy crap, that bastard's itchy!  Walt! Cream soda!
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: Right away, mother.  Larry, get your mother a cream soda.
  - character: LARRY
    dialogue: But Mom said --
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: You heard me.
  - character: IGNER
    dialogue: What's wrong, Mommy?
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: It's those damned anchovies. That dirtbag, Fry, must know their secret.
      And I won't rest until I get my hands on them. No one messes with Mom!
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: Quiet, you!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: 'As you boys know, one of the cornerstones of my empire is Mom''s Old
      Fashioned Robot Oil. Think of it: 10 billion robots. Each one needing an oil
      change every 3000 miles. You don''t have to do the math to know that''s a buttload
      of oil.'
  - character: IGNER
    dialogue: Can I wear your fat suit?
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: '(shouting): No, Igner, put that down.'
  - character: IGNER
    dialogue: Aww.
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: What does this have to do with the anchovies?
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: I'm getting to the freaking anchovies. A single drop of the anchovies
      natural oil would lubricate 10 robots permanently.
  - character: LARRY
    dialogue: Wow, it's a shame they went extinct.
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: My God! This Mr. Fry must be a mastermind of the highest order.
  - character: FRED
    dialogue: Esther, you ugly!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: 'We have only one option: We''ll have to bankrupt Mr Fry, so he''ll
      be forced to sell the anchovies to us.'
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: Mother, you are one clever old skag!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: And don't you forget it!
  - character: LARRY
    dialogue: But how are we supposed to get Fry's money out of the bank?
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: That part will be easy, thanks to the nice people at Mom's Old Fashioned
      Video Surveillance Unit.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: You know what needs to be done.
  - character: LARRY
    dialogue: What?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I didn't order any --
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: Quick! Give him the tranquilliser.
  - character: LARRY
    dialogue: That's a good boy.
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: Wake up, Mr. Fry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Where am I?
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: You're in the good old year 2000, working here at Panucci's Pizza. You
      fell asleep on the job.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That sounds like me but, I thought I got frozen. Wasn't I in the future?
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: No, you only "dreamed" you were in the year 3000.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So I'm really back? That's exactly what I wanted, I guess. Who are you?
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: I'm Mr. Panucci.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You are? Did you grow a moustache since last night?
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: No. Now go work the currency register. I think I hear a customer coming...I
      said "I think I hear a customer coming"!
  - character: ANDERSON
    dialogue: Hurry up, please. I wanna get back to the head museum.
  - character: LARRY
    dialogue: Don't worry, Miss Anderson, this won't take long. Now, your motivation
      is you're back in the year 2000 and your head's still on your body, and you
      want a cheese pizza.
  - character: ANDERSON
    dialogue: OK, but I'm only doing this so people will take my head seriously as
      an actress.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, look! Anchovies!
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: Of course. They're not extinct yet. And if you need further proof that
      this is really a thousand years ago well, here's contemporary actress, Pamela
      Anderson!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ooh!
  - character: ANDERSON
    dialogue: 'Hello, Fry. Remember me from Baywatch: The Movie?'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh...
  - character: ANDERSON
    dialogue: It was the first movie to be shot entirely in slow motion.

    dialogue: Nope.
  - character: ANDERSON
    dialogue: Crap!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait. You're Pamela Anderson! Cool! What can I get you?
  - character: ANDERSON
    dialogue: Oh, I'll have a cheese pizza and a large...uh...line?
  - character: ANDERSON
    dialogue: Oh, right! Cheese pizza and a large soda!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, cheese and a --  That was quick!
  - character: ANDERSON
    dialogue: So. What do I owe you?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 10.77. Same as my PIN number.
  - character: IGNER
    dialogue: Hey, you don't get to laugh.
  - character: IGNER
    dialogue: Thanks a billion!
  - character: LARRY
    dialogue: More like 4.3 billion!
  - character: IGNER
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: LARRY
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, I had a nightmare I was in the year 2000 and you guys never existed.
      I'm so glad I'm awake now and you're really here.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Since when do you care about us?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: We thought you only cared about cans of anchovies and stuffy old songs
      about the buttocks.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, that's not true!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Goodbye-eee!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wheee!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender! Leela! Don't leave me. Wait a minute! Hey, buddy what year is
      this?
  - character: REPOBOT
    dialogue: Uh, 3000.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 3000? Yes! I'm still in the future! Life is wonderful!  Wait! What are
      you doing with my stuff?
  - character: REPOBOT
    dialogue: Uh, check bounced. We're taking it all back.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, no, my ATM card! My secret PIN number! 1077. I've got nothing left.
      Except...
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You're Fry's relative. Do you have any idea how he got so crazy?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Uh, wha? Oh, yes, they say madness runs in our family. Some even call
      me mad! And why? Because I dared to dream of my own race of atomic monsters.
      Atomic supermen with octagonal-shaped bodies that suck blood out of...
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela! Bender! I missed you so much!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You did? What happened?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I was robbed. They got everything except these.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Who did?
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Hello, Fry.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's Mom.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: I felt terrible when I heard about your money troubles and I thought
      maybe I could help out a sweet young man by buying his anchovies.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sorry. But the anchovies aren't for sale.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: What? Listen, you little bastard. I control the robot oil business and
      I won't let you ruin me. How much do you want?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You might as well put that chequebook away, because I've discovered
      something even more important. My friends. And they aren't worth even a penny
      to me. That's why these anchovies are going on a pizza, so I can share the food
      I love with the people I like.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Holy hell! You're going to eat them? Oh, well. Just make sure you eat
      them all. You're a growing boy. Toodle-oo! Dumb ass!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What a nice lady!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: OK, my friends. Get ready for the most delicious extinct animal you've
      ever tasted.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I don't know, I've had cow.  Ew! Gross!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ah, no one likes them at first but they'll grow on you.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: That stench. That heavenly stench! More!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: There aren't any more. And there never will be.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: More! More! More! More!

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) Goin' through the robot wash!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah!  Aww!
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Hey, I'm Elzar! Welcome to the show! You know, you don't have to drive
      all the way to Neptune for great Neptunian food. Today we're gonna kick it up
      a notch as I show you how to fricassee a mouth-watering Neptunian slug.  Now
      while you grease the pan and preheat your oven to 3500 degrees you're gonna
      separate the yolk from your genetically-enhanced eggplant and then give the
      whole thing a good blast from your spice weasel - bam!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, what you watching?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, nothing!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Is that a cooking show?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No, of course not! It was...uh...porno! Yeah that's it!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender! I didn't know you liked cooking! That's so cute!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (ashamed) Oh, it's true! I've been hiding it for so long.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Its OK, Bender, I like cooking too.
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: 'Of course, your most important ingredient is this baby right here:
      the Neptunian slug. You can get it in a can but to really do things right you
      gotta strangle yourself a fresh one.  Now this is why you gotta use cast-iron
      cookware.'
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Bender, man. It has come to my attention that this company has been
      paying you to do nothing but loaf about on the couch.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: I'm sorry but if you want to continue drawing a salary you gotta do
      more than watch the cooking shows all day.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hmm.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You're gonna be the ship's cook?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah! We're gonna kick it up a notch. Bam!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I know you like cooking shows but you're a robot, you don't even have
      a sense of taste.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if I was wearing a lime green tank
      top.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bam!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So this is Little Neptune?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yep. Every chef knows that this is the place to get exotic gourmet ingredients.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Among other things.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ooh! What's this?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hmm, I can see where that would be an advantage. Do you take cash?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, you have to be more careful. We're not in the 20th century. You
      don't know how things work here.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew up in this city. These are my people.
      What up?
  - character: ALIEN
    dialogue: Word!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: See?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow! You guys sell every kind of meat here except human!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What's this spice for?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh! That's ridiculous. (whispering) I'll take two pounds!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, buddy. I'm looking for fresh slug.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whatever.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, yeah, either one's fine.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey, have you seen Fry?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Now that you mention it, I do have trouble breathing underwater sometimes.
      I'll take the gills.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Can't imagine why I would.
  - character: NURSE
    dialogue: Let's do it.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Thank you!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What the hell were you doing? I warned you to stay away from those guys.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm capable of making my own decisions, Leela. Did you ever stop to
      think I might be happier with gills?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good news, everyone...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: '...you''ll be making a delivery to the planet Trisol...'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Here it comes.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: '...A mysterious world in the darkest depths of the Forbidden Zone.'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Thank you, and goodnight.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, Professor, are we even allowed in the Forbidden Zone?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Why, of course! Its just a name! Like the Death Zone or the Zone Of
      No Return. All the zones have names like that in the Galaxy Of Terror!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, Professor...
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Off you go, pleasant trip.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) Hey Bender how's dinner coming?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Almost ready!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Now for a dash of salt!  Uh-oh!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (whispering) Listen, this is Bender's first meal and he's a little sensitive.
      So let's be supportive, OK?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, OK.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Alright.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) Oh, dear God!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. And I once a big heaping
      bowl of salt!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Bender, is this salt water?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's salt with water in it if that's what you mean.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna die.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less
      than a lethal dose.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Uh-oh, I shouldn't have had seconds.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, Fry, here's the package to deliver and for once in your life be
      careful. This is my first visit to the Galaxy Of Terror and I'd like it to be
      a pleasant one.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Don't touch anything or talk to anyone. Just go to the palace, drop
      it off and come right back.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering things before you were born!
      I think I know what I'm doing.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty. Oh, come on! Go down already!  Ah!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hello? Anybody home?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No! It wasn't me!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I didn't mean to. He just looked so cool and refreshing.
  - character: GUARDS
    dialogue: (chanting) Hail! Hail! Hail!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So after I specifically asked you not to touch anything, you drank a
      bottle of strange blue liquid? It could have been poisonous acid!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It could have been. But chances were equally good it was an Emperor.
  - character: MERG
    dialogue: Excuse me, Your Majesty, I am Merg, the High Priest. If I might interject?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You might.
  - character: MERG
    dialogue: I humbly advise that as your first act you choose a capable Prime Minister.
      I suggest Gorgak, the previous appointee.
  - character: GORGAK
    dialogue: I will be a forceful and effective administrator.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You know, Fry, I've often thought about becoming a Prime Minister.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I gotta go with Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes! In your face, Gorgak!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's it, Fry. As your captain I order you back to the ship. You are
      in way over your head.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better check with my Prime Minister.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Stay the course, pal!
  - character: GORGAK
    dialogue: Your Highness, a package came for you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, thanks!  Wow! This got here just in time.
  - character: MERG
    dialogue: This is Your Majesty's harem. You may choose any of these maidens to
      be your royal consort.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Umm, how about that one?
  - character: MERG
    dialogue: Oh! I didn't realise Your Majesty was into that sort of thing!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: On second thought, I'll take that one.
  - character: MERG
    dialogue: Hey, whatever you say, I'm not here to pass judgement.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Does anyone else think it's odd that a shiftless 25-year-old delivery
      boy could drop out of the sky, kill the emperor and be rewarded instead of punished?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You don't have to beat around the bush, Leela, we all know who you're
      talking about...uh, me, right?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I don't think you have anything to worry about. These people seem really
      mild-mannered.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: They are mild. In fact, you're soaking in one right now.
  - character: GORGAK
    dialogue: You touched me in ways I've never been touched before.
  - character: MERG
    dialogue: Ah, there you are, Your Majesty. It's time to begin preparing for tomorrow's
      coronation ceremony.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: A fancy dress gala! I'll wear my formal shell.
  - character: MERG
    dialogue: Fry will be enthroned tomorrow at the setting of the three suns when
      we Trisolians enter our nocturnal phase.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: There won't be a lot of long-winded speeches, will there?
  - character: MERG
    dialogue: Only one. The absolutely flawless recitation from memory of the royal
      oath. By you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Will there be cake?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Yeah, I know.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hi!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: There you go.
  - character: GORGAK
    dialogue: And now, get ready to laugh til your sides leak with our planet's foremost
      political satirist, Florp!
  - character: FLORP
    dialogue: So what is the deal with people from under the orange sun? They're all...
      But us guys from under the red sun, we're like... Right? Am I right?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (whispering) Fry, I have to talk to you. You're in terrible danger.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You see Emperor Plon here?  He met his end when he was drunk by Emperor
      Strug. And before he could even wipe his mouth, Strug was drunk by Shwab.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look at all these guys. Do you have any idea what the average length
      of their reigns was?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 80,000 years?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No. One week.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really
      low.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one. And
      guess who's next?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well at least my assassin will get what's coming to him.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You're in tremendous danger, you idiot! Half of these Emperors were
      drunk at their own coronation.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis myself.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No, they were assassinated. In fact, the law says you'll be killed on
      the spot if you fail to recite the oath from memory.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, I was going to thumb through that later.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That is completely reckless. Don't you ever think ahead?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, I wouldn't be Emperor. And I
      wouldn't even be here in the year 3000. It's just like the story of the grasshopper
      and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter
      while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter
      came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he
      got a racecar. Is any of this getting through to you?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I give up! You're gonna get yourself killed and this time I won't be
      here to save you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Who asked you to? I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like
      a baby. Now go. Go gather your nuts you nagging grasshopper.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's it! I'm never helping you again! If anyone except you needs me,
      I'll be in the ship.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's gonna drink me.  Quit it!
  - character: MERG
    dialogue: People of Trisol, it is my honour to present your new Emperor!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What up?
  - character: MERG
    dialogue: Stick to the oath.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, who drank Ungo the Moist,
      who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant...
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: '...who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed a soup composed principally
      of Throm the Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule with honour and insanity - uh,
      integrity!'
  - character: MERG
    dialogue: Congratulations, Your Highness.  I now present you with your royal unisex
      robe. Long live Fry The Solid!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, look. The suns are setting. I can finally switch to hard liquor!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Check out the glowing freaks. It's beautiful! Hey, what's that?
  - character: MERG
    dialogue: The Emperor Bont! He's still alive.
  - character: BONT
    dialogue: Of course I'm alive. Now cut this creep open and drain me out!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: My tummy hurts!
  - character: BONT
    dialogue: They're over here, they're running up the stairs.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Shut up, you!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: MERG
    dialogue: Let us in!
  - character: MERG
    dialogue: Fry must die so that Bont may live.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What am I gonna do?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: We've gotta get the Emperor out of your body before they kill you!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in a high-speed centrifuge separating
      out the denser fluid of His Highness.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But won't that crush my bones?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Oh, right, right, with the bones! I always forget about the bones.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, why don't you just sweat him out?
  - character: BONT
    dialogue: Forget it! As Emperor I refuse to be dripped out through somebody's
      armpit.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I could vomit or urinate. Would you feel better about that?
  - character: BONT
    dialogue: Slightly. But my favourite so far is the bone-crushing.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: What about crying?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's a great idea! Crying.
  - character: BONT
    dialogue: Fine. That or the bone one.
  - character: MERG
    dialogue: Keep it up, men. The veneer is starting to peel.
  - character: GORGAK
    dialogue: Oh, dear!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just too macho.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'll make you cry, buddy!  You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll
      never amount to anything.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What do you mean? I was Emperor of a whole planet.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'Good point. But here''s a disturbing reminder: Everyone you knew or
      loved in the 20th century is dead.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: These things happen.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no God and your
      idiotic human ideals are laughable!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Phew! That's a load off my mind.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Man, I guess it's harder than I thought to make someone cry.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You did your best, Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Up yours, bimbo!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Let's face it, we're in hot butter here. We should call Leela for help.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Cram it, lobster!  That is a good idea. I'll go call her.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: She'll never help me. She's still mad that I told her never to help
      me.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: C'mon. Leela's not the type to hold a grudge.
  - character: OPERATOR
    dialogue: Collect call from...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm not giving my name to a machine.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'll accept.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fry's in trouble...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: '...and he needs help. Now, I don''t like you and you don''t like me.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I like you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You do? Look are you going to help or not?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't know why I should. I mean after what he --
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What is it you like best about me?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Is she coming?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm not sure. But I do know that she likes my in-your-face attitude.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What the hell is that?
  - character: BONT
    dialogue: Its the Juice-A-Matic 4000. It'll strain my juices from you while filtering
      out the pulp. By which I mean, your shredded remains.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Of course! Why didn't I think of that!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This is the saddest day of my life. And I still can't cry.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wait a second. Here comes Leela.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh, no. They have her totally outnumbered.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I can't believe it. She's risking her life for me after the way I treated
      her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You do? Hmm.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Is she alright?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out this window. Oh, dear God in heaven,
      they're swarming all over her.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No. No!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: What are you talking about, Bender? She's al --  (muffled) Oh!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, they're putting some ice cubes
      in the glass under it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This can't be happening.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It can and, for all you know, it is. I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: All Leela ever wanted to do was help me. But I was to proud, too stupid
      to accept it.  I wish I had died instead of her.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What are you talking about?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela! You're alive!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Of course I'm alive.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I told Fry you were dead so he would cry out the Emperor but you had
      to go and wreck it by surviving.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: We only got two drops.
  - character: BONT
    dialogue: It's only a matter of time now.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I'll handle this!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out of this if you're willing to let
      me help you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take all the help you're willing to
      give. I know you just want what's best for me.  Ow! What was that for?  Hey,
      come on!  That hurt!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I know. Amy, get the bottle.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (crying) Oh, now I understand.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Come on. Everybody help out Fry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (crying) Thanks, everybody. I love you all. You guys are true -- ow!
      Cut it out, Bender! That's a tender area!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: How we doing, Amy?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Great! We're one-tenth of the way there.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: OK, it's your turn.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?
  - character: BONT
    dialogue: I'm the Emperor! Thanks for crying me out.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, you're welcome.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey! Save some for me!

  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good news, everyone. Tomorrow you'll be making a delivery to Ebola 9,
      the virus planet.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Why can't they go today?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Because tonight's a special night and I want all of you to be alive.
      It's the Academy of Inventors annual symposium.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow! I love symposia.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It's the event of the scientific season. Every member presents an invention
      and the best one wins the Academy prize.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Sounds boring.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, my, yes. But not this year, because my latest invention is unbeatable.
      Behold! The death clock.  Simply jam your finger in the hole and this readout
      tells you exactly how long you have left to live.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Does it really work?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well it's occasionally off by a few seconds. What with free will and
      all.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sounds like fun. How long do I have left to live?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ooh! Dibs on his CD player!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, my, yes.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Who's the gross nerd?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That's me at the very first symposium. I'm the Academy's oldest living
      member, you know. These youngsters all look up to me.
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: Well, well, well. Look who decided to show his wrinkled face.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Why don't you just leave me alone, Wernstrom?!
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: Face it, Farnsworth, you're over the hill. It's time to leave science
      to the 120-year-olds.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You young turks think you know everything. I was inventing things when
      you were barely turning senile.
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: Go home before you embarrass yourself, old man. Now, if you'll excuse
      me, I'm going to take a nap before the ceremonies.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Who's that jerk?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: A hundred years ago he was my most promising student at Mars University.
      But then after one fateful pop-quiz...
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: A-minus? No one gives Ogden Wernstrom an A-minus!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I'm sorry but penmanship counts.
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: I swear I'll have my revenge even if it takes me a hundred years.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: 'And here it is: Slightly over 99 years later and still no revenge.
      I''m essentially in the clear.'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I've been perusing your fortified wine list and I've selected the '71
      Hobo's Delight, the '57 Chateau Par-tay and the '66 Thunder Chevitz.
  - character: WAITER
    dialogue: Exquisite choices, sir.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And mix them all together in a big jug.
  - character: POPEIL
    dialogue: "Welcome to this year\x92s Academy of Inventors Annual Symposium, I'm\
      \ your host, Ron Popeil, inventor of Mr. Microphone, the spray-on toupee and\
      \ - of course - the technology to keep human heads alive in jars.  But wait,\
      \ there's more. We've got a whole line-up of inventors tonight, starting with\
      \ that up and coming young star, Ogden Wernstrom."
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) More wine!
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: Distinguished members of the Academy, I present to you, the Reverse
      SCUBA Suit. Observe!  Fetch!  Now, sit!  I said sit!  Bad fish!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Don't worry, Professor, it's no competition for your death clock.
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: And what will you be presenting this evening, grandpa?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Let's just say it'll put you young whippersnappers in your place!
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: I just hope it's not as lame as that death clock you presented last
      year.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Uh, last year, you say?
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: That's right.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, my! Did it put you young whippersnappers in your place?
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: Hardly! We laughed until our teeth fell out. Come along, Cinnamon.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, dear, I'll have to invent something new in the next ten minutes.
      Perhaps some sort of death clock.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, Professor...?
  - character: POPEIL
    dialogue: Our last presentation comes from our oldest member, Professor Hubert
      Farnsworth. Professor?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Just a second, just a second.
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: Pencils down, prune-face.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Uh, yes, here I am, OK, now, hello there. Now, we all know telescopes
      allow us to see distant objects. But what if we want to smell distant objects?
      Well now we can! Thanks to my new invention...the Smellescope.
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: Oh, I say!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: The odour travels past this coffee stain here, around the olive pit
      and into this cigar burn. And this appears to be a, doodle of myself as a cowboy.
      But the Smellescope is brilliant, I tell you! Think of the astronomical odours
      you'll smell thanks to me.  Oh, my!
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: 'I''ve waited a hundred years for this, Farnsworth. I give your invention
      the worst grade imaginable: An A-minus-minus.'
  - character: POPEIL
    dialogue: And now for the presentation of the award. Listen, folks, I'm practically
      giving this prize away to Dr. Wernstrom, for his fish thingy.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a scientist.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yep!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, Professor, don't give up. There were plenty of times in my century
      when I was gonna give up but I never did. Never! Hey, are you even listening
      to me? Oh, I give up!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: By God, you're right! I'm going to build that Smellescope!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Eureka!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Did you build the Smellescope?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No, I remembered that I'd built one last year. Go ahead. Try it. You'll
      find that every heavenly body has its own particular scent. Here, I'll point
      it at Jupiter.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Smells like strawberries.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Exactly! And now Saturn.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Pine needles. Oh, man, this is great! Hey, as long as you don't make
      me smell Uranus.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't get it.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid
      joke once and for all.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh. What's it called now?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Urectum. Here, let me locate it for you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, no, I think I'll just smell around a bit over here!  Hmm.  Hmm.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: What is it?  Oh, jeez! Oh, man! Remarkable! A stench so foul is right
      off the funk-o-meter. I dare say Fry may have discovered the smelliest object
      in the known universe.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ooh, ooh, name it after me!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I think it's moving.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Hmm, perhaps the computer can calculate its trajectory.  My God! Whatever
      it is it's headed straight for us. With enough force to reduce this entire city
      to a stinky crater. We have less than 72 hours.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, lets get looting!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So this thing's gonna destroy the whole city?  What the heck is it?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Ah! Just as I thought. The answer lies in this movie I found on the
      Internet.
  - character: NARRATOR
    dialogue: 'New York City: the year 2000. The most wasteful society in the history
      of the galaxy and it was running out of places to empty its never-ending output
      of garbage.  The landfills were full. New Jersey was full. And so, under cover
      of darkness, the city put its garbage out to sea on the world''s largest barge.
      The repulsive barge circled the oceans for 50 years but no country would accept
      it. Not even that really filthy one. You know the one I mean. Finally, in 2052,
      the city used its mob connections to obtain a rocket and launch the garbage
      into outer space. Some experts claim the ball might return to Earth someday,
      but their concerns were dismissed as "depressing".'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow! You got that off the Internet? In my day the Internet was only
      used to download pornography.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Actually that's still true.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: So that's the situation. Due to the short-sightedness of Old New York,
      New New York is going to be destroyed by a giant ball of garbage.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, what the hell were you people thinking back then? How could you
      just throw your garbage away?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, hey, gimmie a break! What do you do with it?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We recycle everything. Robots are made from old beer cans.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah! And this beer can is made outta old robots.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: And that sandwich you're eating is made of old discarded sandwiches.  Nothing
      just gets thrown away.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: The future is disgusting.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Typical 20th century attitude.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey! You have no right to criticise the 20th century. We gave the world
      the lightbulb, the steamboat and the cotton gin.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Those things are all from the 19th century.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, well, they probably just copied us.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Please! There's no time for this now. This is an emergency. We must
      warn the mayor.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: Garbage ball, huh? That sounds serious.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Very serious, Mayor Poopenmeyer.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: I gotta be sure this isn't another scientific fraud like global warming
      or second-hand smoke.  Send in my science advisor.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Wernstrom!
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: Well, well, well! Come to present your latest napkin, Professor?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No, I'm here because a giant trash ball is heading straight for us.
      Smell for yourself.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: Hey! Holy jeez!
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: That smell could be anything; A faulty stench coil, some cheese on the
      lens, who knows?
  - character: WOMAN
    dialogue: Mr. Mayor, we just got this transmission from Neptune.
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: Giant...garbage ball.....passed close by...horrible stench......
  - character: WOMAN
    dialogue: The transmission cuts out there, sir. No, I, guess it keeps going.
  - character: WOMAN
    dialogue: There we go.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: My God! The senile old man is right.
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: Do you mean him or me?
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: Him!
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: Next, New New York in crisis. Morbo?
  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: Thanks, human female. Puny Earthlings were shocked today to learn that
      a ball of garbage will destroy their pathetic city of New New York.
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: Makes me glad we live here in Los Angeles.
  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: Morbo agrees!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Can't we just shoot a missile at it?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: But suppose we send a crew to plant an explosive precisely on the fault
      line betwen this mass of coffee grounds and this deposit of America Online floppy
      disks.
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: Uh, in theory, perhaps. But you'll never find a crew willing to take
      on a mission so suicidal-y dangerous.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, crap!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Now, you'll only have one chance to destroy the ball. After that, it
      will be so close to Earth that blowing it up would cause garbage to rain over
      the entire planet, killing billions.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (ironic) Oh, boo-hoo!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Now here's the bomb I've prepared. Once you activate it, you'll have
      25 minutes to get away.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's all? But --
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Now, now, there'll be plenty of time to discuss your objections when
      and if you return.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Odour at magnitude 8.  Magnitude 12. Magnitude 31.  We're breaking up.
      Turn on the anti-smell device.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hmm, sporty!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look at all this filth.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's not filth. It's a glorious monument to the achievements of the
      20th century. Look! A real Beanie Baby.  Oh! A Mr. Spock collector's plate!  Some
      Bart Simpson dolls!
  - character: DOLL
    dialogue: Eat my shorts!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: "OK  (\xE0 la Homer Simpson) Mmm! Shorts!"
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, this stuff was garbage when it was new. Let's blow it up already!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This junk isn't garbage! I can dig in any random pile and find something
      great.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (gasping) Alright, let's get to work.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Let's see. If that's Hypodermic Ridge then the bomb must go right here.  Get
      ready to run. We've got 25 minutes. Uh, 15 minutes.  5 minutes.  6h minutes?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: There's your problem. The Professor put the counter on upside-down.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That idiot! It wasn't set for 25 minutes, it was set for 52 seconds.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We're gonna die! (calmly) Right?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Right!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's gonna blow!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey, watch it! You'll put somebody's eye out!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: OK, OK, keep your space pants on. I'll take care of this.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We're saved!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah, but this garbage ball's unstoppable now. New New York is done
      for.
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: All in all, this is one day Mittens the kitten won't soon forget!
  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: Kittens give Morbo gas. In lighter news, the city of New New York is
      doomed. Blame rests with known human Professor Hubert Farnsworth and his tiny,
      inferior brain.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, how could I have put that bomb timer on upside-down? I could swear
      I followed the manual precisely.  I'm a dried up husk of a scientist. This is
      all my fault.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, it's my fault too. I'm sure I threw out more than my share of that
      trash up there. Also, one month my toilet broke and it just went straight in
      the garbage can.  Leela was right. The people of the 20th century were idiotic
      slobs. Especially me.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: Enough! You all failed miserably. It's time to put a real scientist
      in charge.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Wernstrom!
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: The very same.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: Dr. Wernstrom, can you save my city?
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: Of course. But it'll cost you. First I'll need tenure.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: Done.
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: And a big research grant.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: You got it.
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: Also, access to a lab and five graduate students, at least three of
      them Chinese.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: Um, alright done. What's your plan?
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: What plan? I'm set for life! Au revoir, suckers!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That rat! Do something!
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: I wish I could but, he's got tenure!
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: It's time to take action.  Stephanie, cancel the maid for today. Have
      her come tomorrow.  Well, I'm out of ideas. Anyone?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Wait! If we could build an object the exact size, density and consistency
      of the garbage ball, it might just knock the ball away without smashing it to
      bits.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But where can we find a substance the exact density and consistency
      as garbage?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Alas, I don't know.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, what about garbage?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good Lord! A second ball of garbage! That just might work!
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: But garbage isn't something you just find lying in the streets of Manhattan.
      This city's been garbage-free for 500 years!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Then it's time to make some more.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: Make garbage? But how?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Stand back and watch the master! This Slurm can.  Now it's garbage.
      These papers.  Garbage. This picture of your wife.  Pure garbage. Now you try
      it.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: By God, I think the boy's got something. Come on, everyone! The fate
      of the city is at stake!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Good!  Don't finish that cruller, throw it away  Bender. Drink that
      beer and drop the bottle on the ground.  Very nice.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: Get that robot some more beer!  We've trashed this room but that's just
      the start. We've got to get Fry's message to the people.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: People of New New York. Take a lesson from the 20th century. Stop all
      this pain-in-the-ass recycling and throw your garbage on the floor.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Go ahead. Just chuck it any old place like I used to. Your city is counting
      on you.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: If my calculations are correct, this garbage ball will knock the other
      garbage ball directly into the sun.
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: And if my calculations are correct, we're all going to die horribly.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: Alright, places everyone. Prepare for launch.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Five, four, three, two, three, four, five, six...
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Just fire the damn thing.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oops!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Burning garbage!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It worked!
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: And so, on behalf of the entire city, I thank you, Professor Farnsworth.
      I now present you with the Academy prize, which we confiscated from Dr. Wernstrom
      after it became apparent that he was a jackass.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes! In your face, Wernstrom!
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: I'll get you, Farnsworth. Even if it takes me another hundred years.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: And, Fry, we owe you a tremendous debt as well. If not for your 20th
      century garbage-making skills, we'd all be buried under 20th century garbage.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Should we really be celebrating? I mean, what if the second garbage
      ball returns to Earth like the first one did?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Who cares? That won't be for hundreds of years.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Exactly! It's none of our concern.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's the 20th century spirit!

    dialogue: Count me in! I'm gonna drink til I reboot!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.
  - character: FENDER
    dialogue: Don't be a drag, man. We're jacking on!  Aww yeah!  Wanna jolt?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh hey, I'm no square but isn't that counter-indicated by my operations
      manual?
  - character: ROBOT
    dialogue: Counter indicated!
  - character: FENDER
    dialogue: Come on, Bender, grab a jack. I told these guys you were cool.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, if jacking on'll make strangers think I'm cool, I'll do it!
  - character: FENDER
    dialogue: Easy, baby. You don't wanna get hooked on this stuff.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Eh, no need to worry. I don't have an addictive personality.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey uh Bender. What are we doing in this bad neighbourhood?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Shut up, square!  I'll just be a minute!
  - character: PREACHERBOT
    dialogue: Wretched sinner unit! The path to robot heaven lies here......in the
      Good Book 3.0.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey! Do I preach to you when you're lying stoned in the gutter? No!
      So beat it!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Who was that guy?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yo mama! Now shut up and drag me to work!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Our electric bill's climbing faster than a green snake up a sugarcane.
      Obviously someone round been wastin' a whole heap a juice! Probably you!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Me?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Good morning, Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: None of your business, get off my back!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: What's his problem?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: If I didn't know better I'd almost think he was abusing electricity.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender? No way!  I definitely would've noticed something.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, why are you spending so much time in the bathroom? Are you jacking
      on in there?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No! Don't come in!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good news, everyone! Today you'll be delivering a crate of subpoenas
      to Sicily 8, the Mob Planet!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Alright, let's get to work! I'll be out in a second.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I know Big Vinnie said he was giving me the kiss of death but I still
      think he was gay.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Did he use his tongue?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: A little.  You OK, Bender?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: None of your business! Get off my back!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh oh. There seems to be some sort of electrical disturbance in the
      Coalsack Nebula.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: A what kind of disturbance?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Electrical. Anyway it's going to take some careful piloting to avoid
      it.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We're out of control. We're heading straight into the electric field!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's happening? I-I feel weird!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Come on universe you big, mostly empty wuss! Gimmie all the juice you
      got! Oh, mama!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, we didn't mind your drinking, or your kleptomania, or your pornography
      ring.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: In fact, that's why we loved you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But this electricity abuse crossed the line. You almost killed us.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you. Just like when my
      friend Richie swore he wasn't taking drugs and then he sold me my mom's VCR
      and then later I found out he was taking drugs. You make me ashamed to be your
      friend.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You're right. I'm a lost cause.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Maybe there's another way.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, yeah, that's the good stuff.  (crying) What am I doing? What have
      I become? Huh?
  - character: PREACHERBOT
    dialogue: I see a lot of fancy robots here today. Made of real shiny metal. But
      that don't impress the Robot Devil, no, sir!
  - character: ROBOT
    dialogue: No, sir!
  - character: PREACHERBOT
    dialogue: '''Cause if you''re a sinner, he''s gonna plug his infernal modem in
      the wall, belchin'' smoke and flame. Amd he''s gonna download ya straight to
      Robot Hell!'
  - character: ROBOT
    dialogue: Straight to hell!
  - character: PREACHERBOT
    dialogue: 'So I ask ya: Who will stand up and be saved? Who? Who?'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (weakly) Me.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: And as a further cost-cutting measure, I have eliminted the salt-water
      cooler.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: This is a witch hunt!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) Oh, what a beautiful morning, oh what a beautiful day! (talking)
      Greetings, friends. Don't we all look nice today?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Great he's whacked out on electricity again.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No, I'm whacked out on life. My friends, I found religion.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Religon? Is this another scam to get free yarmulkes?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Give him a break, Fry. If this helps Bender clean up his act then I
      think we should be supportive.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh, yeah.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Oh, yes!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Oh, yeah.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wonderful. Then you'll all come to my exceedingly long, un-air-conditioned
      baptism ceremony!
  - character: PREACHERBOT
    dialogue: We are gathered here today to deliver brother Bender from the cold,
      steel grip of the Robot Devil unto the cold, steel bosom of our congregation.
  - character: PREACHERBOT
    dialogue: Brother Bender, do you accept the principles of Robotology on pain of
      eternal damnation in Robot Hell?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes, I do.
  - character: PREACHERBOT
    dialogue: Then I will now baptise you.  Press any key to continue.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, while you're at it, could you touch up this seam?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This is unbelievable. The old Bender never would have taken us out to
      dinner.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: The old Bender's gone. He won't trouble you anymore.
  - character: WAITER
    dialogue: Would monsieur care to see the wine list?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No poison for us, thanks. I'll stick with good old mineral oil.  Ah!
      Functional!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Mon, I'm hungrier than a green snake in a sugar cane field!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'Friends! Friends! Surely you''re not going to eat before we say Robot
      Grace? In the name of all that is good and logical we give thanks for the chemical
      energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerimatic: 1000101010101...'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: '...0010110012. Amen.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Does that mean we can eat now?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes.  But first, since I love you all so much, I'd like to give everyone
      hugs. Come here, Fry!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, uh, but I don't want to.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Mmm! Mmm! Fry, you're my friend!  C'mon, everyone line up for a hug.
      Let's tear down some emotional walls.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What are you doing to my ship?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Sanctifying it!  There! That ought to convert a few tailgaters.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender's stupid religion is driving me nuts.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Amen.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: If only he had joined a mainstream religion like Oprah-ism or Voodoo.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We've got to get the old Bender back.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: And I think I know a way to do it. We have to reacquaint him with a
      little thing called "sleaze".
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I can't believe somebody hired an interstellar spaceship to deliver
      a package to Atlantic City. What are we delivering anyway?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, this.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Where are we delivering it to?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, here.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Another job well done. Now back to the office for an enjoyable evening
      of fasting and repentance.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long as we're here why don't we take
      in some, exotic dancing!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey, great idea!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But, those girls don't wear cases. You can see their bare circuits.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Come on, it'll be fun! Maybe we could even drink a little fortified
      wine.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What?" Drinking wine is a sin. Even if it is deliciously fortified.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey, Bender, looks at that woman's purse. It's hanging by a spaghetti
      strand.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Thou shalt not snatch.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And there's Hookerbot 5000. She's got a heart of solid gold!
  - character: HOOKERBOT
    dialogue: Hey, sailing unit!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Stop tempting me! For once in my life I have inner peace.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Pfft, that's for losers. C'mon, sin your heart out.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Go nuts.
  - character: HOOKERBOT
    dialogue: Live a little.
  - character: WOMAN
    dialogue: Could you hold my purse for a minute?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Go for it, Bender. You know you wanna!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm the greatest.  Woo-hoo!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look's like we got the old Bender back!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You know it, pork pie! Except for one thing.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Y'know, as a major Hollywood director I'll be holding auditions tonight
      for my next movie. And even though you're all young and naive, I think you might
      just have what it takes.  Hey! I'm trying to score here! Can't you read the
      "Do Not Disturb" sign?  No! No!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What in hell happened to Bender?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well he didn't check out. The ashtray's still here.  Look, Nibbler's
      caught the scent of vodka and motor oil! Go, boy. Follow that stench.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm hallucinating this, right?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But I don't belong here. I don't like things that are scary and painful.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aww, hell - I mean heck!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait! I remember this place. They shut it down after all those people
      caught salmonella from the flume ride.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hmm. Look! It's the symbol of Bender's old religion.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Unbelievable. It's an actual, factual Robot Hell.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Who would've thought hell would really exist? And that it would be in
      New Jersey!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Actually --
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aw crap, singing. Mind if I smoke?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) Just tell me why.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) There must be robots worse than I.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) Then please let me explain,
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) Ah, don't blame me blame my upbringing!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (singing) I don't feel well.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (singing) It's up to us to rescue him.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (singing) Maybe he likes it here in hell.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (singing) It's us who tempted him to sin.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (singing) Maybe he's back at the motel.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (singing) Come on, Fry, don't be scared,
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (singing) My ass has blisters from the slide.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender, are you alright?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No! Oh they're tormenting me with up-tempo singing and dancing.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Alright, Beelzebot, what'll it take to get our friend back?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait. What fiddle contest?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds of pounds and sound crummy?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (whispering) Do you know how to play the fiddle?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) No, do you?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (whispering) No, but I used to play the drums. They're sorta similar.
      (talking) What happens if we lose?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We'll do it.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, we're boned.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Time for the drum solo!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Run!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hurry, Bender!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I could if you'd drop the stupid gold violin!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, sorry.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Don't worry, guys, I'll never be too good or too evil again. From now
      on, I'll just be me.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, do you think you could be just little less evil than that.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I don't know. Do you think you could survive a 700ft fall?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Good old Bender! THE END

    dialogue: Yeah. I'm never going to another planet called Cannibalon!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Me neither. (upbeat) Food was good, though.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, great news, everyone.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Shove it! We quit!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: In that case I'll have to hire a new crew to go on our company vacation.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Vacation?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Alright!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This is great! I haven't had time off since I was 21 through 24.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It's just my way of thanking you for not reporting my countless violations
      of safety and minimum wage laws.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aww, you!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I've booked us all on the maiden voyage of the largest, most luxurious
      space cruise ship ever built.  The Titanic!

    dialogue: 'As Mayor of New New York, it''s my pleasure to introduce the honorary
      captain for the Titanic''s maiden voyage. A man who single-handedly defeated
      the Retiree People of the Assisted Living Nebula: Zapp Brannigan!'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, God! Not Zapp Brannigan!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: You know Zapp Brannigan?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Let's just say we've "crossed paths".
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Was that before or after you slept with him?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: She's a beautiful ship alright. Shapely, seductive. I'm gonna fly her
      brains out.  And now, without further adieu, I christen this ship, Titanic.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Well, well, well! The Lady Leela. Take notes, Kif. You're about to witness
      the subtle waltz known as seduction. So, trapped on a ship with me. What say
      you and I knock some very sensual boots?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: "It's tempting, but, uh, I have a fianc\xE9 now. Uh, hmm, uh, hmm, uh,\
      \ we--, uh ...  Him! Fry, darling, meet Zapp Brannigan."
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Huh?  Ooh! How do you do?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Ah, here's my stateroom.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Come on, where is it?  Ohh!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Now, Hermes, you and your lovely wife LaBarbara have the suite through
      there. And Dr. Zoidberg, your marble tank is on the other side.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Man, first class seems nice!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It'll seem even nicer once you've seen your room.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Looks like we're on the Fiesta Deck.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This is it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well at least we get a window!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, I'm tired of this room and everyone in it. If you'll excuse me,
      I'm gonna pop over to the casino for the next 135 hours!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I think I'll go and fill up on bisque at the buffet.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: "I guess that just leaves you and your fake fianc\xE9 ... all alone\
      \ ... on a romatic cruise."
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Take it off or I'll break it off.
  - character: FRY

  - character: CROUPIER
    dialogue: Snake eyes.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No! My cheating unit malfunctioned! You gotta give me a do-over!
  - character: CROUPIER

    dialogue: You got it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bender.
  - character: COUNTESS
    dialogue: Charmed. I'm the Countess de la Roca. I was surprised to see another
      robot staying in first class. Most of the robots I meet are labourers.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I assure you, I barely know the meaning of the word "labour".
  - character: COUNTESS
    dialogue: Oh, Mr. Bender!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Please, call me Bender.
  - character: COUNTESS
    dialogue: (embarrassed) Oh, goodness. I don't--
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Kif, I'm feeling the captain's itch.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: I'll get the powder, sir.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: No, the itch for adventure! Prepare to change course.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Sir, this is a leisure cruise. Our path was set by the travel agency.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: That's for schoolgirls! Now here's a route with some chest hair.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: But that course leads directly through a swarm of comets.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: "Yes, comets! The icebergs of the sky. By jackknifing from one to the\
      \ next at breakneck speed we might just get some kind of gravity boost ... or\
      \ something. It's time to shove a jalape\xF1o up this ship's tailpipe.  Divert\

  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?

    dialogue: Uh ...
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, our accommodations aren't great but it sure is beautiful our here.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, it's pretty romantic-- Uh, I mean platonic. Th-That sure is one
      platonic view!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: "Fry, just be quiet. I'm beginning to think this whole fake fianc\xE9\
      \ thing was a terrible, terrible--"
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hmm? Mmmm!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Leela, perhaps this is an awkward time but if things don't work out
      with this pipsqueak here ...  ... I just want you to know I'll be there to score
      you on the rebound.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, look, before you get any crazy ideas, that was for Zapp.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, you got anything else for him?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Alright, can we try not to complicate this?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Mom, Dad. I'd like you to meet Fry, my boyfriend.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hmm? Mmmm!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: See you later, wuvvums!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It would have been nice if you'd told me you were going out with Amy.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm not going out with Amy. It's just to fool her parents. Hey, you're
      not jealous, are you?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What? No. No! Of course not!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Good, 'cause I consider my fake relationship with you a lot more meaningful.
  - character: COUNTESS
    dialogue: Mind if I freshen up a bit before we go out?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I was just about to suggest the same thing.  Pay dirt!
  - character: COUNTESS
    dialogue: Lovely, isn't it?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah. But only 93% as lovely as you.
  - character: COUNTESS
    dialogue: Oh, Bender! Either that was a computing error or you're the most romantic
      robot I've ever met!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'I don''t get it, iZac: That bracelet had a diamond the size of a racoon''s
      brain. Why couldn''t I steal it?'
  - character: IZAC
    dialogue: It's obvious, Mr. B, you're in love.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, it's true. But we're star-crossed robots. She, a countess built
      with a silver spoon in her mouth. And me, just a regular honest Joe.
  - character: IZAC
    dialogue: Hey, you gonna pay for those?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hell, no!
  - character: IZAC
    dialogue: Security to bar area. Security to bar area.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fellas, please. I'm in love!
  - character: IZAC
    dialogue: Rough him up!
  - character: COUNTESS
    dialogue: What are you doing?
  - character: IZAC
    dialogue: This penniless chump was stealing drinks, ma'am.
  - character: COUNTESS
    dialogue: I see. Here you are, sir ...  ... keep the change.

  - character: ANNOUNCER
    dialogue: 'Now limboing for the Earth team: Hermes Conrad.'
  - character: BOY
    dialogue: (shouting) You're my hero, Hermes! I'm gonna be just like you!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: No, boy, stop! It's too low! Your backbone can't take it!

    dialogue: (screaming) Nooo!
  - character: LABARBARA
    dialogue: There, there. Now you don't have to limbo if you don't want. It doesn't
      make you any less of a man.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Though it did get me some action!
  - character: HATTIE
    dialogue: I like a man who's flexible!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Your attention, please. As captain of this vessel, the terrible burden
      of naming a limbo contest winner is mine and mine alone.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Shouldn't you be steering between the comets?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: And the winner is, Leela!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But I didn't even limbo.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: No matter. I know from personal experience how horizontal you can get.
      As your reward, you and that hairpile are invited to dine at the captain's table
      this evening.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, now you know. I'm not actually rich. I'm a fraud. A poor, lazy,
      sexy fraud. This isn't even a real bow-tie -- it's magnetic.
  - character: COUNTESS
    dialogue: Bender, I don't care whether you have money. I love you for your artificial
      intelligence and your sincerity simulator.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You do? Really?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I like your style, Fry. You remind me of a young me. Not much younger,
      mind you. Perhaps even a couple of years older.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Thank you, sir.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: As a gentleman, I must warn you. If you so much as glance at another
      woman, I'll be all over Leela like a fly on a pile of very seductive manure.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, rest assured, Leela's the only girl for me.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hey, Fry.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Amy!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Leela!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Ah, the family Wong. Our party is complete.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (whispering) What are we gonna do? Fry can't pretend to be both our
      boyfriends.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) Sure I can. I learned how to handle delicate social situations
      from a little show called Three's Company.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I'd like to impose a toast on the happy couple. Down the hatch!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Yes, Fry. Plant one on your woman.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Um, let me think. Come and knock on our door, nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh.
      Uh, Mr Roper--
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Wait, I'm confused. Now tell me, Fry, which one of these ladies are
      you involved with?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh ...
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Captain, may I have a word with you?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: No.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: It's an emergency, sir.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Come back when it's a catasrophe.  Oh, very well.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Well, with Zapp gone and my parents still here, I suggest Fry give me
      a nice, convincing kiss.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ah, now there's something we can all enjoy.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Sir, remember your course correction?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: No.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Well it's proving somewhat more suicidal than we'd initially hoped.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: 'Kif, old friend, I don''t know which disgusts me more: Your cowardice
      or your stupidity! We''ll simply set a new course for that empty region over
      there. Near that black-ish hole-ish thing.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, Leela, why'd you run off from dinner?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I didn't run off. I had plenty of time to finish eating and stroll away
      while you were kissing Amy.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, look, I'm not actually interested in her if that's what's bothering
      you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two eyes, you have two eyes.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I know, we seem like a perfect match, but I just don't feel that way
      about her.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Nice nebula.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look's like everybody's got somebody. Except me.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And me.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What was that?  Oh, my God! We're heading straight into a black hole.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Talk about a mood killer!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Don't blame yourself, Kif. We were doomed from the start. Nothing remains
      now but for the captain to go down with his ship.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Why, that's surprisingly noble of you, sir.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: No, it's noble of you, Kif!  As of now ...  ... you're in command. Congratulations,
      captain!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK. We just have to get from here to the escape pods.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (shouting) I'm too young to die!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Come on, before its too late!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You all go without me. I'm gonna take one last look around. You know,
      for, uh, stuff to steal.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You're going back or the Countess, aren't you?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (whispering) Alright, I am. But I don't want the others to know. If
      I don't come back, just say I died robbing some old man.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'll tell them you went out prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead
      finger.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I love you, buddy!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Countess? Countess?
  - character: COUNTESS
    dialogue: (shouting) I fell through the deck.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Are you hurt, my sweet?
  - character: COUNTESS
    dialogue: (shouting) No. Luckily a family broke my fall.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Just hang on! I'll take care of that fire!
  - character: COUNTESS
    dialogue: Bender, you risked your life to save me.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third time. But that would be it.  When
      we kiss, I feel like I'm standing waist deep in a pool of cold, rising water.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hurry! The escape pods should be just ahead!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: (gasping) Faster!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It won't move. And the door release is on the other side.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Then we're dead meat. No one could squeeze under there!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: No one, except a legendary limbo champion.
  - character: LABARBARA
    dialogue: Oh, Hermes!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Ooh! It's been a while.  This one is for that little kid who's limboing
      up in heaven right now.
  - character: LABARBARA
    dialogue: That's my man, alright, baby, limbo!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: I still got the moves! Zoidberg, lower the door another inch.
  - character: LABARBARA
    dialogue: Just go on through and hit the release, you hot dog!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Yes, dear.
  - character: LABARBARA
    dialogue: That's my man!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Yay, Hermes!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Uh, can somebody help me up?
  - character: COUNTESS
    dialogue: Well, now what are we going to do?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wait a second. Aren't you a member of the yacht club?
  - character: COUNTESS
    dialogue: By God, you're right! I'm a class-3 yacht.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Thank God there are plenty of escape pods; We won't have to dress up
      like women and children.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We can't leave yet. We've got to wait for Bender. The high gravity must
      be slowing down his looting.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Mom? Dad? You're alive!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Uh, Mom, I don't--  Hi!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: (sexfully) Hello!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I don't feel well!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see it I'll think back to that moment
      when we almost--  Never mind!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Everyone else is off the ship. Where in Babylon is Bender?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't know. But we can't wait any longer.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Goodbye, Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Wait for us!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Something's wrong. We're two metric tons overweight.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Well, its not me!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look!
  - character: COUNTESS
    dialogue: I'm slipping, Bender. The pull is too strong!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I can't live without you. If you let go, I let go!
  - character: COUNTESS
    dialogue: No! You have too much to live for. It may hurt for a while but one day
      you'll share your love again. After all, it's shareware.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Don't talk like that. Tragic romances always have a happy ending.
  - character: COUNTESS
    dialogue: (shouting) Farewell!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Nooo!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: She's gone.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But she saved all our lives. Without her, we're light enough to get
      away.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows what happens in a black hole.
      It's possible she's still alive in another dimension somewhere. Right, Professor?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, yes, absolutely!  Not a chance!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: At least I'll always have her bracelet! What do you think it's worth?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: It's fake, mon!

  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good news, everyone.  We've got a very special delivery today.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Who's it going to?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Me.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Another job well done.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No, I need it shipped to my office at Mars University.  It's a little
      experiment that may well win me the Nobel Prize.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: In what field?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I don't care, they all pay the same.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Is it dangerous?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, my, no.  Off we go!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Very impressive. Back in the 20th century we had no idea there was a
      university on Mars.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well, in those days Mars was just a dreary, uninhabitable wasteland,
      uh, much like Utah. But unlike Utah, it was eventually made livable, when the
      university was founded in 2636.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'They planted traditional college foliage: ivy, trees, hemp. Soon the
      whole planet was terraformed.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Does that mean it's safe to breathe the air?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Of course.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Over here is Wong Library. It has the largest collection of literature
      in the Western universe.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey look. There's a chapter of my old robot fraternity; Epsilon Rho
      Rho.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You went to college?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Of course, I'm a bender. I went to Bending College. I majored in Bending.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What was your minor?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Robo-American Studies.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, no, actually I'm an Epsilon from way back.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Thanks. Here's your finger back.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: All the coolest robots are in this fraternity.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh-oh, nerds!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You're all losers. My name's Bender.
  - character: OILY
    dialogue: Bender from Bending State Bender? Wow, you're a legend around here!
  - character: FATBOT
    dialogue: I heard that in one single night you drank a whole keg, streaked across
      campus and crammed 58 humans into a phone booth.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (modest) Yeah, well, a lot of 'em were children. Anyway I should get
      going.
  - character: GEARSHIFT
    dialogue: No, Bender, wait. We're the lamest frat on campus. Even Hillel has better
      parties than us. Please, you've gotta stay and teach us how to be cool.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hmm, OK. But I'll need 10 kegs of beer, a continuous tape of Louie Louie
      and a regulation two-storey panty-raid ladder.
  - character: FATBOT
    dialogue: Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I tell you, being here really takes me back to my college days.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Good old Coney Island College! Go Whitefish!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but you don't seem like the educated
      type.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, yeah?  Read it and weep. I'm a certified college dropout.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Please! Everyone knows 20th century colleges were basically expensive
      daycare centres.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That's true. By current academic standards, you're merely a high school
      dropout.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What?! That's not fair. I deserve the same respect any other college
      dropout gets. By God, I'm gonna enroll here at Mars University and drop out
      all over again!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You won't last two weeks.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aww, thanks for believing in me.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Yo, classmate. What you takin'?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, I don't know.  Hey, Professor, what are you teaching this semester?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: 'Same thing I teach every semester: The mathematics of quantum neutrino
      fields. I made up the title so that no student would dare take it.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Mathematics of wanton burrito meals. I'll be there!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Please, Fry, I don't know how to teach; I'm a professor!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: See you in class!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh!
  - character: FATBOT
    dialogue: This is gonna be great!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Bingo!
  - character: FATBOT
    dialogue: Oh, mama!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, yeah! Someone's been a bad computer! Get a load of that!
  - character: MEIDERNEYER
    dialogue: I say, you've damaged our servants' quarters ... and our servants.
  - character: CHET
    dialogue: This time Robot House has gone too far.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Cheese it!
  - character: FATBOT
    dialogue: (screaming) They're gonna catch us!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, pretty nice for a single. Two desks, two chairs, a couple of beds.  A
      woodpecker.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I think that's probably your roommate.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, right, cool. (shouting) C'mon in, roomie!  (talking) What the--?
  - character: MONKEY
    dialogue: I call top bunk!  Ahh!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: My roommate's a monkey?
  - character: MONKEY
    dialogue: (sarcastic) Brilliant deduction, you're a credit to your species.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Ah, Fry, I see you've met Guenter!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You know each other?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Guenter is my experiment. He was the top secret contents of this stinking
      crate.
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: I'd rather live in a crate than share a room with this dork.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So what makes Guenter talk?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Is he genetically engineered?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, please! That's preposterous science-fiction mumbo-jumbo. Guenter's
      intelligence actually lies in his electronium hat which harnesses the power
      of sunspots to produce cognitive radiation.
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: You're wasting your breath, Professor. He'll never understand a word
      of it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I understood the word "hat"!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: 'Please, stop bickering. I arranged that you be roommates for a reason:
      So I''d only have to remember one phone number. Now shake hands and make up.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You want a banana?
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: I don't eat bananas. I prefer banana-flavoured energy bars made from
      tofu.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't like you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This is gonna be a cakewalk!
  - character: TEACHER
    dialogue: Welcome to the history of the 20th century. Look to your left, then
      to your right. Then in nine other directions. One of the 12 of you will not
      pass this class.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Boring.  Let's hear about Walter Mondale already!
  - character: TEACHER
    dialogue: 'Be forewarned: The only sure way to get an A in this class is to have
      lived in the 20th century.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Swish!
  - character: TEACHER
    dialogue: You were saying, Mr. Fry?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm from the 20th century. Go ahead, ask me anything.
  - character: TEACHER
    dialogue: Very well. What device invented in the 20th century allowed people to
      view broadcast programmes in their own homes?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ooh ... I know this ... whatyya call it? Lite Brite!
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: I believe the answer is the television.
  - character: TEACHER
    dialogue: Very good Mr ...  ... Guenter.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: (impressed) Wow! Smart and cute!
  - character: VERNON
    dialogue: What I love about being dean of students is the peace and quiet and
      the respect I receive.  Now what's all this about?
  - character: WOMAN
    dialogue: Dean Vernon, the students from Robot House are here.
  - character: VERNON
    dialogue: Robot House!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, dean, nice looking model.
  - character: VERNON
    dialogue: You keep away from it. You robots are a disgrace to this university.
      Whenever a fire alarm is pulled, it's Robot House. Whenever the campus liquor
      store is looted, Robot House. Whenever a human corpse is desecrated--
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Now, I can explain that.
  - character: VERNON
    dialogue: That's enough out of you. From this day forth, Robot House is on dodecatupple-secret
      probation!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No fair!
  - character: FATBOT
    dialogue: My mom is gonna kill me!
  - character: VERNON
    dialogue: 'Now if you''ll excuse me, I have to get back to the one thing that''s
      kept me sane these past eight years: My model ship.'
  - character: GEARSHIFT
    dialogue: Fatbot! No!
  - character: FATBOT
    dialogue: When I get nervous I get hungry.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Cheese it!
  - character: VERNON
    dialogue: (shouting; from inside) Robot House!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So, Chrissy, we seem to be hitting it off. If you're not doing anything
      later might I escort you to a kegger?
  - character: CHRISSY
    dialogue: Not even if you were the last man on Mars.
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: (shouting) Hey! You like bananas?
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: (shouting; from outside) I got her number. How do you like them bananas?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: And therefore, by process of elimination, the electron must taste like
      grapeade.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sorry, I overslept.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Until 5pm?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's that obnoxious monkey. He kept me up all night with his constant
      thinking. Just thinking and thinking. He's trying to make me look like an idiot.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Don't be jealous. Without his special hat, Guenter might be no more
      intelligent than you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I hate that rodent!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Fry, that monkey is my most important experiment. If you two don't stop
      fighting I'll have you both neutered.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That'll show him.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Dean Vernon, I'd like you to meet my parents, Leo and Inez.
  - character: VERNON
    dialogue: Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Wong, I'm so glad we could admit Amy in exchange for
      your generous contribution.
  - character: VERNON
    dialogue: How much you got?
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: Sorry I'm late, I was off at a study session ... with Chrissy!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, I'm glad you made it, Guenter because in honour of parents weekend
      I have a special surprise for you.
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: (horrified) Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?  This is so humiliating.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Now these monkeys I like!  What's that? You wanna come out?
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: No! Stop!
  - character: CHET
    dialogue: I say.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: What's that they're flinging at us?
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: Oh, dear Lord, all over the dean!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, uh, Guenter? Why don't you get up on the chandelier with your parents
      and I'll take a picture?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, looks like the party's winding down. Let's take a road trip to
      Tijuana and get Fatbot some action.
  - character: FATBOT
    dialogue: It's my first time, I'm really nervous.
  - character: VERNON
    dialogue: (shouting) Robot House!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What you did to Guenter was cruel. At the risk of sounding like an after-school
      special, I think we learned who the real animal was today.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You mean peer pressure?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look out! He's got a gun!
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: (crying) Leave me alone.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey, what's going on? I thought you didn't like bananas.
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: (crying) Of course I do. I try so hard to fit in but seeing my parents
      act like that made me realise I'm just a primative beast.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, hey, cheer up. Not everyone turns out like their parents. I mean,
      look at me. My folks were honest hardworking people.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Besides, Guenter, you're not like other monkeys. You've got the hat.
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: (crying) So what? I mean, sure, it looks cool and it makes me smart
      but it doesn't make me happy.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's so sad. I didn't even know monkeys could cry.
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: (crying) They can't. It's all the hat.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look, Guenter, if you're so miserable here, maybe you should just go
      back to the jungle.
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: The jungle. But I couldn't do that to the Professor. I'm his prize experiment,
      and he's like a father to me.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But he's not your father. That guy in the punch bowl was your father.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Look at him, I'm so proud.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Thanks, Professor!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Not you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (screaming) Ow!
  - character: STUDENT
    dialogue: Hey!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why? Why? Why didn't
      I break his legs?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (crying) Oh, poor Guenter.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So he just ran away in the middle of the exam?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I'm afraid so. All he handed in was a paper smeared with faeces. He
      tied with Fry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I guess he realised I was right when I told him to go back to the jungle.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You what? After I spent months slaving over a hot monkey brain?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, don't blame me. You tried to force Guenter to be a human but he's
      an animal. He belongs in the wild. Or in the circus on one of those tiny tricycles.
      Now that's entertainment.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: But Guenter's obviously better off being intelligent. Tell him, Leela.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'Nuh-uh, I''m staying out of this. Now here''s my opinion: What we should
      do is...'
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: What?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I said we'll go to the jungle and let Guenter decide once and for all.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: What?
  - character: VERNON
    dialogue: You all know the rules. Whichever house wins the regatta becomes head
      of the Greek Council. And should that house currently be on any type of multiple
      secret probation, it will be lifted and I will be forced to serve as Grand Marshal
      of a parade honouring them.
  - character: CHET
    dialogue: I say, Robot House, your water craft is as ill-designed as you yourselves.
  - character: MEIDERNEYER
    dialogue: Good one, Chet!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, yeah? Watch this!
  - character: CHET
    dialogue: Well, I never!
  - character: VERNON
    dialogue: Fraternities, on your marks.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow" The jungles on Mars look just like the jungles on Earth.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Jungles? On Earth?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I see some movement up there. I think it's him.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Stand back.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oops.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Don't worry. They'll be fine once the tranquiliser wears off.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: There's our man!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Professor, you'll offer Guenter the hat and, Fry, you'll offer him the
      banana. We'll let him choose whether he wants to be intelligent or just a mindless
      animal.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Come on, Guenter, take the hat.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, the banana, the banana!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Consider the philosophical and metaphysical ramifications of the--
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Banana, banana, banana!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait, what's that sound?
  - character: GEARSHIFT
    dialogue: (shouting) Hey, Bender, you sure this is a short-cut?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Not as sure as I was an hour ago!
  - character: VERNON
    dialogue: And the winner is ...  ... Robot House?!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, dear Lord!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No! No!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Thank God this log is sturdy.  (shouting) Put on the hat, Guenter! You're
      the only one who can save us!  (muttering) Stupid monkey.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Not there.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Keep trying.
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: Eureka! The hat goes on the head. It's all so obvious now!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) Help us, Guenter!
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: Oh, my goodness. (shouting) Hang on. I need to do some calculations.  Got
      it!  Grab on!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: We're saved!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: '''Preciate it Guenter!'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, no! Hurry, Guenter, climb up the vine. You can still save yourself.
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: Why bother? I've got nothing to live for. I was miserable as a genius,
      and as a monkey, I was so dumb I tried to wear a hat on my butt.  (sadly) There's
      just no place for me in this world. (normal) Although, on the other hand--
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, that poor, sweet monkey. Well lets go gather him up. There's no
      sense letting him go to waste.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Guenter! You're alive!
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: I guess the hat must have broke my fall.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It seems to be working at only half-capacity, but I can fix it.
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: No, wait! I like it like this. I actually feel sort of happy.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: But what about your super-intelligence?
  - character: GUENTER
    dialogue: When I had that there was too much pressure to use it. All I want out
      of life is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit. That's
      why I've decided to transfer to business school!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (screaming) Nooo!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Come on, everyone! Big party in Robot House!

    dialogue: Pizza delivery! Wow, so this is a real TV station, huh?
  - character: TECHNICIAN
    dialogue: Well, it's a Fox affiliate.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What are you showing right now?
  - character: TECHNICIAN
    dialogue: Single Female Lawyer. It's the season finale. Wanna watch?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ah, I dunno. That's a chick show. I prefer programmes of the genre "world's
      blankiest blank".
  - character: TECHNICIAN
    dialogue: She is wearing the world's shortiest skirt.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm in!
  - character: JUDGE
    dialogue: Counselor, I remind you that it's unethical to sleep with your client.
      If you really care about the outcome of the case, you should sleep with me.
  - character: JUDGE
    dialogue: Overruled, counselor!
  - character: STENOGRAPHER
    dialogue: Could you repeat that last part?
  - character: TECHNICIAN
    dialogue: Oh, my God! You've knocked Fox of the air!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Pfft! Like anyone on Earth cares.
  - character: STENOGRAPHER
    dialogue: Could you repeat that last par--
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: This is an outrage! I demand to know what happened to the plucky lawyer
      and her compellingly short garment.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: What in the name of Bob Marley's ghost? Get to work, you lazy boat bag!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ow! Hey, quit it, Hermes. It's Labor Day.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Labor Day? That phoney-baloney holiday crammed down our throats by fat-cat
      union gangsters?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's the one.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Hot damn, a day off!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Who's up for one last summer beach trip?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aw, yeah!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Ready Freddy!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (unenthusiastic) Eh, I think I'll just stay here.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, you're wasting your life sitting in front of that TV. You need
      to get out and see the real world.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But this is HDTV. It's got better resolution than the real world!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Everyone's too polite to say anything but you're covered with bed sores.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Not covered!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Just get in the car.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: 'Ah, here we are: Monument Beach!'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait, Mount Rushmore and the Leaning Tower of Pisa? I didn't know they
      were both in New York!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: They are now. In the 2600's New Yorkers elected a super-villain governor,
      and he stole most of the world's monuments.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Truly a great man. Look at him up there.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Aha!  Found you!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: OK, now you go hide.  Nice knowin' you.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Come on, Zoidberg, I passed it right to you.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I've had it with this game! I'm going for a scuttle!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: OK, everyone, come and get it!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ah, just like my dad used to make ... until McDonald's fired him.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Bite my red-hot glowing ass.  Wait a minute. Red-hot glowing ass?  (calmly)
      I'll be right back!  Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!  Aw, yeah!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: No, Nibbler!  (whispering) Psst, Professor, I need another bikini.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Eh ... wha?  Oh, oh, OK, I think there's one can left.  Oh, my.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: There. How do I look?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Like a cheap French harlot.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: French?!
  - character: BULLY
    dialogue: Say, doll-face, how'd you like to make time with a real man?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No. I'm not attracted to bullies. No matter how big and ...  ... handsome
      they are.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's OK, Leela, go ahead. I got a lot of work to do.
  - character: BULLY
    dialogue: Uh, sir, you don't understand. I'm a professional beach bully. I pretend
      to steal your girl, you punch me, I go down, she swoons, you slip me 50 bucks.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 50 bucks?! Not even if she was my girlfriend. You take her.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry! Although I suppose we could go for a walk along the beach.
  - character: BULLY
    dialogue: Uh, no thanks, ma'am, I'm actually gay.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Uh-oh.  Help! Help!  Bender, you gotta spring me. I'll never survive
      in here; I'm too pretty!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Alright, alright, I'll bust you out. Cheese it!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Voila. The greatest sandcastle ever built. This is the kind of castle
      King Arthur would have lived in -- If he were a fiddler crab.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's very nice. We should get a picture before the tide comes in.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ooh, yeah. Anyone have a camera?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Right here, buddy.  Wait, I wanna be in the picture too.  Pretend you're
      happy.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Yay!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, my God!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: What in Babylon?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (screaming) Nooo!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Faster!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We're all gonna die, aren't we?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, I should think so. Although last time aliens invaded all they did
      was force the most intelligent of us to pair off and mate continuously. (chuffed)
      Oh, yes!
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: Once again, today's winning lotto number was 4. In other news, alien
      saucers continue to rain destruction upon Earth. We now go live to an emergency
      address by Earth President McNeal.
  - character: MCNEAL
    dialogue: Ladies and gentlemen, our course is clear. The time has come to knuckle
      under. To get down on all fours and really lick boot. Give our alien masters
      whatever they want a--
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: 'People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.  Is this
      thing on? Now then: We want the one you call "McNeal". Give us McNeal or we
      will lay waste to your cities with our anti-monument laser. We demand McNeal!'
  - character: MCNEAL
    dialogue: Uh, as I was saying ...  ... mankind would sooner perish than kowtow
      to outrageous alien demands for this McNeal ... whoever he is. Am I right?  And
      now, the man who will lead us in our proud struggle for freedom, fresh from
      his bloody triumph over the pacifists of the Gandhi Nebula, 25-star General
      Zapp Brannigan!
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: Yeah!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, look, Leela, it's that idiotic windbag you slept with.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: The Earth is under attack. Can't we just forget about that?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Evidently not.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Call me cocky, but if there's an alien out there I can't kill, I haven't
      met him and killed him yet. But I can't go it alone.  That's why I'm ordering
      every available ship to report for duty. Anyone without a ship should secure
      a weapon and fire wildly into the air.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'Well, you heard the windbag: We''ve been drafted. Everyone into the
      ship.'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. I refuse to fight. I'm a conscientious
      objector.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: A what?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You know, a coward.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Since this is an emergency all robots will now have their patriotism
      circuits activated.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It is every robot's duty to give his life for the good of humanity.  Oh,
      crap!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: We're all from different cultures here. Some of you are white, some
      of you are black.  You're brown.  And you're silver. But I don't care if your
      skin's red or tan or Chinese. You're all going to have to learn to die together.  Am
      I right, soldier?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well actually I--  Sir, yes sir! Sir!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: 'Remember, our mission is simple: Destroy all aliens!'
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Um, uh, not me, sir.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Oh, yes, right. Nobody destroy Kif ... (quietly) unless you have to.  (talking)
      Oh ho ho! The luscious Captain Leela. This is turning into one very sex-ay struggle
      for the future of the human race!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thanks, but I'm not technically human.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Right, right. Nobody destroy Leela either.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well-made bed. You
      will practise until you can make your bed in your sleep.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You mean while I'm sleeping in it?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: You won't have time for sleeping, soldier. Not with all the bed-making
      you'll be doing.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye the
      rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.  Now, like
      all great plans, my strategy is so simple an idiot could have devised it. On
      my command all ships will line up and file directly into the alien death cannons,
      clogging them with wreckage.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: W-Wouldn't it make more sense to send the robots in first a--
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Sir, I volunteer for a suicide mission. Aw, cut it out!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: You're a brave robot, son. But when I'm in command every mission's a
      suicide mission. Which reminds me.  Leela, perhaps before we head into battle
      you'd like to make love to me, in case one of us doesn't come back.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Maybe we should wait 'til afterwards, in case neither of us comes back.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Here's hoping.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm gonna be a science-fiction hero, just like Uhura, or Captain Janeway,
      or Xena!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, this isn't TV, it's real life. Can't you tell the difference?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sure, I just like TV better.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, damage report.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: The auxiliary power's out, and they spilled my cocktail.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Alright, scumwads. This one's for Bender's cocktail!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We did it! We won!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (sadly) Yeah, but it'll never bring back my martini.  (normal) Well,
      who wants a martini?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Good work, everyone. The mothership is destroyed.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: What the hell is that thing?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: It appears to be the mothership.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Then what did we just blow up?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: The Hubble Telescope.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: (shouting) Stop exploding, you cowards!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This is hopeless.  If we're gonna get blown to bits, we might as well
      do it in the comfort of our own home.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You'll be the captain, you'll be the delivery boy, and you'll be the
      alcoholic, foul-mouthed--  Oh, God, you're alive. I mean, thank God you're alive!  Sorry,
      check back in three days, a week at the most.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: We want McNeal! Stop stalling!
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: And now a rebuttal from President McNeal.
  - character: MCNEAL
    dialogue: The people of Earth remain united in my refusal to hand over myself.
      Total annihalation is a small price to pay compared with--
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: (shouting) Here he is! Come and get him!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: You are not McNeal.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: (simultaneously) Huh?
  - character: MCNEAL
    dialogue: (simultaneously) Huh?
  - character: MCNEAL
    dialogue: Oh, thank you. Thank you, glorious masters! I--
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Give us McNeal!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: That was McNeal.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: She wears miniskirts and is promiscuous.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: (sexfully) Really?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Miniskirts? That sounds familiar.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Surely you know McNeal. She is an unmarried human female struggling
      to succeed in a human male's world.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Maybe that's just her excuse for being incompetent.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: (shouting) Silence! (talking) We will accept no more decoys.  This is
      the McNeal.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait, I know her.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You do not, you big fat liar. You don't know anyone. All you do is watch
      TV.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's where I know her from. She's Jenny McNeal. She was a character
      on a TV show back in the 20th century, Single Female Lawyer.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well if they're hoping to see a TV show that hasn't existed for a thousand
      years, pfft, they are royally boned.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: We will raise your planet's temperature by one million degrees a day,
      for five days, unless we see McNeal at 9pm tomorrow -- 8 central!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (disappointed) I'm beginning to think there'll be no forced mating at
      all.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: They're going to destroy the entire Earth if they don't see some stupid
      TV show about some bimbo lawyer?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's crazy! How could they even know about a show from a thousand years
      ago?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well, Omicron Persei 8 is about a thousand light years away. So the
      electro-magnetic waves would just recently have gotten there. You see--
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Magic. Got it.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: 'Check this out: Back in 1999 the season finale of Single Female Lawyer
      was interrupted by technical problems. Apparently some zidiot spilled Coke on
      the transmitter.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Beer -- I would think.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: They must just wanna see that episode. Let's find a tape and give it
      to 'em.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: There aren't any copies left.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No, there wouldn't be. Most videotapes from that era were damaged in
      2443 during the Second Coming of Jesus.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Y'know, I saw the first 30 seconds of that episode. If I could make
      up an ending, maybe we could act it out ourselves.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I could make the costumes.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I have an old five-megawatt broadcasting tower in the attic.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (dramatically) And I, I could be an acting coach!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Let's put on a show.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: OK, Leela, you'll be starring as Jenny--
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'Uh-uh, forget it. A: I''m camera shy, and B: I get tongue tied in front
      of an audience armed with death rays.'
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Plus, you don't really have the thighs for a miniskirt.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Gimme the script.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Places, everyone.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: OK ... all set!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Lights!  Camera one!  Camera two!  Camera three!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Prepare the water cooler, that we may gather around it later and discuss
      things.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) ...And being self-reliant.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Uh, (reading) Jenny McNeal, you are charged with jury-tampering in last
      week's case ...  ... on account of your hot, naked affair with the foreman.
      How do you plead?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Your Honour, I move for a mistrial, on the grounds that I'm also having
      a hot, naked affair with the foreman of this jury.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: (sexfully) I'll see you during the recess!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: If McNeal wishes to be taken seriously why does she not simply tear
      the judge's head off?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (reading) Your witness, Prosecutor Ramirez.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Gracias.  Single Female Lawyer, where were you on the night of August
      23rd?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Sleeping with you.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Aha!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, g-- uh, getting back to the, uh, matter, uh-uh, if it please the
      court ... (whispering) Fry, there's nothing else here. You only wrote two pages
      of dialogue.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, it took an hour to write. I thought it would take an hour to read.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What are we supposed to do now?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't know, I don't know. Just say anything. As long as it's compelling,
      mesmerising, a tour de force.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh...
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (reading) What say you, Single Female Lawyer?

    dialogue: I say ... I'm giving up the law.  And I'm giving up being single. Your
      Honour, will you marry me?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, no! Go to commercial!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: We'll be back after this word from Crazy Bender's Discount Stereo.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Married? Jenny can't get married.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Why not? It's clever, it's unexpected.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But that's not why people watch TV. Clever things make people feel stupid,
      and unexpected things make them feel scared.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You see? TV audiences don't want anything original. They wanna see the
      same thing they've seen a thousand times before.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: "(\xE0 la Arnold Jackson) Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Fry?"
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Trust me on this. While other people were out living their lives, I
      wasted mine watching TV, because deep down I knew it might one day help me save
      the world. Plus, I would have lost my Workman's Comp if I hadd gone outside.
      Now just read these cue cards.

    dialogue: (reading) Miss McNeal, I'm afraid I must decline your offer of marriage.

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You did it, Fry!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yep.  It was just a matter of knowing the secret of all TV shows; At

    dialogue: Hey, dudes, you can win a chance to party with me, Slurms MacKenzie,
      at the Slurm bottling plant on planet Wormulon!
  - character: BABE
    dialogue: I won!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I like those odds.  Rats. Just another tooth.  Aah!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I gotta find that golden bottle-cap.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I've never seen anyone so addicted to Slurm.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This is nothing. Back in high school I used to drink a hundred cans
      of cola a week. Right up until my third heart attack.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, what's wrong?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm sick.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You poor baby. Let me check if you have a fever.  Ow!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: According to Bender's temperature gauge, which I suggest you use next
      time, Leela, he's running a fever of ... 900 degrees.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Bender, mon, lie yourself down.  You're payin' for that!

    dialogue: Really? I though you were the robot.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Nope. Human.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Alright, alright, spare me your life story.  Now what seems to be the
      trouble?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: My tummy hurts and I've been having this burning electrical discharge.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: 'Hmm. Don''t worry, you''ll be fine.  (muttering) Oh boy. (quietly)
      I didn''t have the heart to tell him: It''s fin fungus. He''ll be floating upside-down
      by morning.'
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You should try homeopathic medicine, Bender. Take some zinc.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm 40% zinc.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Then take some Echinaea or a St. John's wort.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Or a big fat placebo. It's all the same crap.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey, what's rattling around in there?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It may well be the cause of Bender's illness. But more importantly,
      it's a flimsy pretext to try out my latest invention. To the laboratory!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I call this the F-ray. It's like an X-ray only it allows you to see
      through anything - even metal. Now, the neutrino beam it emits is a tad dangerous,
      so you'll all need protective goggles. You may feel a slight stinging sensation
      - all of you-- All of you!  Aha! There's the cause of your illness.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hey, that's my watch!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I was wondering where I put that.  Hey, now I feel much better! Thanks,
      Professor. And, Amy, I'm sorry I took your watch.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well, I've got to go take this suit to the decontaminators. You two
      lock up the F-ray and for the love of God don't let it fall into the wrong hands.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What should we point it at first?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I 'unno. Try it on me.  Ow! My sperm!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wow, neat! Mind if I try that again?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Huh, didn't hurt that time.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa, mama! Hold still, sexy lady.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's wrong?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's no lady!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, bite my shiny metal ass!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: All this prolonged exposure to radiation is making me thirsty.  Ah,
      if only there was some way of knowing which can had the winning bottle-cap inside.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Huh, w-what? I didn't hear you. I was too busy using this F-ray to look
      inside of things.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait a second. I'm getting an idea. N-No, false alarm. No. Yeah. No.
      Yeah. No. Wait. No. Yeah. Yeah. No ... no. Yes!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah, this thing stinks.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We checked 90,000 cans of Slurm and all we won was this junk.  I never
      wanna see another can of Slurm again. Man, am I thirsty.
  - character: LEELA

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You did it, Fry! You found the winning bottle-cap! We won!

  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: Welcome to the planet Wormulon. I'm Glurmo, your golly-rific guide to
      the splend-tacular Slurm factory.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh-huh. Can we have our free Slurm now?
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: You'll have all the Slurm you can drink later on when you're partying
      with my good friend Slurms MacKenzie.
  - character: SLURMS
    dialogue: Alright! Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Lay some skin on me, dudes!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wow! The original party worm!  Are you ready to get down, get funky
      with us?
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: He'd better be, that's what we pay him for. Right, Slurms?
  - character: SLURMS
    dialogue: Right!
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: In fact, Slurms has to party all night, every night - or he's fired!
  - character: SLURMS
    dialogue: (tired) Rock on!
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: 'But before the party, you''re all in for a fun-derful treat: A VIP
      tour of the Slurm factory!'
  - character: SLURMS
    dialogue: Enjoy the tour, dudes!  I'm gonna go lie down.
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: Welcome, my friends, to the wondrous world of whimsy that we like to
      call "Slurms Centralised Industrial Fabrication Unit".
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, my!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Look! Flowers! And a boat!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Who are those horrible orange creatures over there?
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: Why those are the Grunka Lunkas. They work here in the Slurm factory.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Tell them I hate them.
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: As we sail down the river of Slurm you'll see our mix-ologists at work.  They
      take 900 of the finest ingredients, add a touch of child-like delight and mix
      it all with glacial spring water from our glacial spring water generator. Then,
      last of all, we add the secret ingredient that makes Slurm so deliciously addictive.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So, what's the secret ingredient?
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: It's whatever your imagination wants it to be.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh. But what is it really?
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: (sternly) That's not for you to know. (normal) Now, over here the Grunka
      Lunkas are inducing Wumpus berries to release their flavour, using sensual massage.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (whispering) Psst, those berries. Those are the secret ingredient, right?
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: No.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You positive?
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: Yes.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm just asking cause they look kind of secret.
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: Enough! There will be no further questions.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Why?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey, look! The disgusting little men are starting to sing.
  - character: GLERMO
    dialogue: (shouting) Hey, I don't pay you to sing! You just used up today's bathroom
      break!
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: I heard that!
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: Now on your right, you'll see the Slurm Master checking the Slurm for
      colour and bouquet.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So thirsty.
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: Then he tastes it. He tastes it and tastes it, then tastes it some more.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, could I have some Slurm, please?
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: No food or drink allowed on the tour. You'll have to wait until you're
      partying with Slurms MacKenzie.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: When will that be?
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: Soon enough.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's not soon enough.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey, what's behind that door?
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: Nothing.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Is it the secret ingredient?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: OK, OK, we get the point.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I was just curious because of the armed guards.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Shut the hell up!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: So you're telling me I could fire my whole staff and hire Grunka Lunkas
      at half the cost?
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: That's right. They think they have a good union but they don't. (whispering)
      They're basically slaves.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What are you doing?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm dying of thirst. Grab my feet and dunk my head in so I can drink.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No. That's moronic.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Fine. I'll let go and swim around in the Slurm and drink as much as
      I want. Help! I can't swim!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, why did you jump in?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Everybody was doing it. I just wanted to be popular.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Where are we?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And why is the Slurm pouring into this sewer?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This isn't Slurm at all!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Something's rotten on the planet Wormulon. Look at this.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This all must have something to do with the secret ingredient.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: My God. What if the secret ingredient ... is people?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'No. There''s already a soda like that: Soylent Cola.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh. How is it?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It varies from person to person.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Ooh!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Do you have any that aren't so tight around the thorax?
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: Yes, over in-- Say, weren't there more people in your group at the start
      of the tour?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hey, yeah. Fry, Leela and Bender are missing.
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: If you'll excuse me.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (whispering) Quick.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look! Slurm! Finally!  Oh, yeah! I'm never going 12 minutes without
      a Slurm again.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's the end of the line. This must be where they put in the secret
      ingredient.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, whatever it is, it's even better fresh.  Mmm, still warm.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ew!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Blech!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, Lordy!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry!  Fry!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's the secret ingredient of Slurm?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's the only ingredient of Slurm.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ew!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'll save us!  Oh, that feels good!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Thanks, Bender!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: The exit! We made it.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, your majesty, I brought the prisoners.
  - character: GLURMO
    dialogue: Well, my curious friends, you learned the secret of Slurm. That concludes
      the portion of the tour where you stay alive.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You wish, you slimy worm! Heyya!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: How can you trick people into drinking something that comes out of your
      behind? It's disgusting.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Who's behind does that come from?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Look, we just came to party with Slurms MacKenzie. By the way, when
      is that scheduled?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah, this trip is turning into a big letdown.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What about me?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yes!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Mmm!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, untie us, quick!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Here I come.  Let me just-- One more taste.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You pig. Stop stuffing your craw and save us.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I can't see what's happening. Are we boned?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah, we're boned.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I can't stop eating this delicious ooze. But I'm not gonna let you die.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hurry!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What's happening?  Just in time!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (screaming) Nooo!  (talking) I could fit if I didn't have these damn
      arms!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We're close to the exit. I can smell those filthy orange guys.
  - character: SLURMS
    dialogue: Stop right there!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Slurms MacKenzie?
  - character: SLURMS
    dialogue: Shh! I want you to take me with you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Say what?
  - character: SLURMS
    dialogue: I'm partied out. All I want is to stay home and rent videos and watch
      them with a few friends. Is that so much to ask?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Forget it pal.  It says on this bottle-cap you have to party with us.
  - character: SLURMS
    dialogue: Alright, when we get to Earth. But please don't invite too many people,
      I wanna keep it small.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No can do, Slurms!
  - character: SLURMS
    dialogue: This way!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: She's gaining on us.
  - character: SLURMS
    dialogue: Go on without me, I'll hold her off.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But she'll crush you like a worm ... crushing a smaller worm.
  - character: SLURMS
    dialogue: 'It''s alright. I''m so tired of partying. So very tired.  I''ll save
      you the only way I know how: By partying!  Babes.'
  - character: DIXIE
    dialogue: Yes, Mr. MacKenzie?
  - character: SLURMS
    dialogue: You've served me well these 40 years, but this time I've got to party
      alone.
  - character: BABE
    dialogue: But--
  - character: SLURMS
    dialogue: There'll be other parties for you. Now go. Go!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Party on, Slurms!
  - character: SLURMS
    dialogue: Party on, contest winners. Party on.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: 'Commissioner, my crew has made a horrific discovery: It seems that
      Slurm is produced in a colossal worm hiney!'
  - character: COMMISSIONER
    dialogue: Hmm, "hiney", you say? Why, with your testimony we'll finally be able
      to outlaw this insidious Slurm.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Outlaw Slurm?  Uh, don't pay any attention to him sir ...
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: '... Grandpa''s making up crazy stories again.'
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I'm not your grandpa, you're my uncle! From the year 2000!
  - character: COMMISSIONER
    dialogue: OK, grandpa, we'll take care of the "bad worms," don't you worry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ah, I just wish Slurms MacKenzie were here to enjoy this with me.

  - character: JEFFERY
    dialogue: Um, I'm still a little woozy from a gazelle kick this morning but if
      he's anything like the common tree, the rings might indicate his age.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, well, good luck. It'd take some kind of genius to count all those
      rings.

    dialogue: Just make a simple cake. And this time, if someone's going to jump out
      of it, make sure you put them in after you cook it.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So it's a cake you want, is it? I'll make you a cake you'll never forget.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That'll take care of those annoying rats.  Now, to bake a cake so delicious
      they'll have no choice but to love and worship me.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: There! This'll teach those filthy bastards who's lovable. Now all I
      have to do is spell check it and it's ready for my admiring public.  No! Get
      away from there!  That's it.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Happy birthday!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, what's going--  (crying) No!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey! Can't you see I'm using the toilet?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Bender! How could you flush Nibbler down the toilet?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, step one, I had to lift the seat. That was the first little annoyance.
      Am I right, men?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (crying) Aren't you upset at all? How would you feel if I flushed Fry
      down the toilet?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Only one way to find out.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (crying) You have no sympathy for anyone else's feelings.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Of course I do. Right now I feel sorry for you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You do?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah. I mean, one cantaloupe-sized bloodshot eye? You ain't winning
      no beauty pageants, lady.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: 'And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet Nibbler, who''s gone to a
      place where I too hope one day to go: The toilet.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (crying) I wouldn't feel so bad if Bender just understood the pain he
      caused me.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Give it to me straight, doctor -- don't sugarcoat it.
  - character: DOCTORBOT
    dialogue: "Very well. Your entire family died when a plane piloted by your fianc\xE9\
      e crashed into your uninsured home. And you have inoperable cancer."
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Bet you weren't expecting that one, Calculon!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: It's like he doesn't understand simple humanoid emotion.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I wish just once Bender could feel exactly what I feel.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Actually, through the miracle of science, that can be arranged.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh-oh. Is this gonna be another crazy experiment that crosses a line
      Man was not meant to cross?
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: The official death toll in that tragic rocket crash has now been raised
      to 54,000.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, what the hell are you doing with my head?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I need to tinker in it.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Why don't you just use a potted plant like Fry?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Quiet, you. I'm installing an empathy chip.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And that'll allow Bender to feel other people's emotions?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes. If by "allow" you mean "force".
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ooh! Ow! Son of a-- Careful with that! Ow ...
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh dear, oh my. I got it. Once more.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: '... Ow! Professor!'
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Steady now.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: There we go.  Now I'll simply tune it to Leela's emotional frequency.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: My God, I'm overcome with ... feelings. I'm experiencing a powerful
      yearning to ... to cram my gullet full of mackerel heads.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: That's me, baby!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Hmm.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Now I'm worried that I'm not as smart as Leela, but at the same time
      I feel relieved that I'm cuter than her.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Uh ... that's me.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) Thanks for covering.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: This time I miss Nibbler and I'm feeling nosy and opinionated.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Bingo!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: That's Leela!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thank you, Professor. I'm happy that Bender can finally feel my pain.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Happy. I like this feeling. Just don't revert to your usual mopey self.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm not mopey. You shut up!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Anger, huh? How dare you make me feel anger, you one-eyed jerk with
      a dead pet!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thanks for taking me out, Amy. I feel slightly less miserable already.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hey, you know what'd cheer you up? You should get a puppy.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: A puppy? Nibbler loved to eat puppies.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's your problem?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) I miss Nibbler.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You do?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hell, no! It's Leela's stupid feelings. Why can't she just drink herself
      happy like a normal person?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh-oh, jealousy.  (shouting) You think you're so hot!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: The only reason you get all the guys is because you dress like a tramp!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (crying) They're just responding to my personality.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Um, Leela? Armando and I are going to the back seat of his car for coffee.
      You gonna be alright here by yourself?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (theatrical happiness) Sure. I'm having a great time -- really. You
      two go enjoy yourselves.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) I'm so lonely. I'm gonna go eat a bucket of ice cream.  (crying)
      A bucket of ...
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) The spoon's in the foot powder.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm at the end of my rope. I can't live another minute without poor,
      sweet Nibbler.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Too bad he wasn't an alligator. Y'know, when you flush those things
      they stay alive in the sewers.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Really?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yep. My friend's cousin's caseworker saw one once. It's a widely-believed
      fact.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hmm, sewers.  Thinking, thinking, thinking.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hang on, Nibbler. Uncle Bender's coming to save you.  Damn, it's too
      small. What did those human design this for anyway?  Aha! Bender, one; toilet,
      zero! See you on the other side!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender? Bender?!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Have you seen my sombrero?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Now he's flushed himself down the toilet? Who's he gonna flush next?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, it's your fault. He only flushed himself because your emotions
      made him feel bad.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You're right. I feel terrible.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, great, now you're making him feel worse!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I guess we'd better go down into the sewers and look for him.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Are you crazy? There's mutants down there! They'll eat you alive.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: They're hideous!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: There's no such thing as mutants. That's a ridiculous urban myth.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, don't be so sure. Many scientists believe humans really could mutate
      down there. Uh, due to exposure to toxic waste and radioactive runoff and good
      old American faeces.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: God bless America.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Phew! Uh, ladies first.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, and the aftertaste!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What is it?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I burned my finger.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, check the guidebook.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'Looks like we''re under Park Avenue. Ooh, ritzy! Just think: All this
      was probably once a charity luncheon for the Met.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait, what's that?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I never should have thrown out the manual.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, you didn't have to come down here.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I know. But I just missed Nibbler so much.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (crying) He was so cute.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) He was so sweet.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Eck! This emotional display is making me nauseous.  Or maybe it's whatever
      that is.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) Nibbler?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Nibbler?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's no use. We'd better turn back. Which way, Fry?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hmm. According to this map, the only way out is through ... that pipe.  Don't
      worry. It gets wider after about a mile.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (simultaneously) Idiot.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (simultaneously) Idiot.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: OK, OK, nevermind. I'll just ask those people for directions.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) Mutants!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Mutants! They're real!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'll take care of this!  Back! Back!
  - character: VYOLET
    dialogue: Thanks, handsome.
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: Please, do not be frightened, we're harmless.
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: I have three arms.
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: I said "harmless" not "armless".
  - character: VYOLET
    dialogue: Lay off him. You know he's only got one ear.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, aren't you supposed to be eating our brains? You're mutants.
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: Mutants? Perhaps it is you who are the mutants.
  - character: VYOLET
    dialogue: Please, Dwayne, have you looked in a mirror lately?
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: Welcome to our village. It may not be Paris but it has a certain quaint
      charm that I, for one, wouldn't trade for the world.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You guys realise you live in a sewer, right?
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: Perhaps. But perhaps your civilisation is merely the sewer of an even
      greater society above you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No, we're on the top.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Daylight and everything.
  - character: VYOLET
    dialogue: It must be wonderful.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Eh.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Listen. We actually came down here to find our pet, Nibbler. He got
      flushed down the toilet.
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: Well if he got flushed down the toilet he probably came through here.
      Everything always does. Follow me.  All that is ours was once flushed down your
      toilets. Over there is our aquarium.  This is our library.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand.
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: And over here is our church.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow. You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb?
  - character: VYOLET
    dialogue: Yeah, but nobody's that observant. It's mainly a Christmas and Easter
      thing.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) Nibbler?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So, is it true that alligators flushed down the toilet survive down
      here?
  - character: VYOLET
    dialogue: No. That's just an urban legend.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Then what are those?
  - character: VYOLET
    dialogue: Crocodiles.
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: We keep them as pets. Then, when they grow too large, we flush them
      down into the sub-sewer.
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: Some say there's a freakish race of sub-mutants down there.
  - character: VYOLET
    dialogue: Please, that's just a sub-urban legend.
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: Oh? Then I suppose you also don't believe in ...  ... El Chupanibre.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: El Chupanibre? What's that?
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: Gather round, children, for the legend of El Chupanibre.
  - character: VYOLET
    dialogue: Crocodile.
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: Whatever.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait. Our pet Nibbler loves fresh crocodile. It's his favourite treat.
      He must be El Chupanibre.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, yeah!
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: You unleashed the dreaded El Chupanibre upon us? Then you are our sworn
      enemies.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You don't understand. He would never hurt people. Let us help you capture
      him.
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: Impossible. If the legend is true, our only hope is to offer him a snack-rifice.
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: Yes. An unspoiled virgin.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I volunteer.
  - character: VYOLET
    dialogue: Nice try, Leela, but we've all seen Zapp Brannigan's webpage.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, I made myself feel bad.
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: She'll have to do. Chain her to the post!  And rip her shirt a little.
      Behold. When El Chupanibre comes for the, uh, "virgin", he will be snared by
      this rope trap.
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: (quietly) Shh. El Chupanibre comes soon. It is nightfall.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Nightfall? How can you tell down here?
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: The tide is coming in.
  - character: VYLOET
    dialogue: Quiet, the beast approaches.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Nibbler! Aw, come here precious!  Look everyone, it's El Chupanibre.
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: That's not El Chupanibre.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Say what?
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: That's El Chupanibre.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'll take care of this.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, do something.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm too scared.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted straight to Bender. If you
      care about Nibbler, stop caring about him!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I can't. I love every living creature.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Even me?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: As a friend.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Damn.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'Listen to me, Leela: I''m an expert at not caring. The secret is to
      stop giving a rat''s ass about anyone else and start thinking of the things
      that you want, that you deserve, that the world owes you.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, I could use a new tank top.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Bigger! Bigger!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: A fashionable tank top. And designer boots ... encrusted with jewels.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Don't stop now, you'll need some pants to go with that outfit.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah. And I could afford it all if I didn't have to feed that stupid
      Nibbler.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender's gonna be killed!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You know what else I could use? A weekend at one of those fancy spas.
      And a Toblerone.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (cheering) Yeah!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You did it!
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: Let's have a tissue-tape parade!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No thanks.
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: Gather round, children, to hear the legend of Bender.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That was a disgusting story.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: And it's all thanks to Bender. I love you, Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I love you too.  Get that stupid chip out of me before I kill myself!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Bender, you won't believe this, but the empathy chip burned out. The
      emotion you felt for Nibbler was actually your own.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Looks like Bender learned an important lesson about respecting other
      people's feelings afterall.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No, I'm wrong. The empathy chip was running at triple capacity.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, losers!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You know, Bender may not have learned anything from me, but I think
      I actually learned something from him.  (shouting) So long, jerkwads!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: So long!

    dialogue: Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six.  Check.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hmm. Get him, boys!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (hoarse) Good move.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good news, everyone.  We have a mission to further the noble cause of
      intergalactic peace.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Nope. Watching cartoons.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sorry.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What's the mission?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It's a delivery for the Democratic Order Of Planets.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: DOOP? What's that?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It's similar to the United Nations from your time, Fry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh...
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Or like the Federation from your Star Trek programme.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (getting it) Oh!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Tonight is the ribbon-cutting for the DOOP's new headquarters.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What are we delivering?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Something without which no ribbon-cutting ceremony could proceed. The
      ceremonial oversized scissors.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We'll get them there as quickly as we can.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Alright, but don't run with them.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow! There's a million aliens. I've never seen anything so mind blowing.
      Ooh, a reception table with muffins!
  - character: GLAB
    dialogue: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the
      DOOP's magnificent new headquarters. A fitting home for an organisation that
      has fostered peace throughout the universe. Even between the Insectoids and
      the Space Lizards.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So, what's it like on planet Amazonia?
  - character: AMAZONIAN
    dialogue: Big rats there. Me crush with club.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's so interesting. Maybe we could get to know each other over a
      coffee.
  - character: GLAB
    dialogue: I can think of no better place for this centre of diplomacy than here
      in orbit around the Neutral Planet.  What are your thoughts on this momentous
      occasion, Your Neutralness?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I hate these filthy Neutrals, Kif. With enemies you know where they
      stand but with Neutrals, who knows? It sickens me.  Halt.  Why, Leela. I do
      believe we've met.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (whispering) He means you guys did it.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: If you don't mind, we're here to deliver the scissors for the ribbon-cutting.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Then you're under arrest.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What for?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: How do I know these scissors aren't part of some Neutral plot?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But they're not even sharp. Who could I possibly hurt with them?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: The Yarn People of Nylar 4?  So, a plan to assassinate a weird-looking
      alien with scissors. How very Neutral of you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: 'It was almost the perfect crime, but you forgot one thing: Rock crushes
      scissors ... but paper covers rock ... and scissors cut paper. Kif, we have
      a conundrum. Search them for paper, and bring me a rock.'
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Why?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: So beautiful, yet so neutral.  Drag them to the ship.
  - character: GLAB
    dialogue: And now, to cut the ribbon, the legendary DOOP captain who just returned
      from a triumphant carpet-bombing of Eden 7, Zapp Brannigan.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: What makes a man turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just
      born with a heart full of neutrality?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Um, sir, you're supposed to be cutting the ribbon right now.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: No matter. I'll simply cut it from here with the ships laser.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Sir, I don't think that's wise.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Kif, if there's one thing I don't need it's your I-don't-think-that's-wise
      attitude.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Whoopsie-daisy.
  - character: GLAB
    dialogue: Zapp Brannigan, you stand accused of blowing up DOOP headquarters. How
      do you plead?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Absolutely 99% not guilty.
  - character: GLAB
    dialogue: Then the prosecutor will call his first witness.
  - character: GLAB
    dialogue: I'm going to allow this.
  - character: NEPTUNIAN
    dialogue: (simultaneously) You'd better believe it.
  - character: GLAB
    dialogue: The jury is instructed to disregard its own testimony.
  - character: GLAB
    dialogue: The evidence against Zapp Brannigan is strong. However, in light of
      his years of service, and the incompetence of this hillbilly prosecutor, I'm
      afraid I must dismiss all charges.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Dismiss all charges? Your Honour, I know the case is closed and you've
      rendered your verdict, but I wanna testify.
  - character: GLAB
    dialogue: I'm going to allow this.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's a stupid question. What matters is Zapp Brannigan is the sorriest
      captain I've ever seen, and I saw the idiot blow up DOOP headquarters with my
      own eye.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I'd like to cross-examine the witness.
  - character: GLAB
    dialogue: I'm going to allow this.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: We've met before have we not?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (reluctantly) Yes.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: And on that occasion, did you have sex with someone? May I remind you
      you are still under oath.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (reluctantly) Yes.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Please point out the person in this courtroom you had sex with.  And
      his name is?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Zapp Brannigan.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: The very same Zapp Brannigan who did not blow up DOOP headquarters.
      I rest my case.
  - character: GLAB
    dialogue: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you may begin your deliberations.
  - character: GLAB
    dialogue: Zapp Brannigan, you are hereby stripped of your rank as captain and
      dismissed from the DOOP.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I'd like to make one final statement. Kif c'mere and hold up the flag.  And
      wave it a little for God's sakes. My friends, you can take away a man's title
      and his uniform but you can never take away his integrity or his honour. Plus
      it was mostly Kif's fault.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: What?
  - character: GLAB
    dialogue: Kif Kroker, you are also stripped of your rank and dishonourably discharged.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: One day a man has everything, the next day he blows up a $400 billion
      space station and the next day he has nothing. It makes you think.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: No, it doesn't.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Come, Kif, it's time to begin our life as civilians.  That's an order,
      soldier.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, Bender?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Alright, this is the third hose fight I've broken up today and the second
      one using actual hoses. Now move your lazy asses and start scrubbing the ship
      like I ordered you to.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You don't have to get so mad, Leela.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, Fry already wiped off some of the dirt with his finger.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Zapp?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Leela, I didn't know where else to turn. You're the only woman who ever
      loved me.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I never loved you.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I mean physically.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What do you want?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Just let me work for a little food. Perhaps I could paint a fence, or
      service you sexually, or mop the floors.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You don't know how to do any of those things.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Kif might.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Leela, who are you talking to?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Just a broken-down hobo who's hit rock-bottom. And his commanding officer.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Why, you're that disgraced starship captain.  Having him on staff will
      distract people from our horrendous safety record. Come in.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I'd like everyone to meet our new employees. (whispering) Which ones
      are new?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: The green dude and the fat man.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Hmm, I could swear I've never seen that robot before either.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm Bender. You know? The lovable rascal.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course. Anyway, whoever you all are,
      I have good news. You'll be making a delivery to Stumbos 4, a planet with such
      high gravity you'll most likely be crushed under the weight of your own hair.
      Enjoy.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: So, this Leela. I know she's a very sensuous woman but what manner of
      captain is she?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: She's really strict.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And mean.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I see. Does she by any chance give the crewmembers spankings?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, she just makes us do work and stuff.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Good, good. But should she ever institute some sort of bare-bottom spanking
      policy let me go in your place. I won't have my comrades harmed.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, this guy's alright!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Here's to us poor schmoes working for the man. Even if he is a hot,
      sexy, female man.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: I've computed out landing co-ordinates, Captain.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thanks, Kif. Very nice work.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Wait, what?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I said "very nice work".
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: This is the happiest day of my life.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, crew, listen up. Your job is to delivery these 40 pillows to that
      hotel.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: They're not very heavy but you don't hear me not complaining.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: They're not heavy in here because we have an anti-grav pump. But once
      you get out on the surface the gravity will be very intense.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect me.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't want any screw-ups. Use the hover-dolly and just deliver one
      pillow at a time.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all the pillows at once.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: That's using the old noodle!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Come on, girdle. Hold!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh-oh.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What the hell happened?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Some breaking occured, the dolly was involved, that's about all we know.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I told you dumb apes not to overload it. Each of those pillows weighs
      150lbs here.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Alright, don't get your panties in a knot. We'll just use the back-up
      dolly.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'll start loading up the pillows.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No way, Jack. You disobeyed an order, so now you have to deliver all
      40 pillows by hand.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: 'Let me ask you a serious question, Leela: Does the company that made
      your bra make a girdle as well? I ask because a friend of mine--'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Just get to work.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (mocking) I'm Leela, get to work, neh neh neh.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I agree.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: The point is, it's just so humiliating working for that man. Once, he
      actually ordered me to ... shave his armpits while he was in the bathtub. So,
      I said--
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Y'know, why don't we talk about something besides Zapp for a while?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh, alright. Um ... well ... how 'bout then, um...OK, well, there he
      was in the tub, alright?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: This is all Leela's fault.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up dolly, we could have broken
      it, given up and gone home by now.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Y'know boys, a good captain needs many skills, such as boldness, daring
      and a velour uniform. And I'm not convinced Leela has any of those things.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish she didn't make us work so much.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Back when I was captain all I asked from my men was their complete loyalty.
      If I had that, then for all I cared they could sit around the whole day drinking
      beer in their underpants.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Beer?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Underpants?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: But now, Zapp's not captain anymore. I'm free!  Oh, you hear that? I'm
      actually laughing!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This is a mutiny.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the new captain.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: All hail the new captain.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Leela, you might be a formidible do-er of the nasty but I am forced
      to relieve you of your post.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: On what grounds, you slobbering oaf?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Failure to prevent a mutiny. Throw her in the brig.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We don't have a brig.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred
      to as "the brig".
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You really don't want me to be captain anymore?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You got it, genius.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But, didn't I do a good job?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You were mean and you yelled and you made us do all that work.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Sometimes a captain needs to do those things. Besides I, I thought we
      were friends.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, well, you shouldn't have been such a mean captain then.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Don't worry, Leela, soon we'll be able to look back on this and laugh.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Back in my old uniform, and it nearly still fits. Even after all that
      fattening hobo cuisine.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: What shall I do with your civilian clothes, sir?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Take them to the laundry-brig.  So, do I have your loyalty, men?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: To the ends of the universe.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ten hundred percent!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: That's not nearly loyal enough. I order you to sit around and drink
      beer until you're as loyal as Kif here.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes, sir, sir!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Um, may I have a beer, sir?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: No. You're loyal enough already. Meanwhile, I have a plan. We will single-handedly
      attack our archenemy the Neutral Planet.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh, jeez.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Once the neutral war machine lies in ruins, I'll be a hero again and
      the DOOP will reinstate me as captain.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: But, sir, that plan makes no sense.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Maybe not to you, Kif, but if I recall correctly, you were court-martialed
      in disgrace.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ooh, burn!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Nailed you, buddy!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Prepare to continue the epic struggle between good and neutral.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This is awesome! We're gonna be like pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna
      be like ...  ... and then we'll have pancakes to celebrate and I'll be like...
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Precisely. Now, in the name of all that is good and honourable, we'll
      call the Neutral President with a message of peace, then blast him.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes sir, sirdy-sir-sir-sir!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Fly the white flag of war.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: This is Zapp Brannigan of the good ship ... Planet Express Ship. I come
      swinging the olive branch of peace.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What now, chief?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Now we crash the ship into their headquarters, killing them in a hellish
      firestorm from which no living thing can escape.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Good, good, then what?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Then your mission is complete. I, meanwhile, will have ejected to safety,
      wearing the only spacesuit on board.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill us?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Of course. What do you think I meant by "loyalty"? Now help me into
      the only spacesuit. It looks a bit sweaty in there so you may need to apply
      baby powder.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela, we want you to be captain again.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Let me guess. He cancelled naptime? He ran out of beer?  So he's about
      to kill us?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We want Leela to be captain again.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: So it's mutiny is it? I never thought I'd see the day. Come, Kif, let's
      eject. I found a children's spacesuit you can wear.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: To be honest, sir, I'd rather stay here with Captain Leela. She actually
      listens to what I have to--
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, no! He's disabled the steering. We're gonna crash!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess ... and my banjo.  And Fry.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, OK. We have one chance. Are you willing to do what I say as captain?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Absolutely.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Even if I make you work hard?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: As your God is my witness.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't break and load all the dark matter
      into the left engine.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, man, that crap's heavy.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And warm.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Just do it.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age of 25.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I wouldn't worry about it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's too low.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Quick.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You did it! You actually did it!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And no one will have to punish anyone for the mutiny.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: And so, when Captain Leela panicked, perhaps distracted by female troubles,
      my quick thinking allowed me to do whatever I did to save the day.
  - character: GLAB
    dialogue: Captain Leela, is this rambling story of magic and heroism true?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, actually--
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (whispering) That a girl! If they don't take him back we can keep him
      as captain.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'Your Honour, it''s all true: My female incompetence, Zapp''s cat-like
      reflexes, the stuff that made no sense, all of it.'
  - character: GLAB
    dialogue: In that case, Zapp Brannigan, I hereby restore your rank and parking
      privileges.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, foo!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Come, Kif, we've got work to do.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: I-I'll call and tell you about it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela, I just want you to know that even though you're mean, you're
      the best captain ever.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can we have a week off?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Please?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Come on, Captain.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, alright.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No time off.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aw, man.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Let's mutiny!

    dialogue: Finally, solitude. I can read books for all eternity.  It's not fair!
      It's not fair! Wait, my eyes aren't that bad. I can still read the large print
      books.  It's not f --! Well, lucky I know how to read Braille!  Hey, look at
      that weird mirror!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Cursed by his own hubris!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: There's a political debate on! Quick, change the channel!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, that's what Fry said when we turned on the debate!
  - character: ANNOUNCER
    dialogue: '(voice-over; on TV) C-SPAN9 presents: The Thrill Of Politics.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look, I know there are no car chases but this is important. One of these
      two men will become president of the world.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What do we care? We live in the United States.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: The United States is part of the world.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow! I have been gone a long time.
  - character: JOHNSON
    dialogue: 'It''s time someone had the courage to stand up and say: "I''m against
      those things that everybody hates".'
  - character: JACKSON
    dialogue: Now I respect my opponent. I think he's a good man but, quite frankly,
      I agree with everything he just said!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: These are the candidates? They sound like clones.  Wait a minute. They
      are clones!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Don't let their identical DNA fool you. They differ on some key issues.
  - character: JOHNSON
    dialogue: I say your three cent titanium tax goes too far.
  - character: JACKSON
    dialogue: And I say your three cent titanium tax doesn't go too far enough!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: If I were registered to vote, I send these clowns a message by staying
      home on election day and dressing up like a clown.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You're not registered?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Nope. Not vaccinated either! Besides. It's not like one vote ever made
      a difference.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's not true. The first robot president won by exactly one vote.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah, yes. John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a cord with the voters
      when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: The point is, one vote can make a difference and even though it won't,
      I'm still taking you to get registered.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes, that's a capital idea. Let's all go register.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Professor, when did you become so obsessed with voting?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: The very instant I became old.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: The problem with both parties is that they always want to give your
      tax dollars to the less fortunate.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: The less fortunate get all the breaks!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: You know, Fry, you could join a third party, maybe.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Only weirdos and mutants join third parties.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Really? I'd better keep an eye out at the next meeting.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What party do you belong to, Bender?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm not allowed to vote.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: '''Cause you''re a robot?'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No, convicted felon.
  - character: WOMAN
    dialogue: We favour unreasonably huge subsidies to the Brain Slug Planet.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: OK, but what are the Brain Slugs who control you gonna do for the working
      man?
  - character: WOMAN
    dialogue: Attach Brain Slugs to them.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (sarcastic) Sure, you say that now!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: So, is it true you can make all kinds of shirts and ropes out of hemp?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I also heard hemp makes great shampoo.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: So what are you doing to protect my constitutional right to bear doomsday
      devices?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Damn straight! Today, the mad scientist can't get a doomsday device,
      tomorrow it's the mad grad student. Where will it end?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Sure, humans are cute, but how else are we supposed to test cosmetics?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: I concur.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Now here's a party I can get excited about. Sign me up!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (downbeat) OK then, screw it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (excited) Alright!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That was pretty cool. I think I'm actually starting to get interested
      in politics.
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: And so, with two weeks left in the campaign, the question on everyone's
      mind is who will be the next president of Earth? Jack Johnson or bitter rival
      John Jackson? Two terrific candidates, huh, Morbo?
  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: All humans are vermin in the eyes of Morbo.
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: "In other local news, disaster struck on Saturn\x92s moon of Titan today,\
      \ when a titanium mine collapsed, trapping 1,000 robot workers."
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What? Lord have mercy!
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: Unless something is done quickly, the trapped robots will be dead within
      300 years.  Sir, what rescue operations are planned?
  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: News of the mines closing sent titanium prices skyrocketing.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Alright! I'm rich!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What are you talking about?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: My body's 40% titanium!  I'm finally richer than those snooty ATM machines.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Too bad you can't spend it.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (ironic) Oh, can't I?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Watch me, poor man.
  - character: PAWNBROKER
    dialogue: (from inside) Pleasure doing business with you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Game's over, losers. I have all the money! Compare your lives to mine
      and then kill yourselves!  Hey, get away. Shoo! I'll give you five dollars to
      not do what you're thinking about doing. You just lost five dollars!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, buddy. Little help?  (shouting) Thank you!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hello, peasants.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender? What happened to you?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, you look different. Did you get a haircut?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No, I sold my body.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been down that road. I know it's glamorous
      and the parties are great but you'll end up spending every dollar you make on
      jewellery and skintight pants.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna live without a body?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Pft. Bodies are for hookers and fat people! All I need is a wad of cash
      with a head wrapped around it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, at least now you can pay off your loan shark.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, right. What's he gonna do, break my legs?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah, this is the life. Another martini, please.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Shaken, not stirred.  Aw, yeah!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Put it all on black.
  - character: CROUPIER
    dialogue: 21 red.  I beg your pardon, 33 black.

    dialogue: Yes! The rich get richer!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Strike! In your face, Leela!  Ow!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Timber!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, Bender, can I take a ride in your car?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Maybe if you clean up first. It looks like your neck stepped in something.
      Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey! You look me in the shins and say that.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'I''ve had it up to here with this place. I''m off to the Head Museum

    dialogue: I recognise you. Didn't you used to have a body of some sort?
  - character: SCHIFFER
    dialogue: Yeah, but it was holding me back. You know, I just did the cover of
      the Sports Illustrated Swimcap Issue.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, you're looking great.
  - character: SCHIFFER
    dialogue: Thanks. I wouldn't mind losing a few pounds though.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Couldn't hurt.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah, US presidents.  Sturdy shelves, good security.  This place has class.
  - character: CLINTON
    dialogue: (to Leela) Hey, sugar cookie. You know, legally, nothing I can do counts
      as sex anymore.
  - character: FORD
    dialogue: I apologise for his rudeness, ma'am. He gets this way around meaty-looking
      women.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (to Clinton) Hey, I remember you. I was gonna vote for you one time.
      But voting isn't cool so I stayed home alone and got trashed on Listerine.
  - character: FORD
    dialogue: Frankly, I've never felt voting to be all that essential to the process.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: No kidding, Ford.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So then the hookerbot says, "That's not my expansion slot" and my friends
      says, "That's not my gold-plated 25-pin connector!"
  - character: WASHINGTON
    dialogue: Oh, Bender. Thou robots really cracketh me up.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You know, I like it here. What's the rent on one of these jars?
  - character: CARTER
    dialogue: Maybe Mr. Bender can get a spot in the closet of presidential losers.
  - character: DOLE
    dialogue: Bob Dole needs company. LaRouche won't stop with the "knock knock" jokes.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Pass.
  - character: WASHINGTON
    dialogue: So, telleth, Bender. What hath happened to your body?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I hocked it.
  - character: WASHINGTON
    dialogue: Hocked it? Why wouldst thou do that?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Same reason you hocked your teeth.
  - character: WASHINGTON
    dialogue: Ah. Booze money.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: I remember my body; flabby, pastey-skinned, riddled with phlebitis.
      A good Republican body! God, I loved it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I hear that. I spent most of my teen years loving my body. Course, it
      was tough love but -- ooh!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, he opened up relations with China. He doesn't want to hear about
      your ding-dong.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So, Nixon. Even if you miss your body, being a head's great too, right?
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: No, son. It's a sad and lonely life.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, great. Now you tell me!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: That's my style. I like to kick 'em when they're down!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (sleep-talking) Ones...zeros...one, one, zero, zero, one --
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender, what is it?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa, what an awful dream. Ones and zeros everywhere. And I thought
      I saw a two.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It was just a dream, Bender. There's no such thing as two.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I know what this is about. My body loved me, and I turned its back on
      it. Well, old friend, tie a yellow ribbon round your neck, 'cause I'm a-comin'
      home!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You sold my body? To who?!
  - character: PAWNBROKER
    dialogue: I can't reveal that information, but you look like a nice robot. Tell
      you what, I'll give you 50 bucks for the kid.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, my clothes are worth 50 bucks!
  - character: PAWNBROKER
    dialogue: Deal.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) Oh! How could I let this happen? I can't go through the rest
      of my life like this.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Don't you have a self-destruct button?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) Yeah, but it's on my body. What am I gonna do?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ah, I can't stand to see a robot cry. Let's watch TV!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: And so, ladies and gentlemen, I'm throwing my head into the ring. I'm
      announcing my candidacy for the presidency of Earth.
  - character: CHANG
    dialogue: Scoop Chang, Beijing Bugle. Sir, the constitution clearly states that
      nobody can be elected president more than twice.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: That's right, nobody.  But as you can plainly see, I've got a shiny
      new body!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, he's got your body!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That dirty, double-crossing bastard! How dare he run off with Richard
      Nixon!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Nixon must have bought your body from the pawn shop.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, and that electric guitar.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: (singing; on TV} Remember what the dormouse said
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah you are, you stole my body! Fry, Leela, you gotta help me!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Ordinarily I'd say no and lecture you on how this is your own fault
      for being such an idiot. But when a robotic Nixon is on the loose, we have a
      duty to take action. Idiot.
  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: 'Morbo will now introduce tonight''s candidates: Puny Human #1, Puny
      Human #2, and Morbo''s good friend, Richard Nixon.'
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Hello, Morbo. How's the family?
  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: Belligerent and numerous.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Great. First he steals my body, now he's touching my stuff.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Come on. We've gotta find some way to talk to him.
  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: 'Morbo demands an answer to the following question: If you saw delicious
      candy in the hands of a small child would you seize and consume it?'
  - character: JOHNSON
    dialogue: Unthinkable.
  - character: JACKSON
    dialogue: I wouldn't think of it.
  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: What about you, Mr. Nixon? I remind you you are under a truth-o-scope.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Uh, well, I, uh...the question is-is vague. You don't say what kind
      of candy, whether anyone is watching or uh... At any rate, I certainly wouldn't
      harm the child.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: What are you talking about? They ate me alive out there.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Nixon with charisma? My God, I can rule the universe!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Give me my body back you two-bit thief!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Now look here, you drugged out communist. I paid for this body and I'd
      no sooner return it than I would my little cocker spaniel dog, Checkers.  Shut
      up, damnit!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Please, Mr. Nixon. We're appealing to your sense of decency.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That was a good one!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Seriously though, I'm never giving back this body. Now beat it! Before
      I get Cambodian on your asses!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) It's hopeless. We might as well turn in my head for the five
      cent deposit.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No way! I'm not letting my best friend get recycled. Not for five cents,
      not for five hundred cents! Leela, I've got a plan!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I've got a better plan.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) Why would Nixon stay at the Watergate?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (whispering) They give you a discount if you've been here before.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Keep going, we're right behind you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa, mama! Get a room, you two!
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: We're in a room!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well then lose some weight.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: (sleep-talking) Aroo!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: (sleep-talking) Oh, yeah. You women's libbers really know how to party!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (whispering) Psst! There I am!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: (sleep-talking) Hey, Betty Friedan. Send a little of that lotion my
      way!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, almost got it. Steady. Steady. Don't panic.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ooh!  Uh-oh!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: What the...?  You shaggy peaceniks have some nerve!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm just here for what's mine. Don't make me kick your neck.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Bring it on, soup can.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Alright, break it up, you two!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: That's it. You're all going to jail. And don't expect me to grant a
      pardon like that sissy, Ford.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You'll never pardon anybody because you'll never get elected president.
      The voters of Earth aren't the pea-brained idiots they were back in your time.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Oh, no? Well, listen here, missy. Computers may be twice as fast as
      they were in 1973 but your average voter is as drunk and stupid as ever. The
      only one who's changed is me. I've become bitter and, let's face it, crazy over
      the years. And once I'm swept into office, I'll sell our children's organs to
      zoos for meat and I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, he lost my vote.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Like one vote ever made a difference. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm
      going to inch myself over to the phone and call the police.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Not so fast, Nixon! Are you familiar with audio tape?
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Uh-oh. I don't like where this is heading.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: And I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: My God? I really sound like that? I thought my voice had more of a Clark
      Gable quality.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: The jig's up, Nixon. We'll trade you the tape for the body.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Oh, expletive deleted. You've got a deal.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, I've got one last thought.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah, it's good to be back in one piece again. Except I can't get these
      damn bumper stickers off.
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: The sheer drama of this election has driven voter turnout to it's highest
      level in centuries -- 6%
  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: Exit polls show evil underdog Richard Nixon trailing with an estimated
      zero votes.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yes! The system works!
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: The time is 7:59 and the robot polls are now opening...and the robot
      vote is in. Nixon has won!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Get out of town!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Why would robots vote for Nixon now that he's just a head in a jar?
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: (shouting) Nixon's back!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I can't believe it. He won by a single vote.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well it ain't my fault. I'm a non-voting felon, thank you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well it's not my fault either 'cause I forgot to vote.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, crud. I knew there was something I meant to do today.
  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: Morbo congratulates out gargantuan cyborg president. May death come
      quickly to his enemies.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Aroo! Who's kicking who around now? Aroo! Aroooo!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Knock knock!

  - character: BENDER

    dialogue: Come on, everyone. Perhaps some skiing will help us forget the mouldy
      old antics of Conan O'Brien.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Yeah!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Great idea!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: We can only hope!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This snow is beautiful. I'm glad global warming never happened.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Actually it did. But thank God nuclear winter cancelled it out.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hi!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Enough of your mindless chitchat, let's get going.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Jah damnit! We're stuck.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: At least you're not cold blooded!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Sweet lion of Zion! Look at the Professor go.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look out! We're heading straight for those trees!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah, yeah, relax. Trees down.
  - character: TREES
    dialogue: (mechanical voice) Trees down.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Cool. Hey what do you do if you want the trees up?
  - character: TREES
    dialogue: (mechanical voice) Trees up

    dialogue: (shouting) Mommy!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: You, a bobsledder? That I'd like to see!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Listen, you filthy crab, a thousand years ago there was a legendary
      team of Jamaican bobsledders.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yup, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics then retired to promote
      alcoholic beverages.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: A true inspiration for the children. Um, a little help please?  (screaming)
      Nooo!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, what the hell!  Ow!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You poor man. What happened to you?
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: Well, there I was on the triple diamond slope, when suddenly--
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh, excuse me.  Hello there.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Wha?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah! Nothing like a warm fire and a Super Soaker of fine cognac.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, it really puts you in the Christmas spirit.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: What-mas?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Christmas. You know? X-M-A-S.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, you mean Xmas. You must be using an archaic pronunciation. Like
      when you say "ask" instead of "aks".
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Xmas, huh?  Y'know this'll be my first Xmas away from home.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'Hey, hey. Let me aks you something: Would it cheer you up if we went
      and cut down an Xmas tree?'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah! An old-fashioned Xmas tree!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey! These aren't Xmas trees!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Eh wha?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: They're supposed to be some kinda, you know, pine tree.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Pine trees have been extinct for 800 years, Fry. Gone the way of the
      poodle and your primitive notions of modesty. Ah! Brisk!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This isn't the way Christmas is supposed to be.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: There, there.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Everything's changed.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's not true.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (nostalgic) Every Christmas my mom would get a fresh goose for goose
      burgers and my dad would whip up his special eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes.
      This dumb holiday just makes me think of all the things I left behind. Let's
      just stop talking about Xmas.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Happy Xmas, Xmas people! Xmas cards have arrived! Xmas!  Amy, there
      you go, Fry, Professor, Zoidberg, a mighty haul for Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes! I got the most! I win Xmas!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: 'And last, but not least, the sweet flower of the office: Me. Hermes
      Conrad.'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hmm.  Ah, a picture of my mommy.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Huh? What's this?  A card from my cousin Zoidfarb.  Instead of "Claus"
      he writes "Claws"! Now that's humorous. Today's comedians could learn from this
      card.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's the point of Xmas when everyone you know died a thousand years
      ago? I'm the lonliest person on Earth.  Hey, Leela, how 'bout a little sympathy
      here, huh?  Yoiks! What was that about?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Fluh! She's an orphan.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes, and the only one of her species in all the known universe. What
      a lonely life.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: My God! Poor Leela.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (upbeat) Hey, buddy, heard you needed cheering up! Well old Bender'll
      make you laugh.  Look at me look!  Oh, man, I gotta work on my act!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I feel like a rat. Here I am whining like a pig while all along Leela
      was lonely as a frog. I could kick myself.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I'll do it for you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ow! Thanks.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You should be ashamed of yourself, Fry. You'd have to be blind not to
      notice that Leela's a cyclops.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Fry's over there, man.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Xmas Eve; Another day where I accomplish nothing.
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: The holiday season is a time of celebration for most. But it is also
      a time to remember the tragic suffering of the less fortunate.
  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: Earthlings do not yet know the meaning of suffering.
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: Earlier today I visited a shelter for down-and-out robots.  Homeless
      robots, too poor to afford even the basic alchohol they need to fuel their circuits.
      Is there anything sadder? Only drowning puppies. And there would have to be
      a lot of them.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Where are you going, Bender?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: To volunteer at a liquor kitchen for homeless robots.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Yeah, right! As if you ever did anything charitable.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm very generous. What about that time I gave blood?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Whose blood?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Some guy's.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I've got to do something to show Leela how sorry I am.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: So what's the problem? Just get down on your claws and do the apology
      dance.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So it's left, left, right-- Wait! I have a better idea! I'll go out
      and get her the perfect Xmas present. Something so great she'll never want to
      be unhappy again.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Just be back by sundown, mon.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We'll see. I like to haggle.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You can't stay out on Xmas Eve. You'll be killed!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Say what?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good Lord! He doesn't know about Santa Claus.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I know about Santa Claus.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot Company built a robotic Santa to determine
      who'd be naughty and who'd been nice and distribute presents accordingly. But
      something went wrong.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow! 2801! Anyway...
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Wait, you fool! Due to a programming error, Santa's standards were set
      too high and he invariably judges everyone to be naughty.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: If he catches you after dark, he'll chop off your head and stuff your
      neck full of toys from his sack of horrors.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Nice meeting you.
  - character: PREACHERBOT
    dialogue: Welcome, brother! May the blessings of the season be upon you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, yeah, amen. Listen, I'm one of those lazy homeless bums I've been
      hearing about. Could you point me to the free booze.  Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: There's this girl who I really like but she thinks I'm a jerk. Can you
      help me?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, I need to get her a gift. And I need it before sundown.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's funny!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, yeah! You filthy hobos sure kow how to live.  Hey, chief, someone's
      stealing your handkerchief full of crap.
  - character: PREACHERBOT
    dialogue: I'm sorry, Tinny Tim. Seems we ran out early tonight.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: My God! That poor kid!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You're the last store open. I need something for my friend Leela.  Just
      give me your best animal.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's a stupid animal. You're stupid! I said I want the best one. Now
      which costs more? The parrot or the Stink Lizard?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's a hell of a good parrot. Although, I could get 500 lizards for
      the same price. Girls like swarms of lizards, right?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Alright, I'll take the 500 lizards. No, wait, yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes!
      The parrot!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, I spent every penny I had but I bet Leela's gonna love you.  Hey,
      you're quite the talker, aren't you? Shut the hell up!  Ow!  Stupid bird! I
      know where you live.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hey, it's Leela.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Sorry I stormed out before. I didn't mean to ruin everyone's Xmas.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Huh? You were gone?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's just that I get tired of Fry always only thinking of himself.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: I hear that! I aks him to set the table. Instead he goes out to buy
      you a present. Selfish dog.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait! You mean he's still out? His life's in danger!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Why?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Alright, bird, you thought you could beat me in a game of wits. But
      you just met your equal.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aha! Cornered!
  - character: LEELA

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela! Oh, my God! You saved my life. I am gonna get you so many lizards.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You didn't need to buy me a present, Fry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I just wanted to do something to make you happy. I mean, I miss my family
      but you never even had a family.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's OK. You're lonely and I'm lonely. But together we're lonely together.
  - character: FRY

    dialogue: Merry Xmas.
  - character: FRY

  - character: SANTA
    dialogue: Ho, ho, ho!  You've been very naughty, Fry and Leela. I checked my list.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well check it twice!
  - character: SANTA
    dialogue: I perform over 50 mega-checks per second. You're both naughty for disregarding
      each other's feelings.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But we set things right. Fry even risked his life to get me a present.
  - character: SANTA
    dialogue: But what about your other co-workers? Did either of you ever stop to
      think about Dr. Zoidberg's feelings?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No! I swear!

    dialogue: Santa has something very special in his sack for you two!

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa, hold on! How about inviting us in for a traditional glass of hard
      cider?
  - character: HATTIE
    dialogue: Oh, alright. But just one glass!  (from inside) OK, that's enough.  I
      said that's enough!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (from inside) Get her purse!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Please let us live! We'll put out milk and cookies for you!

    dialogue: You dare bribe Santa? I'm going to shove coal so far up your stocking
      you'll be coughing up diamonds!

      Honestly, I didn''t see it coming!'

    dialogue: No, wait, I know these guys. They got nothing.
  - character: SANTA
    dialogue: Ho ho ho!  You've been very naughty, Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What? Me? I didn't do nothing. You're thinking of the kid.
  - character: SANTA
    dialogue: My God, Bender! Framing an orphan? That's so naughty I'll have to add
      it to my list right now.  Framing ... I-N-G ... ... an ...

    dialogue: 'Amy, this is for you: A set of combs for your beautiful hair.'
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh, that's so sweet. But I sold my hair to a wigmaker so I could buy
      a set of combs for Hermes.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Oh, the irony. I sold my hair so I could buy this third set of combs
      for Zoidberg.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Thank you. These'll come in handy for my new hair.  Finally I look as
      pretty as I feel!

    dialogue: Quick! The armour-plated chimney cover! Push! Push!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Use teamwork!
  - character: SANTA
    dialogue: You've all been very naughty. Very naughty indeed. Except you, Dr. Zoidberg,
      this is for you.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: A pogo-stick!
  - character: SANTA
    dialogue: As for the rest of you, I'm going to tear off your skin like wrapping
      paper and deck the halls with your guts.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah? Well I don't believe in Santa Claus. Come on, everybody, if you
      don't believe in him he can't hurt you.  Ow! God! The pain!
  - character: SANTA
    dialogue: Ho ho ho! Time to get jolly on your naughty asses!
  - character: LEELA

    dialogue: Xmas dinner, everyone.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, Bender? Where did you get that bird?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I found it lying in the street, like all the food I cook. Dig in, everyone.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You got the toenail!  Oh!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look, the food isn't what's important.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: The important thing is we're all together for Xmas. And even though
      I'm surrounded by robots and monsters and old people, I've never felt more at
      home.

      Oh, what is this? The Middle Ages?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but you've become a fat sack of crap.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sack?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: And, Bender, your beer belly's so big your door won't even close. And
      that doesn't even make sense.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Come on. We're taking you pigs to the gym.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: The gymnasium? Excellent, excellent. For some reason I'm frisky as a
      squid on Tuesday.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hey, who's up for a nice hot steam?
  - character: ZOIDBERG

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, what's that jazz on your head?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Enough with the questions. More weight! More!  More!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Maybe you could do more rips with less weight.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, looks like Zoidberg's finally coming out of his shell.  Get it?  He's
      coming out--
  - character: RANDY
    dialogue: Nice and gentle, we don't want any unnecessary stress.  Is there a doctor
      in the gym?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I'm a doctor!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I wonder why Dr. Zoidberg is acting this way. Out of all of us he always
      seemed the most normal.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I am normal. (sexfully) Amy, take of these rubber bands and I'll show
      you how normal I am!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Fool me seven times, shame on you. Fool me eight or more times, shame
      on me.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Maybe he has a parasite.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Maybe he is a parasite!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's always so sad when a friend goes crazy and you have to have a big
      clam-bake and cook him! Yee-haw!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Now, now, this won't do. Let me just give old Zoidy a sedative.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Ah, much better. You can take off these rubber bands now.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I'll do it.

    dialogue: Give it to me straight, Professor. Is it fin rot? It's fin rot, isn't
      it? Tell me it's not fin rot!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Relax, my chiton-y chum. There's no problem. You're just heavy with
      male jelly.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bleck!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It must be mating season for Zoidberg's people. A chaotic time when
      his behaviour is dictated by the tiny brain in his rump.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Eck!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: There's only one thing we can do...
  - character: BENDER

  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: '...We, by which I mean you, will have to rush him to his ancient homeworld
      which will shortly erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, baby, I'm there!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, do you even understand the word "invertebrate"?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested in. (shouting) Uh, no need
      to pack pants, people. Let's roll!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these while he's gone.

    dialogue: Excellent, excellent!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Is that how you say "Zoidberg"?

    dialogue: You didn't have to call attention to his speech impediment.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You're looking less nuts, crabby.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I'm feeling less nuts, thank you, because tomorrow I will be depositing
      my jelly in the cloacal vents of a female. (sexfully) If you catch my drift.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Who's the lucky lobsterina?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I don't know yet. But I shall attract one this afternoon with an erotic
      display.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's amazing that your people can fall in love so fast.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Love? That word is unknown here. I'm simply looking for a female swollen
      with eggs to accept my genetic material.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You and me both, brother!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Ah, my old scuttling grounds! Let's pull over.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I used to hang out here as a larva. It looked so much bigger back then.
      Who's the tough guy now, Vinnie?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Look! Outdoor theatre! Let's get tickets. Oh, let's do!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: No, it's the ceremony of Claw-Plach, where my species fight to the death
      over matters of honour. Also whether abbreviations count in Scrabble. (angry)
      They don't!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I didn't come here to see any activity involving two guys. Where do
      you people do your erotic display?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: 'Same place as your species: The beach.'
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: How do I look?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Like whale barf.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Then the illusion is complete.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, I wonder if these guys are here to watch the erotic display too.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Perfect! This oughta make me stand out. Craw!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look how ridiculous they look.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Please, he's no different from the rest of you organisms; Shooting DNA
      at each other make babies. I find it offensive.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Craw!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Craw?!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Craw!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Cra-- Oh, what's the point?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: '''Cause he''s a loser, that''s why. He''s the lobster equivalent of
      Fry.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey! I can get any girl I want anytime I want. I'm just too busy.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Edna?! Edna, it's me, Zoidberg. Remember? From high school?  You used
      to laugh at me because my face was covered with barnacles!
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: Zoidberg? Well I didn't know you were back in town. I heard you went
      off and became a rich doctor.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I've performed a few mercy killings. So, as long as I'm in town I was
      wondering if maybe ... craw?
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: Oh, gee, yeah, I'm just going through a lot of things right now and--
      Look, Zoidberg, I carry more eggs than any other female and I owe it to our
      race to pick a mate who's stuffed with male jelly. Maybe a rock star.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Or maybe a doctor?
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: I'm sorry, Zoidberg. You're just an inferior male specimen. Nice seeing
      you again.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (crying) No one will ever want to mate with me, not with a puny claw
      like this. Did you see those other guys? They looked like giant claws with bodies
      attached.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: At least you didn't smell as bad as them.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (crying) You're right, my stink gland is weak. Smell!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Listen, Doc, if you wanna score you gotta fake like you're in love.  Just
      look her in the eye, start crying and say (fake crying) "I've never been so
      happy".
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: If a guy ever did that to me I'd know it. Wait a second. They've all
      been doing that to me. Even Sean!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Hmm, this "love" intrigues me. Teach me to fake it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: OK, you're on a date. What's the first thing you do?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Ask her to mate with me.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No. Tell her she's special.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: But she's not. She's merely the female with the largest clutch of eggs.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, tell her that. And then?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Then mating.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No. Make up some feelings and tell her you have them.  Yes?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Is desire to mate a feeling?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You're not even trying!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: It's all so complicated with the flowers and the romance and the lies
      upon lies.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: OK, OK, don't worry. The love meister will take you under his wing.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: What? Now there's a bird involved?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: OK, go ahead.
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: What the--? Dr. Zoidberg, your mating display failed. Why are you trying
      to talk to me?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (shouting) I have no idea.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) You just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (shouting) I just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating. (whispering)
      Fry, that doesn't make sense.
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But OK.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: '(whispering) Start with a compliment: Tell her she looks thin.'
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (shouting) You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from internal parasites?
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: Why, yes. Thanks for noticing.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) Now ask her how her day was.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Why would I wanna know?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) You wouldn't. Ask anyway.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (shouting) How was your day?
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: Well first I got up and had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth.
      Then I went to the store to buy some fish. Then...
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Fry, look what you did, she won't shut up.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) That's normal. Just nod your head and say "Uh-huh"
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: '...And then you threw an octopus at my window. You know, Zoidberg,
      it''s crazy but when you talk this way your obvious deficiencies as a male seem
      ... less obvious. Your genes seem less detrimental.  You even stink more.'
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Do I ask her to mate now?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) Third date!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So I returned his artificial heart and ever since then I've been known
      by the name of Honest Bender.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (reading) I'd like to propose a toast to ... coat check number 84.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) Turn it over.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Oh, Edna! (reading) Of all the slimy, gross crab monsters on this planet,
      you are apparently the hottest.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oy.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: Yes, well ... excuse me, I've got to powder my mouth flaps.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, me too.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I'm confused, Fry. I'm feeling a strange new emotion. Is it love when
      you care about a female for reasons beyond mating?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Nope. Must be some weird alien emotion.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Zoidberg said some dumb stuff but he's a nice guy, really. It's just
      that Fry's been telling him what to say and Fry's a ... do you have idiots on
      your planet?
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: Fry? You mean words of such beauty came from the blowhole of that hideous
      alien?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah ... What? Look, never mind the words. Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor
      honey.
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: Hmm.
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: (from inside) Come in.
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: (sexfully) Hello, Fry. Can I interest you in some surf and turf?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No thanks. I just came to tell you that Zoidberg's really great. He's
      got male jelly coming out the wazoo.
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: Well that is where it comes out but jelly isn't everything.  I know
      Zoidberg's magical words were really yours. Teach me to love you, squishy poet
      from beyond the stars!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, I'm flattered, really. If I was gonna do it with a big, freaky mud
      bug you'd be way up the list!
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: Hush, you romantic fool! Engage your mandibles and kiss me!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Edna, I couldn't stand it any longer. I--  (angry) Fry!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Dr. Zoidberg, it's not how it looks.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (angry) Her caviar is on your neck!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But--
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: Oh, it's true, Zoidberg. We can't hide it any longer. Fry and I have
      fallen in love and we're going to mate tomorrow.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What?!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (angry) Fry!  I challenge you to Claw-Plach!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: English please?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: A fight to the death.
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: And if you survive, we'll make sweet love!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But I don't want her!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Get ready, Fry. I'm going to rip your swim bladder out and show it to
      you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Dr. Zoidberg, this is madness. You're being irrational.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (shouting) Of course I'm being irrational! I'm in love!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Aww.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Right, right.  You have to stop this madness.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fate is cruel and unyielding and what must be must be. (shouting) Takin'
      all bets! I'm giving 9-2 on Zoidberg, the crab with the jab! The Great Red Hope,
      come on baby!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: 'Fry, it''s been years since medical school so remind me: Disembowelling
      in your species - Fatal or non-fatal?'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Fatal.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Large bet on myself in round one!
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: I do. I just want to say that today I got up and I had a piece of toast.
      Then I brushed my teeth--
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) Shut up!
  - character: EDNA
    dialogue: I love you, Fry!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I choose my own claws! I want the tactile pleasure of chopping him right
      here in the gonads!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Shh! Nobody correct him!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fry, I've never asked you for anything before but if it's not too much
      trouble, when it comes to the ninth round just let him win.
  - character: FRY

    dialogue: Aha!  Oops!
  - character: EDNA

      Claw-Plach!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: My fellow fish monsters. Far be it for me to question your stupid civilisation
      or its dumb customs. But is squeezing each others brains out with a giant nutcracker
      really going to solve anything? Dr. Zoidberg is my friend. And though a woman
      has come between us, I say we'll always remain friends. And you know why?  One
      reason.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You bastard! I'll kill you! You bastard!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone.

    dialogue: Edna?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Ew!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, my God!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: The frenzy!  Oh, the greatest experience in life and I missed it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aw. I'm sorry, Doc.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ow, ow! Ah!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: The frenzy is over. How will I ever get rid of my male jelly now?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'll lend you this.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, hey.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Shoo! Get away! Hey! What's with the flying jerks?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: They come to feast after the frenzy. Once my species passes on its genes,
      it dies.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You mean you have to choose between a life without sex and a gruesome
      death?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Yes.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Tough call.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Well it was nice of you to let me reattach your arm, Fry. Especially
      after I made a complete eel out of myself.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No biggie.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: 'Yes biggie. I learned to feel things I''d never felt before: Love,
      jealousy, passion for disembowling. I owe it all to you.  There! I pronounce
      the operation a success.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hooray!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (laughing) Yeah!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I may not know from emotions but when it comes to medicine, forget about
      it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't mean to nitpick, super-doc, but do you think maybe you could
      take one more whack at this?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: For you, my friend, anything.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (from ship) My legs!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (from ship) Alright, alright, third time's the charm.

      a man than a Thundercougarfalconbird. So how much were you thinking of spending
      on this Thundercougarfalconbird?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sorry, I'm not here to buy.

  - character: VICTOR
    dialogue: Yes, and yet--
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: What's wrong?
  - character: VICTOR

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hermes. Who were you yelling at?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Myself. I asked myself a Valentine's Day off. But I was in no mood for
      any of my shenanigans.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Valentine's Day's coming? Oh, crap! I forgot to get a girlfriend again.
      Well since neither of us has a date, why don't we...
  - character: LEELA

  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hey, I'm taking my new car out for a spin to Mercury. Anybody wanna

    dialogue: 'Hey, tell me something: You''ve got all this money, how come you always
      dress like you''re doing your laundry?'
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I guess 'cause my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike.  As though!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear
      underpants. What am I, the Pope?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Yeah, and if you were the Pope they'd be all, "Straighten your Pope
      hat," and, "Put on your good vestments". You know, Fry, its nice to find someone
      I can talk to about stuff, and junk.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, it's like we feel the same way about junk and stuff, or, whatever.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: So while they're towin' us, you wanna do it?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah.
  - character: HERMES

      old business? Any new business?  Anyone spend the night together?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Yep.

    dialogue: Kind of.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What?

    dialogue: Oh, my God!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: We ran out of fuel on Mercury and one thing led to another.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And it led there again when we got home.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Congratulations, Fry, you snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich,
      she's probably got other characteristics.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender! Romance isn't about money.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg here is desperately poor
      and miserably lonely? Puh-lease!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: For your information, it's because he's hideous.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Well I think Amy and Fry go together like a lime and coconut.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Do I hear wedding bells?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What? No!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Really? Oh, dear.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: You're both very lucky. I'd pay anything to end my miserable loneliness.
      If only I weren't so desperately poor.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think
      I have a scheme so deviously clever that I--
  - character: JUDGE
    dialogue: $500 and time served.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Stupid anti-pimping laws.  Well, pay the man!
  - character: HOOKERBOT
    dialogue: Bender, honey, we love you!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Shut up, baby, I know it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping but you rarely have to use the
      phrase "upside your head".
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, this is stupid. Why would anyone come to you for romantic help?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey! Don't make me go upside your head!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: (shouting) Fry! Amy! Put your pants back on; I need a stapler.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Stop! Stop! If you interrupt the mating dance the male will become enraged
      and maul us with his fearsome gonad.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) It's working, they think we're making out.  Wait, why aren't
      we making out?

    dialogue: OK, Mister...?
  - character: ZAPP

  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Let's see ... Oh, yes!  Yes, definitely. Oh, I'd like some of that.  Mmm,
      I'll just have everything on the menu.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Now to run it through our high speed romance-a-logical data-fier.  Say
      hello to Miss Right!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: (sexfully) Hello!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow! We're great kissers!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Yeah! Hey, later, you wanna drive out to Europa? We could have a picnic
      and spit watermelon seeds at Jupiter.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back in the 20th century. Ah, it's
      cool how we sort of think exactly alike, and junk.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Yeah. Y'know, Fry, I really like hanging out with you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Everything was going great. Then all of a sudden, she's talking about
      hanging out. Hangin out? She's getting way too serious. I'm not a one woman
      man, Leela.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You'll be back to zero soon enough.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Don't you get it? She's smothering me.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hi.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You see? You see? Now she's bothering me when I'm at work.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry--!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm doing my job -- there's Amy. I spend a few hours selecting a candy
      from the machine -- there's Amy. I wake up the morning after sleeping with Amy
      -- there's Amy!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I think you're over reacting.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Am I? (shouting) Am I? (talking) Face it, I'm a prize catch.  I mean,
      I'm pulling down delivery boy money.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, she's pulling down billionaire trust-fund money.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Then she wants me as a trophy husband. Leela, you gotta come to Europa
      with us, I can't be alone with her.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: So, ready for a secluded picnic with just you and me?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics with just you and me?  Uh,
      Dr. Zoidberg.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Did someone say something about a free hot meal?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Mmm, I haven't eaten since Tuesday! Bird eggs, animal slices ...  ...
      dry woven reeds!  All gone! Can I drive?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: No. So, Fry, you busy tomorrow? I got two tickets to the big ape fight.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Jeez, we're already planning to spend Valentine's Day together. Isn't
      that enough?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: OK, sure. What do you wanna do for Valentine's Day?
  - character: FRY

  - character: AMY
    dialogue: But you just said--
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, you drive.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Wahoo!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (from inside) Pardon me, excuse me.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Ah, I'll just turn the wheel to maximum fastness!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate but then you start to
      get tired of it because it always wants to hang out with you?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Huh? You don't like chocolate?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look, could chocolate just let me finish?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: 'Vroom vroom! And the winner of the big car race is: Hot Rod Zoidberg!'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Amy, what I'm trying to say is, I think maybe you and I should stop--
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Uh-oh. Here, you drive!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Fry? Are you alright?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? Was anybody hurt?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: No, no, no, no, no, of course not. Nobody but you. I'm afraid your body
      was badly damaged in the crash.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: How badly?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: That's it over there.  Don't worry, I managed to keep your head alive
      with some quick surgery.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Where is it?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: There.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Looks like we'll be spending a lot more time together, Fry!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This sort of thing always happens with office romances.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Don't worry, Fry, we'll have your body all fixed up in a few days.  Upsy
      daisy!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere with your life too much.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Fry!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: So, what was it you wanted to talk about before we crashed anyway?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, that.  Maybe we'd better talk in private. (whispering) I'll meet
      you in the closet.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Amy, I really like you, as a friend. But I think we're spending too
      much time together.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You're breaking up with me?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I just think we should start seeing other people.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: But, I was really having fun.  If that's how you feel.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm sorry, but it is.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Well, whatever. Hey, listen, as long as we're not seeing each other,
      you mind if I ask someone else out for Valentine's Day?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Huh?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I mean, unless it would make you feel bad, being a third wheel.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts
      of women!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: With my body I think you might only attract one sort of woman.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (happy) Oh! (disappointed) Oh!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So, how's business?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Are you familiar with my friend Al Gore? I'm tellin' ya, losers get
      really desperate around Valentine's Day.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah, it's pathetic alright!  How much?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 500 bucks.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Done.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Zapp Brannigan OK?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: '600.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you for a minute?  In private?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh, no problem.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's plans with some goon and
      I'm gonna be stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will you be my date, please?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You're too late, Fry. I'm sharing Valentine's Day with a very special
      man. He's not Zapp Brannigan or anything!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Then I have no choice but to do something so pitiful and embarrassing
      that I'm ashamed to tell you about it.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender's in his office.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Thanks.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I got your hook-up, Fry. Now my usual fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as
      how it's you, I'll need it in advance.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: OK, Fry, we're done putting on the bra.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something
      to happen with your Valentine's date?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: What business is it of yours?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'And another thing: You''re using an awful lot of make-up there.'
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: This is deodorant.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What does it do?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: (shouting) C'mon in, Gary! I'll just be another 20 minutes.
  - character: GARY
    dialogue: (from outside) I'll be waiting.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 20 minutes? You're practically ready now!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Yeah, but it's good to make them wait a little.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, God, it's true!
  - character: GARY
    dialogue: That dress looks great on you.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: (simultaneously) Thanks.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (simultaneously) Thanks.  Where is she?
  - character: GARY
    dialogue: I must say, Amy, you're all made up, just like Fry's date. Get it?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Mm-mm.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I've got a date. She'll be along any minute.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fry, look who I found! It's Petunia, your dream girl!
  - character: PETUNIA
    dialogue: How's them eats?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh--
  - character: PETUNIA
    dialogue: Don't mind if I do.  Kids'll be hungry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) She seems a little old for me.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: She is well-travelled. And I don't mean she travels a lot!
  - character: PETUNIA
    dialogue: Wheels fell off my house.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Now how about a rose for the lady? Five bucks a pop!
  - character: GARY
    dialogue: I'll take one.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, yeah? Well I want one too.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Eight bucks.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But you just said--
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Demand suddenly skyrocketed, you all saw it.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Leela, meets your future husband Sal.
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: Nice eyeball, eyeball.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Nice ass, ass.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ooh, sparks! (whispering) Buy her a rose, I guarantee she'll put out!
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: Eh, I'll take my chances.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Cheers!
  - character: PETUNIA
    dialogue: So tell me about your prospects. You a good gambler?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, ma'am I--
  - character: PETUNIA
    dialogue: What's your game? Bingo? Keno? Wait a minute! You don't have your own
      body.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, but I control this arm.
  - character: PETUNIA
    dialogue: Slots player, huh? Sorry, but I think I can do better.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait, come back, uh, darling.
  - character: PETUNIA
    dialogue: Can't, hon. I gotta catch my bus back to Nutley. I'd kiss you goodnight
      but I lost my teeth pulling out a stump.
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: So anyways, Leela, I'd love to take a whack at ya but that 10:15 to
      Nutley ain't goin' nowheres without yours truly behinds the wheel.
  - character: PETUNIA
    dialogue: Excuse me, did you say "10:15 to Nutley"?
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: Why, yes I dids.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (whispering) Bender! Did you just round up our dates at the bus station?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Of course not.
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: Anybodys else for Nutley?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Baby, wait! You didn't show me your surprise.
  - character: GARY
    dialogue: (whispering) You know what I'd like to do...?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, jeez, get a room!
  - character: GARY
    dialogue: Maybe later.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'Hey, I have an idea: Let''s all go out for ice cream.'
  - character: GARY
    dialogue: Actually, I thought Amy might like to come back to my place for coffee.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I don't really like coffee.
  - character: GARY
    dialogue: Neither do I.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Ooh, I feel a little tipsy!
  - character: GARY
    dialogue: Let me pick up the check.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Nooo!  That's it I'm gettin' the hell outta here.  Ooh! Ow!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'Why, if it isn''t my favourite head on Amy''s body: Fry.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, Leela!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: We were just on our way out.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Nonsense, the evening's young. So, Gary, what do you do for a living?
  - character: GARY
    dialogue: I'm a banking industry regulator.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Really? Y'know I heard that banking industry regulations are really
      very simple.
  - character: GARY
    dialogue: Oh, no, that's not true. You see, modern banking regulations are a product
      of five different regulatory traditions. Six if you wanna get technical.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, I do.
  - character: GARY
    dialogue: It all began in 1410 when a number of noblemen convened...
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: There you are, good as new. Except for your dorsal fin, I'm afraid I
      couldn't find it after the crash.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Can I live without it?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: If you call that living.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me graft a laser cannon
      onto your chest. To crush those who disobey you. But I guess we're just two
      different people.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And I hope there are no hard feelings
      about your date, or stuff.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: It's OK, I had fun. And if I ever feel lonely I can just look over at
      this disfiguring scar and think of you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own body back.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So how's the old corpse? Everything hooked up OK?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Seems to be. My neck's just a little tender.  Ow! Cool!  Ow! Listen,
      Leela. Thanks for rescuing me last night.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Anytime. I actually enjoyed hanging out with you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yep, everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Come on! It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so
      we'd spend Valentine's Day together.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No! You didn't! You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station
      and pocketed our money!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: True. But in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all
      about?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I guess so.  Watch the neck! Watch the neck!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: My ass! My beautiful ass!

    dialogue: I gotta say I'm really enjoying the day out with you people - Hey, a
      suicide booth! So long suckers.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, sorry Bender that's just a phone booth.
  - character: BENDER

  - character: NARRATOR
    dialogue: (voice-over) They traffic jams of Old New York were a public forum of
      free interchange of opinions.
  - character: NARRATOR
    dialogue: (voice-over) It all started with Gerald Ford's famous invention, the
      "automocar" ......which was powered by a tank of burning fossils. Here we see
      a 20th century assembly line where cars were constructed by primative robots.
  - character: ROBOTS

      1992 Latoura.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, my girlfriend had one of those! Actually it wasn't her's it was
      her dad's. Actually she wasn't my girlfriend. She just lived next door and never
      closed her curtains.

    dialogue: There's a baby in there huh?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's just like riding a bicyc -
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I think I got whiplash.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You can't have whiplash, you don't have a neck.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I meant ass whiplash.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm just glad we hit something. I thought we'd never stop.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: How's that robot I ran over?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: We did all we could.

    dialogue: We're both expressable as the sum of two cubes.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So uh, Flexo. Sorry about crushing your body like that. You OK now?
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Well I don't feel as bad as you look! Nah I'm just messing with you
      kid. You're alright. That's some face you got though, I think they got a cream
      for that.  Nah, you're great.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well just let me know if there's anything I can do to make it up to
      you.
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Actually your little stunt did a number on my back. You mind rubbin'
      it for me?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh...sure.
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Aw yeah, that's it. A little lower.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: How's that?
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Lower. Yeah that's it. A little lower though.

  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: I'll say, you're rubbing my ass!

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, no, that's alright.  Ow! Ow!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm telling you there's something about Flexo I don't like.
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Hey Fry, think fast.  Get it? It's chlorine!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: It's funny because it's poisonous!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah keep laughing brineshrimp but he's bad news. I regret ever running
      him over.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Take a rage dump man. He's no worse than Bender.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: He's much worse. He drinks, he smokes and he posts naked pictures of
      me on the internet.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: That's Bender alright.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm talking about Flexo.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh I get it, this is cute. You're jealous of Bender's new friend!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No I'm not. Mark my words. Flexo's evil. He's the evil Bender.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Rage dump!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Everyone get in bed with me. I have something to show you.  Feast your
      eyes on this!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's beautiful.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: And huge.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Can I touch it?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: So what is it already?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It's a single atom of jumbonium. And element so rare, the nucleus alone
      is worth more than $50,000.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: How much more?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: 100,000. That's why I hid it here. Under my mattress.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh Professor, can we discuss this somewhere else?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Why certainly.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: The atom sits atop this dime stored tiara which will be awarded to the
      winner of this years Miss Universe pageant on the planet Tova 9.  Your job is
      to deliver it, safe and sound.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Wow, when I was a little girl on Mars I dreamed of being Miss Universe.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's kinda pathetic.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Aw come on Leela. Deep down all girls wanna be Miss Universe.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Not me.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Really? Maybe it's just cute girls.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Due to the atom's tremendous value, Planet Express would go bankrupt
      if it was stolen. Therefore we'll need to hire on additional security for the
      mission.
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Oh oh Mr Professor, right here!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, maybe we should stick with people we know and trust. I mean, Flexo's
      great but -
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Flexo's great you say? Well that's good enough for me.  Welcome aboard
      lad.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Space banditos have been operating in this quadrant so you'll each take
      8-hour shifts guarding the safe. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait, I don't like the sound of that. Let's just go alphabetically.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait, let's go by rank.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Flexo outranks me?
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: That's "Flexo outranks me, sir"!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Halt. Who goes there?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Don't point that at me.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fry who?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look, I know Flexo's your friend but I don't trust him alone with the
      atom.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: My God Fry just 'cause the guy's got a beard you label him as evil?
      Well I got a label for you pal. An ugly little word called "prejudice."
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm not prejudiced.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah save it for the cross burning Adolf!
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Keeping an eye on the safe?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You know it!
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Well, looks like it's my shift. You lie down and go offline for a while.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Alright.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Caught you!  I saw you looking at the atom!
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: So? I look at lots of atoms. Shouldn't you be resting up for your shift?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh-ho you'd like it if I went to sleep wouldn't you?
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Whatever it takes to shut your yapper. Nah, I'm just kidding you, you're
      a joker.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah well here's a funny joke. I'm gonna sit right here till it's my
      shift.
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Suit yourself skinbag.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That I will.
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Good.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Good.
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Good.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Good.
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Good.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Good.  Good.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, that's eight hours.
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Yeah eight hours of solid boredom. Nah, I'm kidding, you're a wonderful
      man.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Finally, the atom is safe.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What is it?  My God! Did you hear maracas?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Then it wasn't space banditos.  Bender, lock down the ship, don't let
      Flexo escape.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aye aye captain. It appears that Flexo has outwitted us all. Especially
      me...Bender.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: How could Flexo have stolen the atom?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: He must have used a sleep ray on me. Sleep rays exist in the future
      right?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Then I must've fallen asleep.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well you were sure right about Flexo being evil.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I locked down the ship but he may have already gotten away.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, thanks Bender. Let's fan out and look for him.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Roger that, I got a map of the ship right here.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (whispering) Keep an eye on Fry. We can't rule out the possibility that
      he did it.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Aha!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aha!  Uh searching...hmm.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry? Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check
      again.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, he wasn't in the uh, kitchen room.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (suspicious) Say Bender, can I hold that map for a second?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Any leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt? I think not.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Give it up!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Alright, take it. Sheesh.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, looks like Flexo got away clean.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's a darn shame.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: He must have jumped ship with the atom the second we landed.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Or maybe, he never left at all!  Wait a minute. You're Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Of course, who said I wasn't?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But why were you wearing that scarf, that turtleneck and this fruity
      number?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's a little thing called "style." Look it up sometime.
  - character: BARKER
    dialogue: Our ninth finalist, Miss Methane Planet; Halatina Smogmeyer.  And our
      tenth and final finalist, Miss Earth's Moon, the Crushinator.
  - character: CRUSHINATOR
    dialogue: (mechanical voice) Thank you Bob Barker, I'm as happy as a girl can
      be. End statement.
  - character: BARKER
    dialogue: Which one of these lovely womanoids will take home the lovely tiara?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (whispering) Downplay the tiara.
  - character: BARKER
    dialogue: Uh, we'll find out after these subliminal messages.
  - character: BARKER
    dialogue: So you lost the atom huh? You're garbage, human garbage! Do you braindead
      space jockeys have any idea how much that thing is worth?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 100,000?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 200,000?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 200,001?
  - character: BARKER
    dialogue: You're closest without going over.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, we'll be leaving now. If you'll just sign this form saying you
      received the atom.
  - character: BARKER
    dialogue: I'm not signing squat. You find me that damn tiara before the pageant
      ends.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But Mr Barker -
  - character: BARKER
    dialogue: Enough out of you. I may be against the fur industry, but that won't
      stop me from skinning you alive! As long as no one wears the skin.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well gentlemen, it appears we're boned.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Flexo!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Get him!
  - character: BARKER
    dialogue: Next up in what is generously called the "Talent Competition," performing
      a traditional gangster rap, Miss - what the?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Got you!
  - character: WOMEN
    dialogue: (chanting) Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Shoot him, he's choking me!
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: No shoot him, he's choking me!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't know which one to shoot.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Flexo! Shoot Flexo!
  - character: AMAZONIAN
    dialogue: Women only room!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Alright, enough of this.  There's the atom!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aw jeez.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender? You stole the atom?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah but I can explain, it's very valuable.
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: I saw him snatch it while Fry was asleep. That's why I ran to tell Bob
      Barker.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Whoa whoa, you mean Bender is the evil Bender? I am shocked, shocked!
      Well not that shocked.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm sorry we suspected you Flexo. It's just, what with the beard and
      all.
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Don't even bother. You people sicken me. I put my life on the line to
      guard that atom and this is how you repay me? Well you can go rot for all I
      care. Nah, I'm just kidding, you guys are alright.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm so confused. The Bender I liked turn out to be evil and the Bender
      I hated was good. How can I live my life when I can't tell good from evil?

    dialogue: Alright, let's put an end to this pathetic hoedown. Brannigan read the
      thing.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: And the winner is...
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It figures. Who else but Zapp Brannigan would be judging the most chauvinistic,
      degrading, dehumanising -
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Huh? Leela?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait, you're making a -  Ooo! Look at that.  I feel like a princess.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Wait. What are you people, idiots? I'm still going mano a mano with
      this envelope. Miss Vega 4.  (singing) There it is, Miss Universe. There it
      is, looking weird.
  - character: LEELA

      woman from the radiator planet.

    dialogue: So how was the Spleef Nebula?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: (monotonous) The flight had a stopover on the Brain Slug planet. Hermes
      liked it so much he decided to stay of his own free will.

    dialogue: Hey, yeah!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I'm seeing a movie with friends!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Cool, let's see this one!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Nah. I'm not in the mood for a historical documentary. I've heard good
      things about Quizblorg, Quizblorg.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Guk! I hate subtitles. Alien films are so pretentious.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Fellows! Fellows! How about a film we can all enjoy? Planet Of The Clams.
      It's about an upside-down world where lobster is slave to clam.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'Who invited you? Let''s just see All My Circuits: The Movie.'

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Just ask Flabby over here to describe it to you later.
  - character: ROBOT
    dialogue: Sir, she is as the factory made her.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well they should have stopped making her about halfway through.

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, do you know who that was?
  - character: DOUBLEDEAL
    dialogue: Son, I'm the commissioner of Ultimate Robot Fighting. I'm a connoisseur
      of jerks like you who pick fights in movie theatres and you're the biggest I've
      ever seen.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You should see me at funerals.
  - character: DOUBLEDEAL
    dialogue: Kid, I want you in the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.

    dialogue: Ultimate Robot Fighting? Sounds pleasant! I'll do it.
  - character: FLABBY
    dialogue: My hero!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Aw. They don't make movies like this anymore.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm gonna be the greatest Ultimate Robot Fighter ever. Float like a
      floatbot, sting like an automatic stinging machine!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Bender, you can't be an Ultimate Robot Fighter. It's the most brutal
      form of competition in the galaxy!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It is?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: There are no rules. Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Then later the
      other robot leaves after being declared the winner.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, did I mention the crippling, agonising pain? I'm pretty sure I did.
      Oh, yes, definitely.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Crippling pain? That's not covered by my insurance fraud! Count me out.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No! You've got to do it. I don't care how suicidal it is.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey! How come when I wanna do fun stuff that'll kill me you're against
      it?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This is more important than that marble-eating contest, Fry! It's about
      pride. Let me tell you a story from my childhood.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Oh, again with the orphanarium!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: When I was growing up at the orphanarium, I got picked on a lot...
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (voice-over) ...My only outlet was Arcturan Kung Fu.
  - character: FNOG
    dialogue: Excellent. Bill, Keith, you will go to Junior Championships. Bill, congratulate
      Keith when he regains consciousness.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But, Master Fnog, I can beat these dorks with one eye closed.
  - character: FNOG
    dialogue: Perhaps. But there is more to winning than beating your opponent. You
      lack the will of the warrior.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What do you mean? Watch this!
  - character: BILL
    dialogue: (crying) Ow!
  - character: FNOG
    dialogue: No girl has the will of a warrior. You have the will of a housewife
      or, at best, the schoolmarm.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's it. I'll take you on right now.
  - character: FNOG
    dialogue: Very well. But, you see, I have the will of the warrior. Therefore,
      the battle is already over. The winner? Me!  Rematch? You lose again! Had enough?
      I thought so!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I lost my chance to be a champion. I won't let you throw away yours.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Leela's right! I don't wanna end up a loser like her. Count me back
      in!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Let's see what you got. Touch your toes.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Still ... can't ... reach!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Let's commence preparations for rumbling!
  - character: REFEREE
    dialogue: 'Ladies and gentlemen and smizmars, welcome to tonight''s main event.
      In this corner, from Mom''s Friendly Robot Factory in America''s heartland,
      Mexico: Bender! And in this corner, from and made of Parts Unknown: The Clearcutter!'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) Bender rules!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: (monotonous) I got you an official Bender hat.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow! Thanks, Hermes!  I-- Hey! Cut that out!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You can't hit what you can't see!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Get up, Bender. You can't quit every time you get an axe in the back.  Or
      a drill through your face. Now quit scratching your axe-hole and get out there.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Huh?
  - character: REFEREE
    dialogue: And the winner is ... Bender!
  - character: DOUBLEDEAL
    dialogue: Nice work out there, kid.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Y'know, I think I he might be dead. I took a life!
  - character: CLEARCUTTER
    dialogue: Hi, boss. Yo, dude!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, he's not dead. What's up with that?
  - character: DOUBLEDEAL
    dialogue: What, you didn't read the pamphlet? Ultimate Robot Fighting's a scam,
      kid. It's rigged.  It's a secret so keep it under your head. But the most popular
      robot always wins.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You mean I'm not a great fighter? I just won 'cause I'm popular?
  - character: DOUBLEDEAL
    dialogue: Bingo!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Woo-hoo! I'm popular!
  - character: DOUBLEDEAL
    dialogue: In fact, you're more than popular; You're pure lowest common denominator.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
  - character: REFEREE
    dialogue: Presenting Bender the Offender!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm just an ex-con trying to go straight and get my kids back.
  - character: REFEREE

  - character: REFEREE

  - character: FOREIGNER
    dialogue: I'm not from here! I have my own customs! Look at my crazy passport!
  - character: REFEREE
    dialogue: 'Versus: The Chain Smoker!'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You know, I'm also an Ultimate Robot Lover.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender! You're three hours late. You can't give up on your training
      now after both of us worked so hard.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What do you mean, "we"?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I said "us".
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, Bender the Offender doesn't need you. Bender the Offender doesn't
      need anybody!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well obviously I need floozies! Let's roll!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Howdy, chief. For my next bout, what do you say I fight these two bimbos
      in some mud?
  - character: DOUBLEDEAL
    dialogue: Actually, we've decided to go in a different direction.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What if I told your we wouldn't be fighting in the conventional sense?
  - character: DOUBLEDEAL
    dialogue: Bender, your popularity is slipping.
  - character: FOREIGNER
    dialogue: Sales of your Bender Brand French milk bath soaps are down 20%.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Those morons! I said pea berry, not sandalwood!
  - character: DOUBLEDEAL
    dialogue: Damnit, Bender! If you can't move sandalwood, you don't belong in this
      league! That's why you're gonna lose next week's title match.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But the crowd loves me.
  - character: DOUBLEDEAL
    dialogue: 'Perhaps. But let''s see how they feel about your new persona: The Gender
      Bender.'
  - character: BILLIONAIREBOT
    dialogue: You'll be the most unpopular robot fighter since Sergeant Faeces Processor.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, yeah?  Well what if I don't let the new guy win?
  - character: DOUBLEDEAL
    dialogue: 'Then he''ll just have to beat you the old-fashioned way: To death!  Melissa,
      send in the new kid.'
  - character: DESTRUCTOR
    dialogue: I am Destructor!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (squeaky) See you at the fight.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So then I said, "See you at the fight". And that's the story.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro wrestling.
      But it turns out it's fixed, like boxing.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's one thing to win a fixed fight -- there's dignity in that. But
      to lose? And in this atrocity? I can't do it! Leela, you gotta train me to win.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No way! If you wouldn't take my help when you didn't need it, why should
      I give it to you now when you do need it?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: What the hell are you talking about?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't know. But I'm not helping.
  - character: ANNOUNCER
    dialogue: You loved him as Bender the Offender! Now get ready to hate him as he
      threatens your sexuality in his new persona ... The Gender Bender!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm a real toughie!
  - character: ANNOUNCER
    dialogue: Squaring off this Sunday versus Destructor!
  - character: DESTRUCTOR
    dialogue: I will destroy you!  And stop calling me!
  - character: FNOG
    dialogue: I am Destructor's trainer, Master Fnog. My pupil will be victorious
      for he has the will of a warrior!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Not Fnog! Bender, let's hit the gym. I'm gonna teach you to fight like
      a girl!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (determined) I'll put on my tutu!
  - character: FOREMAN
    dialogue: This could be the most one-sided fight since 1973 when Ali faced an
      80-foot tall mechanical Joe Frazier. M-My memory's not what it used to be but
      I think the entire Earth was destroyed.
  - character: LITTLE
    dialogue: 'Interesting, if true. The Vegas odds tonight stand at an unprecedented
      1000-0: A bet of $0 on Bender pays $1000 if he wins. Still, very few takers.'
  - character: FOREMAN
    dialogue: It's not-not a smart bet.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: According to the script, you're supposed to prance out and tickle him
      with your fairy wand. Instead, I want you to prance out and kick his head off!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Got it. Large kickle, hold the tickle!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Thank God I'm free of that nightmare!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Sorry, buddy. Here you go!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: (monotonous) Thank you. It was cold down there on the floor.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Here, Professor, I got you a programme.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, good. Just let me put on my reading glasses.  Why, Zoidberg, there's
      a lovely photo of you in here.
  - character: REFEREE
    dialogue: 'In this corner, the confused young robot with the golden curls weighing
      525lbs: The Gender Bender!'
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Boo!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Get that hippie out of the ring!
  - character: REFEREE
    dialogue: And in these two corners, weighing 400 tons, the gizmo from Pismo ...
      Beach, Destructor!
  - character: FNOG
    dialogue: 'So, we meet again. Most amusing: Girl who acts like fighter training
      fighter who acts like girl.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Keep laughing, Fnog!  Ready, Bender?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I was born ready! Gimmie the bell! Did you hear a noise?  Final boarding
      call for flight 406, non-stop service to pain.  Now boarding standby passengers--
  - character: FOREMAN
    dialogue: This seems like as good a time as any time to bring up my new grill
      for no reason.  With its patented design, the fat drains directly into my mouth.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (weakly) Fry! Throw in the towel!  For God's sakes, Fry!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: (monotonous) That's exactly what I was thinking.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (weakly) Mommy!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, Fnog, that's enough. Call him off. Fnog?  Hmm.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Why won't anyone help me?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So, once more we meet again.
  - character: FNOG
    dialogue: Huh?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You didn't train Destructor. You're just controlling him like a puppet.
      I mean, cheating in a fake fight. That's low!
  - character: FNOG
    dialogue: Better than being a girl. Like you. You're a girl!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (ironic) Oh, right. Girls lack the will of the warrior!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Huh? It's bendering time!  Take this. And this!
  - character: FNOG
    dialogue: You were an excellent student.  Too bad I was a lousy teacher!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I think you misunderstood the concept of "bendering time"!
  - character: FNOG
    dialogue: See you in girl hell. I'll be in boy hell -- much nicer!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yes!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes!  Oh!
  - character: REFEREE
    dialogue: And the winner is Destructor!
  - character: LITTLE
    dialogue: I've not seen a spectacle of this nature in all my years impersonating
      a sportscaster.
  - character: FOREMAN
    dialogue: 'It sure was some fight. Interesting side note: As a head without a
      body, I envy the dead.'
  - character: LITTLE
    dialogue: No argument here.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender? How did the fight go? I heard somebody got flattened!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Fry, where's your Brain Slug?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Poor little guy starved to death.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm proud of you, Bender. Sure, you lost. You lost bad. But the important
      thing is I beat up someone who hurt my feelings in high school.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm in tremendous pain here.
  - character: DOUBLEDEAL
    dialogue: Great job, kid. You lost and you made it look almost half real. I want
      you to have this card good for 10% off at Bed Bath & Beyond.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes! I'm the greatest! The greatest!
  - character: LITTLE
    dialogue: And so ends the chronicle of one of the greatest ever to play the sport.
  - character: FOREMAN
    dialogue: And he didn't look half bad in the tutu.
  - character: LITTLE
    dialogue: That he did surely not.
  - character: FOREMAN

      and I'm interested in meeting a man.

    dialogue: Fry, you idiot. Ever since I was abandoned on Earth I've been searching
      for who my people are and where they come from. Then I finally meet another
      Cyclops and you blast him. You wrecked my one chance to learn who I am.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh Leela. I feel terrible. If there's anything I can ever do -  Gotcha!  I
      won! I'm the greatest!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Come on. We have worked to do.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Are you still mad at me for wrecking your once in a lifetime chance
      to learn the meaning of your existence?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No, I'm just happy you were able to win a video game. Now lets concentrate
      on getting this desperately needed popcorn to the people of Cineplex 14 OK?
  - character: VOICE
    dialogue: Leela, you've got mail.  It's not spam!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Huh?  It's him!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Kicked your ass!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Too bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn delivery.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It'll get there.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: After a whole life of searching I may finally have found where I belong.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Too bad it's a dump.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look at that statue. It's only got one eye.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Lazy sculptor!
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Welcome home Leela.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Alkazar?  Are you real? Or am I seeing single?
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Ow! Of course I'm real!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: After all this time. Somebody else with one eye who isn't a clumsy carpenter
      or, uh, a kid with a BB gun.
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: It's alright Leela. You'll never be alone again.  Let me introduce you
      to yourself.  Do you mind if your servants walk?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Not at all!
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: We are the last remaining Cyclopses. Our planet is Cyclopia. This is
      our capital, Cyclops City. Stop me if I'm going too fast for you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: There's so much information and yet somehow I feel as if I know it all
      already.
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: This sacred mosaic depicts our goddess of beauty.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hmm, you got any sacred artwork of her from the back?
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Her perfect eye reminds me of yours Leela. Had our race survived, you
      would have been a temple priestess or a supermodel.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh please! Really?
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: And there's the pirate Purple Beard, scourge of the six seas.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's over that hill?
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: The Forbidden Valley. A holy sancturary where no one may tread.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Is that anything like a cemetary 'cause I gotta take a leak.  Ow!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, that's offensive to our people. Isn't it?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: This is my home. I hope you don't think less of me because I live in
      a giant castle.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh no not at all. If anything, I'm more impressed.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ooo! I'm gonna need to make some room!
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: In here's where I dream my lonely dreams and cook my simple meals.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's all so sad. What happened to our people?
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Its too painful to speak of now. Come, I'll show you your quarters.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ow!  Ow!  Ow!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I heard you from my room. What's wrong?
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: It's just - no Leela. I don't want to see tears in your perfect eye.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Please, is it bout the fate of our people? Because I'm very interested
      in that.
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Well OK. But it's chilly and you're going to be all wet from the tears.
      Let's go into my chamber.
  - character: CYCLOPIAN
    dialogue: How far away do you think it is?
  - character: SCIENTIST
    dialogue: A trillion miles?
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Things got hot. You look a little hot, you can take off that jacket.  Our
      people don't like to be hot. Anyway, just before the impact...
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Alkazar, I used to be a baby, it might have been me!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's so tragic.
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Yes, but the real tragedy is that our race ends with us.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It doesn't have to.
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: What do you mean?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You're a male and I'm a female.
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: I'm still not following you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wake up my king.
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Oh jeez what a night. Make me some coffee would you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, sure OK. What do you take with that?
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Pancakes and sausage. Kitchen's in the basement, pans are in the attic.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Maybe after breakfast we can talk about rebuilding our civilisation.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Mmm! Great pancakes Leela!
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Yeah they'll come in handy if I need to cover any tiny manholes.  Listen
      hun, we don't want to look like slobs in front of the other species do we?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No.
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: So get to work on these dishes. And then organise my collection of naked
      celebrity photos by name and what you can see.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look Alkazar.
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Call me Al.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look Al. I know you've been living alone a long time and I can sympathise
      but I'm not your maid.
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: You're right, I'm sorry. It looks like the relationshipisn't going to
      work afterall. So much for the Cyclops race. I thought it was a pretty good
      race but -
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK OK, I'll do the dishes.  Hey where'd they go?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'Ah, Leela''s experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel: Worshipping
      some lowlife jerk.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: He may be some lowlife jerk but I don't trust him. I think he's hiding
      something and I'm gonna find out what it is.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Try and stop me!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Al? I did my hair the way you wanted it.  Who are these people?
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Friends.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey, where'd you get this couch and that TV set and all this stuff?
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: They were giving it away on the street corner. Just like you Leela.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'Too bad they weren''t giving away the three things you actually need:
      Mouthwash, a back wax and stain-proof underwear.'
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: By the way your pal Fry fell into the dungeon. Feed him a taco so he
      doesn't die and stink up the place.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Come on Al, can't you let the little guy out?
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Jeez Leela, twice in one day? I'm not Superman!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Why were you sneaking into my people's forbidden valley?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: '''Cause I think Alkazar''s hding something. Listen Leela, you may not
      like it, you may not believe it, you may not wanna hear it but Alkazar''s a
      jerk, he''s bad for you. He -'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I know.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You do?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry if it's obvious to you with your learning disability then of course
      it's obvious to me! He's crude and gross and he treats me like a slave.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Then dump his one eyed ass.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I can't. If I leave Alkazar then that's the end of the Cyclops race.
      And I won't let that happen. Even if that means a lifetime of unhappiness.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'll break up with him at dinner.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'll be there.
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Yo Leela, what gives? Pig says your slop tastes like crap.
  - character: PIG
    dialogue: Yeah, like crap.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: C'mon Leela you deserve better than this guy! Dump him already!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm trying.
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Hey everyone jam a sock in your spit faucets.  Not long ago I spent
      my lonely nights renting slash flicks with Rat Man and his girlfriend. But then
      a beautiful woman arrived and - stop eating pig! And she brought new hope for
      me and our once great civilisation. Now a million centuries of Cyclops destiny
      depend on the answer to one question......Leela, will you marry me?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yes! I Will!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ohh!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Congratulations Leela!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Hello!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Oh this is great!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Pst, Leela. you've got to get me out of here. It's horrible, eating
      scraps, letting my waste drop wherever it falls like an animal in the zoo.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Animals go in the corner.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: The corner! Why didn't I think of that?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look Fry I'd like to help you but it's my wedding and I'm kind of busy.  Here,
      try to be happy for me. That way at least one of us will be.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's it! It's time for this bird to walk.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender come on. We've got to get some dirt on Alkazar. Lets go and find
      out what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh no thanks I'm good.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I don't know Fry. For the first time in my life I feel like I've stolen
      enough.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender, snap out of it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Sorry I don't know what came over me. Let's go.  (singing) I love stealing,
      I love taking things!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Come on boy, jump!  Good boy!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa Mittens!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: My God! Four identical castles!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Each more identical than the last!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's weird. It's another Cyclops, only this one has five eyes.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And here's another one with no eyes.
  - character: PREACHERBOT
    dialogue: Does anyone have a reason why this couple shall not be joined in the
      irrevocable shackles of holy bliss?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Saving a race of one-eyed monsters? Who could object to that?
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Cut to the chase Preach!
  - character: PREACHERBOT
    dialogue: Do you Alkazar......takethiswomanbeforeyou...tolove..insickness..do
      you part?
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Yeah sure I do come on faster!
  - character: PREACHERBOT
    dialogue: Do you Leela, copy and paste his response til death do you part?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I..d -
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh my God!
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: What the?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey Alkazar, you left somebody off the guest list.
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: It, uh, oo!  Uh, hey sweetie, just go back to the castle and wait for
      me. She, she's nuts, I can morph into a 5-eyed alien and I kinda said I'd marry
      her. But I'm really a Cyclops and I'm really going to marry you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh yeah? Then what about this?
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: This is a bit awkward.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Who's she?
  - character: SANDY
    dialogue: Who are they?
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Go back to the castle Sandy.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And maybe you'd like to meet her.  And her.
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Leela, this must all be ver confusing.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: A little. That's why I've decided to hurt you until you explain it.
  - character: SANDY
    dialogue: Show us your real form!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah!
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Well, this is the real me. But I can explain. We all have needs. Mine
      was to make it with five weirdos and have them scrub my five castles. I gave
      you all what you wanted and of course I made a few bucks letting Pig watch through
      the two way mirror. Can any of you sa you wouldn't have done the exact same
      thing in my position?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But why did you have all five weddings on the same day?
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: Hey lady, you got any idea how much it costs to rent a tux that changes
      shape?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Alright Alkazar, I just have one last question for you.
  - character: ALKAZAR
    dialogue: What's that?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: If you can change form, why didn't you change it in the one place that
      counts?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thanks for saving me from that creep Fry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, that's what I do.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I guess I was so desperate to find out who I really was, I forgot who
      I really was.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No harm done. In the many decades you'll work to repay me for that shipment
      of popcorn you destroyed, you'll have plenty of time to search for your true
      home.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah. I mean, how many planets can there be?

  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Finally, the last form of the day. Welcome to stampy-town. Population
      - five! And now for the finishing touch.  Ah, the cycle of bureaucracy.  Sweet
      gorilla of Manila! A letter from the Central Bureaucracy!  (reading) Attention
      Hermes Conrad, you are about to recieve a letter from the Central Bureaucracy.  My
      God! It's from the Central Bureaucracy!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm having a poker game tonight with some friends from my old cryogenics
      job. You guys interested?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I don't know. I only gamble with chumps.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'll play.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm in.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Leela, Fry, robot. No matter what it is you're doing tonight, I'm available.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We're playing poker. but I'm warning you, my friends are serious players.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Bah, big shots. I say let the dice do the talking.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow, you look happy. Is someone fired?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Better. The Central Bureaucracy is conducting an inspection tomorrow.
      I'll finally be promoted to grade 35, the 35th highest grade there is.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hermes, wait! We're having a poker party. Stay and whip off a batch
      of your famous jerk dip.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Sorry. I spent all day putting my office in order. Now I got to go home
      and relax the traditional Jamaican way - a glass of warm milk and good night
      sleep.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Jamaican? I thought you were some kinda outer space potato man.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Ah that must be my old boss.
  - character: IPGEE
    dialogue: Hello Leela, you're fired.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I know.
  - character: IPGEE
    dialogue: I'm sorry but it's just that you're over a year late for work at this
      point.
  - character: IPGEE
    dialogue: So I told Leela, "Your request for a date is most flattering but I must
      decline." These office romances never work out. Afterall, that is how I met
      my horrible wife.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But you never wore your ring. I didn't know you had a wife.
  - character: IPGEE
    dialogue: And my wife doesn't know I have a job. I keep my personal and professional
      lives serparate.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: C'mon, let's deal. You'll have plenty of time to talk when you're poor.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's with the specs Bender?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: They're my lucky shades. I stole them off some lucky guy while his lucky
      seeing eye dog was taking a whiz.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I can't spell anything with these cards.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Finally, I have a good claw. See?  Three human females, a number and
      a king giving himself brain surgery.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It doesn't matter how many human females you have, Bender's on a hot
      streak.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, what can I say? Must be my lucky shades!  Nothing, nothing, crap,
      crap, garbage.  Read 'em and leak saltwater!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh man!
  - character: TERRY
    dialogue: My baby's milk money!
  - character: IPGEE
    dialogue: Oh I am broke. What will I tell my horrible wife?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: If I were you I'd be more worried about that tapeworm going to town
      on your intestines.
  - character: IPGEE
    dialogue: Let me see those glasses.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Um...uh...
  - character: IPGEE
    dialogue: Oh my various gods! X-Ray specs!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Guys, I swear those are prescription. I need them for reading stuff
      - on the other side of stuff.
  - character: LOU
    dialogue: Cheater!
  - character: IPGEE
    dialogue: Get him!
  - character: TERRY
    dialogue: Break his neck!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: No don't hurt him! He's my best friend!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Great cow of Moscow!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Oh! I'll never pass inspection now! They'll bust me lower than a limbo
      stick - at carnival time.  (crying) And that's as low as limbo sticks get.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aw hey c'mon don't worry. We'll watch you clean up.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: It's too late. The inspector will be here in exactly one second.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Who the hell are you?
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: Morgan Proctor, bureaucrat grade 19.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Hermes Conrad, bureaucrat grade 36.
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: Enough friendly banter. Shall we begin the inspection?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: This way please.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Outta my way wife...!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: '...I wasn''t cut out to be a bureaucrat anyway. I''m only anal 78.36%
      of the time. I''m not worthy to stamp a form. So I''ll stamp the pavement with
      my flabby body.'
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Life. Death. Either way I'm demoted to a tiny cubicle.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Sweet something of...of someplace.
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: As your superior I hereby relieve you of duty. Consider yourself on
      paid vacation.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Oh! The ultimate penalty.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I recommend the health cure on Spa 5, the sauna planet. Here, read.
  - character: LABARBARA
    dialogue: Spa 5? Is it good?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Oh, it's wonderful! I don't know anything about it but they send me
      a bucket of krill for every patient I send.
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: Naturally I'll have to assign a bureaucrat to fill in for Hermes while
      he's away. I assign me, I accept, welcome aboard.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Then it's settled. Hermes will relax and Zoidberg will eat! Hurrah!
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: I've been reviewing your corporate records. Regarding last Monday's
      delivery, why did it take twice as long as scheduled?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry got his head stuck in a crater.
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: And during this period of head-crater interaction, what were you doing?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Martini drinking contests with the autopilot. I would've had him this
      time but we ran out of olives.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I can explain.
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: You really think you can explain how you left port without a full compliment
      of olives? I think not.
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: Locker check!
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: Why isn't this jacket in alphabetical order?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What?
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: The zipper. It should be at the bottom.
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: I - I've never seen anything like this. Why is there yoghurt in this
      cap?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, I can explain that. See, it used to be milk and, well, time makes
      fools of us all.
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: You are all dismissed. Fry, I will speak to you alone.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh wait, this is the other Fry's locker. I'm Phry with a "Ph."
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What the hell's going on? I thought you were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: I'm surrounded by neat freaks everyday. There's nothing kinkier to me
      than a filthy slop-jock like you!
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: Now listen you filthy pig. No-one can know about us. If anyone asks
      I'll deny it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Just like very other girl I've dated.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Curse that Dr Zoidberg! If I get out of here, he'll be looking down
      the business end of a shrimp fork!
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: '...and for those six and a half reasons, I am demoting Leela to co-pilot.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Co-pilot? Under who?
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: The autopilot.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That drunk?!
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: Mr Bender you are now in charge of co-ordinating the Professor's bodily
      functions.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That's a full time job.
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: And Fry, as for you, I am promoting you to executive delivery boy. You
      will no longer go on deliveries and you will have your own office next to mine.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: All right!
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: Mr Bender would you high five him so we can continue this meeting?  And
      on the rebound?  Meeting adjourned.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I can't figure why she's so nice to you Fry.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: She's a hateful monster this Morgan. She scolded and hit me. I tell
      you she's risking my friendship with her.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, what happened to you?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Morgan made me walk the Professor. There we were in the park when suddenly
      some old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked the Professor at her but she
      kept on coming. So had to hit her with this purse I found. Ah, the point is
      it's Morgan's fault. That pencil pushing scazwag.  Why if she were here I'd
      - Uh oh is she behind me?
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: No. I'm in front of you!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Morgan? It's 3am.
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: I know. A skunk knocked over my garbage and suddenly all I could think
      of was you.  My God, it's so...repulsive. So uh, this is where you eat?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Eat and sleep.
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: Oh Fry!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh wait, Bender's my rooommate. He could be back any second.
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: Not likely. I ordered him to flush out the Professor's earwax.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey Fry, I made you a candle with - What the?  Oh now I see! Now I get
      it. Now the pieces are falling into place. The office, the promotion, that dwarf
      in my book club who steals my opinions.  It's all coming together now!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I must say this opens my eyes! Another case closed my dear Watson.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Morgan, come back! He's stuck in a loop!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: For I was blind but now I see!
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: Mr Bender about last night. that was just a...a misunderstanding.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh you didn't understand? Well let me explain. You......were having
      sex with you.
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: No. You see, a bureaucrat of my rank isn't supposed to fraternize.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's what makes it so juicy. Its the forbidden fruit angle everybody
      loves. First I'll say "You'll never guess who saw Fry and Morgan doing it!"
      and they'll say "Who Bender, who?" and I'll say "It was lovable......old Bender."
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, what did you do to him?
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: I downloaded his brain. Everything that is Bender is right here. His
      mind, his memories, his in-your-face interface.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But, but...Bender need brain...for...smart making!  What did you do
      now? Stop doing things!
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: I sent the disk to be filed at the Central Bureaucracy. I did what I
      had to do Fry. He was a bad robot.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, he was a bad friend. I want him back right now.
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: Then you should have filed a request 20 years ago.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy.
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: Dirty boy! Dirty boy!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You and Morgan were having an affair?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I couldn't help it. She loved me because of the part of me that's a
      slob and I loved her because of the part of me that's desperate.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Poor Bender. Without his brain he's become all quiet and helpful. We've
      got to go to the Central Bureaucracy and get that disk back!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Yeah!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh yes we must, yes.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Why?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, those arguments aside, we're still going.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You can't just waltz into the Central Bureaucracy. It's a tangled web
      of red tape and regulations. I've never been but a friend of mine went completely
      mad trying to find the washroom there.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Then we'll need a guide. Someone who's been there before.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh I've been there. Lot's of times!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Look at that. The carts go out full but they come in empty. It's criminally
      inefficient.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: But don't you see? They could increase efficiency 4% if they used the
      empty carts to haul in heavy mining machinery.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Man, how long is this gonna take?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well it doesn't look like I'll make it inside with the rest of you.
      Uh but good luck. Just leave me where I drop.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Come on, I have a better idea.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Excuse me? We're from the Planet Express delivery company. We're here
      to deliver a robot.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: While you're crashing, could you tell us where all these canisters end
      up?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: OK.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: OK thanks.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Wonderful.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Where is it?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We're getting nowhere slowly. Here, I'll address this to the Central
      Filing room.  Then we'll track it using my wrist-lojack-amater.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This is it. We'll just run in, grab Bender's disk and run out. Got it?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We'll never find that disk will we Bender?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You're right. Nothing is over so long as there's one thin ray of hope.
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: Lost something?  I should have known you'd come here rather than follow
      proper procedure. And I did know. And that's why I came here.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Listen Morgan, We're through, you're an evil heartless woman and I never
      wanna see you again. However would you help us get Bender back for old times
      sake?
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: I'm afraid he's lost in the master in pile. And it would take some sort
      of giant mechanical atomic powered sorting machine to find him.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: You rang?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Dammit Hermes, just jump already. Stop hogging that healthy liver.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: No, I want to live. Organising that forced labour spa rekindled my lifelong
      love of bureaucracy.
  - character: LABARBARA
    dialogue: My Hermes got that hellhole running so efficiently that all the physical
      labour is now done by a single Australian man.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But how did you know we were here?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Dr Zoidberg brought us.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: It was me, I'm the hero!
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: Number 1.0.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Number 1.0, I hereby petition you for an emergency sort-and-file, under
      regulation 2 point -
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Sir please, I must located the disk with my friend's brain on it.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's only four minutes from now.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Requisition me a beat.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Just the bureaucrats, Jamaica!
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: Jamaica.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm Bender baby, please insert liquor!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Congratulations.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: That's OK Hermes. At least we have you back.
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: Not yet you don't. I'm still acting bureaucrat of Planet Express. And
      I have some changes to make. First, Fry, you're fired. Second -
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: 'Not so fast! When I was sortin'' I came upon a certain document filed
      by one Morgan Proctor.  Form B: Notification Of Romantic Entanglement.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's right, she fraternized me!
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: That form isn't about you. It refers to my high school prom date. It
      was a regulation date that ended in regulation disappointment.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Yes but you only stamped it four times!
  - character: MORGAN
    dialogue: No! No! I was young and reckless.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well, it looks like I'll be needing my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely
      reduced pay of course.
  - character: LABARBARA
    dialogue: It's better than nothing!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What about me? Can I come back at severely reduced pay?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: You got it mon! In fact, severely reduced pay all around!  Come on wife,
      let's blow this joint!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Now it's time for my song! (singing) When I was two there was a tidal
      wave in -

  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good news everyone, the university is bringing me up on disciplinary
      charges! Wait, that's not good news at all.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Whatever you did Professor, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes but they won't listen. Everyone's always in favour of saving Hitler's
      brain but when you put it in the body of a great white shark (sarcastic) ooo,
      suddenly you've gone too far.
  - character: VERNON
    dialogue: Professor Farnsworth, do you know why we've called you here today?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Listen to me you pompous frauds, if I'm going down, I'm taking you all
      with me. Dean Vernon, I know the truth. It was you driving your hover-car that
      night, not your horse. Dean Epsilon, I know all about your "Department Of Pool
      Boy Studies." And Dr Wernstrom...Werrrnstrom!
  - character: VERNON
    dialogue: Actually Professor, we merely called you here to say......surprise.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Surprise!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: And you Coach Smalley, or should I say "Coach hairpiece"?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No Professor, it's a surprise party for your 150th birthday.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (muttering) Hundred and...what? Oooh!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'Good evening I''m -  Whoa, sorry. I''m Bender and I''ll be MC-ing this
      roast. Y''know, they say you can judge a man by the company he keeps, so here''s
      the Professor''s oldest friend: A grotesque, stinking lobster!'
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Good evening ladies and germs.  That wasn't a joke, I was talking to
      Dean Streptococcus.  Now I'm not saying Professor Farnsworth is old, but if
      you consider his age he's likely to die soon!  Hey Ringo, that was the joke.
      Oh, it's showtime at the Apollo all over again.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Where would the Professor be without students who love and respect him?
      Right there!  But seriously, of all the former crew members of the Professor's
      delivery ship, our next speaker is by far the most alive. Captain Muskie?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I wouldn't wanna follow that guy!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And now, a man who needs no introduction. (whispering) Fry, get up there!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh.  Thank you. Y'know, when I was first asked to make a film about
      my nephew, Professor Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later Leela
      made the film. But if I had made the film, you could bet there would have been
      a lot more topless women on motorcycles! Roll film!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) Dork alert!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: How 'bout a few words Professor?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Eh wha?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I said "words."
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Uh, what a pleasure it is to see my lifetime of accomplishments summed
      up in a 3-minute film. My best years are behind me. So much left undone. So
      little time.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Funny funny stuff.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: My life is over.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No it isn't. You have another 10 years left.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela! He could live another 100 years!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No, he couldn't. When you turn 160, robots from the Sunset Squad take
      you to a mysterious planet and you never return.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow, a whole planet of old people. Where is it?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (spookily) Nobody knows!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: So many loves half-loved. So many inventions half-invented. That damn
      time machine alone set me back 15 years.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: If only it'd worked. You could go back and not waste your time on it.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: There's no one to carry on after I'm gone. No one to take care of my
      work and my research and my fabulous fortune. By God, that's it! I've got to
      name a successor.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: A successor?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: A successor to the Professor?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: There's no time to lose. I'm off to my lab to build a successor-naming
      machine!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Man, the Professor's been in his lab for days.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I hope he didn't die. Unless he left a note naming me his successor.
      Then I hope he did die.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: You? The successor? Over my empty shell! The Professor will pick me.
      Only I have his lobster-like tenacity!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Up yours Zoidberg. Up wherever your species traditionally crams things.
      The only successful way to choose a successor is with a limbo contest.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Kingston rules. Two men go down, one come up.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look, the Professor trusts me with a giant spaceship. He wouldn't trust
      the rest of you with his dentures.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Yesh he would.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sorry everyone but need I remind you? Blood is thicker than water.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Everyone, I have a very dramatic announcement. So anyone with a weak
      heart should leave now. Goodbye.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, Professor?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh yes, the announcement! As you all know, I am not long for this world...
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yes, we know.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: True mon!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Buh!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: One foot in the grave.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: '...So I''ve picked my successor. It''s someone in whom I have great
      faith - even though his mind is undeveloped and he''s accomplished nothing.  My
      closest living relative...'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh yeah!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: My clone, Cubert Farnsworth.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: He's horrible!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Crud. Can I at least be in charge of your dentures?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You wish!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Where did Cubert come from?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: 12 years ago I began the cloning process by removing some skin cells
      from one of the shaplier growths on my back.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait, if he's your clone then why doesn't his nose look like yours?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I left him in his first tube too long and he got squished up against
      the side.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Is he dumb or just ugly?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Let's find out.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: What? You've never seen a genius's wiener before?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: No.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Never.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, once in the park.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Mmm!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: As long as I'm going to be in charge here, let me examine my so called
      "crew," if it can so be called. First of all, Dr Zoidberg, do you even have
      a medical degree?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I lost it...in a volcano.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: And why do we need a bending robot around here anyway? What possible
      use do we have for you?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh...me no speaka the English.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: And why does our space pilot have only one eye? There's someone I'd
      like you to meet. His name is depth perception!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Why you little -!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Wow, that hurt - the air!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Im pending para un bending!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh Cubert, come in here. I have something amazing to show you.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: What is it? A compitent employee? I doubt that very much!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Little twerp.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aye chihuahua!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: As my successor I'm trusting you to carry on my work. These are just
      some of the half finished inventions you'll spend your life finishing.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: I didn't realise you were the inventor of the junk heap.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That's my prizewinning smelloscope. If a dog craps anywhere in the universe,
      you can bet I won't be out of the loop. And this is my universal translator.
      Unfortunately so far it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Hello.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Crazy gibberish!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Don't you have any worthwhile inventions?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Why certainly. Step over here.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: These are the dark matter engine I invented. They allow my starship
      to travel between galaxies in mere hours.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: That's impossible. You can't go faster than the speed of light.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Of course not. That's why scientists increased the speed of light in
      2208.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Also impossible.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: And what makes my engines truly remarkable is the afterburner which
      delivers 200% fuel efficiency.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: That's especially impossible.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Not at all. It's very simple.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Then explain it.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Now that's impossible. It came to me in a dream and I forgot it in another
      dream.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Your explainations are pure weapons grade balognium. It's all impossible.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Nothing is impossible. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being
      is a scientist is all about.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: No, that's what being a magical elf is all about.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh my God, oh my God! It's Elzar, the TV chef! Oh kill me now people!
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: How we doing here?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh Elzar, everything's so good!
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: What are you, an ass kissing machine?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes sir, good one sir!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh it's a gem of an evening! I feel so wonderful having someone to take
      over my life work! And it's all thanks to Cubert.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Look Professor. I may be identical to you in every possible way but
      that doesn't mean I'm anything like you.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You...wha?
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: I don't want to be an inventor. I want to be something useful like a
      teacher's aide or a prison guard or a science fiction cartoon writer.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: But-But what about my hopes and my dreams and my wonderful inventions?
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: In your entire life your only half-decent invention was me and I didn't
      turn out like you wanted either.
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: You folks still doing alright?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh yes Elzar.
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Good 'cause it turns out I forgot to cook that chicken.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Bad news everyone. By the time you watch this tape, I'll be gone. Leaving
      by nothing but a history of failure and my original hipbones. You see, I've
      been lying about my age. I'm not actually 150. I'm 160. Oh vanity, thy name
      is Professor Farnsworth. And now that I've nothing to live for, I've alerted
      the Sunset Squad robots to take me away.
  - character: FARNSWORTH

      lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin......and the cute

    dialogue: What?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Oh no!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Oh.

    dialogue: (unmoved) Well, life goes on. Except for you!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You bastard!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We've gotta get him back.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Impossible. No one knows where they take those old geezers.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Nothing is impossible. You'd know that if you really took after the
      Professor, like I do.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: You're his uncle dummy, he takes after you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh...what?
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Wait a second, that means I also take after you!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Quiet. I think I know how to find the Professor.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Lay it on us big boots.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: If the smelloscope can pick up the Professor's odour, we may have a
      chance to save him.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: I think not. As you probably already don't know, odours are made up
      of particles that can't travel through the vacuum of space.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm zeroing in on him.  Bengay...mothballs......letters to the editor.
      It's the Professor!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: To the flying machine!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: To the left!  No to the up!  U-turn, U-turn!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: We'll never find this place. Robots are very good at keeping secrets.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No we're not you little bed wetter. Oops I'm sorry.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: There it is! The Near-Death Star!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, we'll tell them the Professor escaped and we're bringing him back.
      Fry, you'll have to dress up like a 160 year old man.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm on it!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: (sarcastic) My God, the illusion is so perfect I almost forgot I was
      looking at an idiot!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Now they may ask for a DNA sample.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'd like to see them find it!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: This is impossible, we don't even hae a sample of the Professor's DNA.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I think I know where to get some.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Why do I have to be the hump?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: '''Cause you''re too ugly to be a wart.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Your medicare dollars at work.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, this is Professor Hubert Farnsworth. He escaped.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What? I'm old. Listen. (old man voice) Hey you kids, get off the lawn!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Got a hot steaming batch right here!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Eh, keep the change buddy.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Stupid robot.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh....I-I've got talking hump syndrome.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Sounds nice.

    dialogue: So this is where they stick old people. It's horrific.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: At least it keeps them from driving.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Brace yourself for the worst.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And yet he looks so natural.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: What's happening?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: He's hooked up to a life-support system. We have to disconnect him very
      very carefully, or the shock could kill him.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We're probably going to make it, but we might not.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: It's impossible, we'll never fit.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Will too.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Told you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Come on Leela, step your big boot down on the gas pedal.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: They've blown out one of our engines!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it! Fix it fix it fix it!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Only the Professor knows how to fix it. We have to wake him up.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Try shocking him.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Your social security cheque is late! Stuff costs more than
      it used to. Young people use curse words!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Damnit, we'll have to fix the engine ourself.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We can't you bastard, no one knows how it works. It's impossible.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Nothing is impossible. I understand how the engines work now. It came
      to me in a dream.  The engines don't move the ship at all. The ship stays where
      it is and the engines move the universe around it.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's a complete load.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Nothing's a complete load. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being
      a scientist is all about. Right Professor?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Eh...whuh...
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Let's ride!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Good news everyone, he's made a complete recovery.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Yeah!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Wow!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: All right!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I'm as spry as a 140 year old.  See? I only broke one ankle.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So what were they doing to you in that awful drawer?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, they had me hooked up to a bizarre virtual world that seemed absolutely
      real.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: What was it like?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It was as though I was living in a facility in Florida with hundreds
      of other old people. All day long we'd play bingo, eat oatmeal and wait for
      our children to call.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's a hundred times more horrible than anything I could imagine.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh my yes. Thank you all for saving me. Especially you my little clone.
      No matter what you decide to do with your life, I'm still proud of you.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: I've already decided. Dad, when I grow up I wanna be just like you.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Don't worry son. You will. Incidentally, you might want to read up on
      a condition known as "wandering bladder."
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Why?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No reason. No reason at all.

  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Exciting news, people! The pet licence I requsitioned for Nibbler has
      arrived.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know you cared about Nibbler.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Dream on, woman. I'd like to put the little bastard in a sack and toss
      the sack in a river and hurl the river into space. But I do like filling out
      requisitions and these were some doozies!  Great Jah's dreadlocks! There's been
      a mix-up. This isn't a pet licence, it's a fishing licence. And it's mandatory!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic Ocean. This seems the logical place
      for fish to congregate.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So we're in international waters?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Indeed so.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Falcon, this is Blue Raven, the goose has nested. Repeat, the goose
      has nested. Hey, guess what you're accessories to?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: The sun, the sea air, good friends.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Leela's right, fishing blows. Whattya say we make it interesting?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Why not?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Yeah.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yeah, cool.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Everybody kick in five bucks.  There, wasn't that interesting?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This contest is as good as over. I once caught a fish this big.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this big!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm afraid you're both out of your league, boys, 'cause you're looking
      at a woman who owns her own harpoon.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Harpoon, my ass!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Let's see now, which bait to use?  Crickets? Squid? Chicken necks?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Excuse me, if I might be so bold, I'm willing to offer my services as
      a bait critic.  These sardines for example are bland and tasteless.  And these
      dry, stringy nightcrawlers, though juicy ...  ... very very juicy--
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: I don't believe this! It's eating my bait!  Beat it, you mooching crawdad!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided fishing rod.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) Quiet, Bender, you're scaring away the fish.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fine. I'll head over to the other side. (shouting) Good luck fishing
      on this side!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: A shrimp?  I find it a bit hard to believe that--
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Aha!  Gather round, chumps! I got the winner!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh, so this is where you shop for your boots?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Couple more of those and you'll have yourself a fish stick!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish nugget-style chunklet. And anyway,
      it's bigger than anything you've caught. Ow! My small intestine!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times heavier than a boot.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You'll never catch anything with that primitive technology. What you
      need is this fish pheromone.  The most potent aphrodisiac known to fishkind.  Uh-oh!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (sexfully) I'm so into you!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, my!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) Hey, Bender, I just caught a fish this big!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this! If I'm not gonna catch a fish,
      I might as well not catch a big fish.  There. Like most of life's problems this
      one can be solved with bending.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Bender, be careful. That's the ships diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Then why do I have to be careful?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It belonged to my grandmother.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: My manwich!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wake up, everyone! I've got something. And this time it's alive!  Dr.
      Zoidberg, since when do you even wear boots?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I wasn't wearing it. (ashamed) I was eating it.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Come on, let's go home.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Sunburn! My fabulous body! It's ruined! What happened to my parasol?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I don't know. It wasn't here when I took your umbrella.  What? I put
      sunblock on you.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Well it didn't work!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and let's go.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, I'm snagged.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It's not snagged, the mechano man has caught something!  Sweet Zombie
      Jesus! It's huge!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: It's coming up!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Oh, that's big!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: A colossal-mouth bass!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's diving!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's pulling us under! Everyone into the ship!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Wait! I'll save us! By cutting the unbreakable diamond filament!  Well,
      at least I'll die with my friends. Hello?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: (from ship) My Speedos!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Depth at 45 hundred feet, 48 hundred, 50 hundred! 5000 feet!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Dear Lord, that's over 150 atmospheres of pressure.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: How many atmospheres can this ship withstand?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well it's a spaceship, so I'd say anywhere between zero and one.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What's that? Is someone bending girders?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We'll be crushed if we don't equalise the pressure.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: How do we do that?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That should do it.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: We're all gonna die!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait, I'll be back in a minute.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You did it, Fry!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Did what?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: People, it's far far worse than we thought; My fish got away.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: There, good as new! Except we're three miles below the surface, we don't
      have any food and the ship won't work underwater.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (restrained) Tempers are wearing thin. Let's just hope some robot doesn't
      kill everybody.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: The important thing is that we don't panic. There are rules for situations
      like this.  Now, the first order of business is lunch. I suggest a nice lobster
      Zoidberg, I mean lobster Newburg, I mean Doctor Zoidberg.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, everyone, calm down. The Professor and I will get to work on the
      ship. Bender, Zoidberg, since you can survive underwater, you'll go out and
      look for food.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'd better go too. They don't know what I like.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Fry, no! The pressure will crush you like a green snake under a sugarcane
      truck.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Not necessarily. This is chance for Fry to test out my experimental
      anti-pressure pill.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I can't swallow that.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well then good news! It's a suppository.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: How are you doing there, Fry?  Glad to hear it.  Aha!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aw, yeah!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Yum, yum, yum!  Uh-oh!  Look at me, I'm Dr. Zoidberg, homeowner!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Careful, Fry, I think that flag might be poisonous.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty grub.  Arr! The laws o' science
      be a harsh mistress!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Say, robot, old buddy? Could you help me move a couch?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: What is it, Fry?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (blubberling) Mermaid.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You want some lemonade? You saw a big parade?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Your student loans have been repaid? Then how 'bout lending your old
      pal Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr Millionaire!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, swallow your food. Then talk.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: A mermaid!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You think you saw a mermaid?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing a tube top and she had a beautiful
      scaley tail. And I think she had hair extensions.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, right!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Sure she did.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: OK, Fry!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You're simply hallucinating, you ... moron.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's so far-fetched about mermaids? I mean, there's all sorts of weird
      sea creatures here in the future. Like Dr. Zoidberg.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean madness.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Every time something good happens to me you say it's some kind of madness,
      or I'm drunk, or I ate too much candy. Well I saw a real mermaid and I wish
      for once my friends would have decency and kindness to believe me.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (whispering) Ocean madness.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: He may have ocean madness but that's no excuse for ocean rudeness.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (muttering) Ocean madness, yeah right. It's always something, ain't
      it?  (talking) It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here! Wake up!  Oh! oxygen!
  - character: MERMAID
    dialogue: Here you go, darlin'.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey! I can breath and talk, just like a fish!
  - character: MERMAID
    dialogue: Oh, you speak fish?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What?
  - character: MERMAID
    dialogue: I'm sorry, my accent's atrocious. Hi, my name's Umbriel!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?
  - character: UMBRIEL
    dialogue: Course not. Just stay calm and let the currents relax your every muscle.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aw, yeah!
  - character: UMBRIEL
    dialogue: Did it just get warmer?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I can't believe you're really real. I like your tail.
  - character: UMBRIEL
    dialogue: Oh, you're sweet. I like those wiggly doo-dads comin' outta your hips.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, Thanks. They're called pants.
  - character: UMBRIEL
    dialogue: This here's a volcanic vent. The water comes out at over 4000 degrees.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No kidding.
  - character: UMBRIEL
    dialogue: Did it just get colder?  Tell me more about that bizarre land-y world
      you come from. Is there water there too?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sure, sometimes it falls from the sky.
  - character: UMBRIEL
    dialogue: Hm.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And sometimes it doesn't.
  - character: UMBRIEL
    dialogue: Oh, Mr. Fry! You do go on!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You know what I like best about you, Umbriel? You find me fascinating
      even when I'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer.
  - character: UMBRIEL
    dialogue: Lions? There are sealions on the land?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yup. We call them land-sealions ... I tame them!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: "I'm almost finish reconfiguring the ships propulsion system. We can\
      \ leave as soon as the paper-m\xE2ch\xE9 is dry."
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Where's Fry?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I didn't kill him. Professor?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No, I've been busy.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: He must've gone out looking for that mermaid. The poor demented honky.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's ocean madness alright. Sailors call it aqua dementia, the deep
      down crazies, the wet willies, the screaming moist!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: We'll form a search party. Now, we'll need oxygen.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I got it covered.  In the event of an emergency, my ass can be used
      as a floatation device.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: 'Ooh, that reminds me: You''ve all taken your pressure pills, right?'
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Yes! Stop asking!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I've got his scent! Over here where the water gets warmer. This way!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (awestruck) Bend me!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Dude! An ancient sunken city!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Could it possibly be? Are the old legends true?  It is! It's the fabled
      lost city of Atlanta!
  - character: MERMAN
    dialogue: Howdy, y'all!
  - character: COLONEL
    dialogue: Welcome to Atlanta. Folks round these parts call me the Colonel.  Here,
      have some breathers, courtesy of our Chamber of Commerce.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: This is uncomfortable and humiliating. Now, if they could put it in
      the form of a suppository.
  - character: COLONEL
    dialogue: Y'all enjoy your stay! Tourism's our main source of income round here
      so see the sights, spend some money. Please don't leave!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still alive! (whispering) I owe you 10
      bucks, Hermes!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, you guys, the most amazing thing happened. It's two-for-one Tuesday
      at Krispy Kreme! Plus there's mermaids.
  - character: COLONEL
    dialogue: Nice out of town folks, I'd like you to meet my daughter, Umbriel. Umbriel,
      these are some Yankees.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: So, Fry, Atlanta was an American city in your time?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I think it was just an airport. They had a place where you could buy
      nuts.
  - character: UMBRIEL
    dialogue: No! Ancient Atlanta was more than just a Delta hub. It was a vibrant
      metropolis, the equal of Paris or New York.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's right, honey! Whatever you say.
  - character: UMBRIEL
    dialogue: Look at these fabulous ruins. Turner Field, the Coca-Cola bottling plant,
      the, uh, the airport.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'But tell us: How could a city with such a ... fabulous airport, end
      up underwater?'
  - character: COLONEL
    dialogue: Ah, now that's a story that can only rightly be told in a Chamber of
      Commerce video narrated by folk-rock trubadour Donovan.
  - character: DONOVAN
    dialogue: Atlanta was a city, landlocked, hundreds of miles from the area we now
      call the Atlantic Ocean,
  - character: MERMAIDS
    dialogue: Hail Atlanta!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: The magician?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions of years to evolve into
      mermaids?
  - character: UMBRIEL
    dialogue: Normally, yes, but the caffine really sped things up.  That stuff's
      wonderful.
  - character: COLONEL
    dialogue: So when Umbriel first brought home this carpet bagger, I was again'
      it. But, damnit, if old legs here ain't grown on me!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aw, shucks, Colonel.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Well, it's all very nice here but we should be going. I miss me wife
      and me oxygen.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes, we all miss our loved ones and gases. Come on, Fry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait. I'm not going with you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But, Fry, what about us? What about your life on the surface? You don't
      belong down here.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: She's right, I mean sure they got the Braves but it's a third-rate symphony.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac, be reasonable. Don't you realise
      that if you stay at this depth your body will permanently adapt to the pressure?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Realise it? I don't even understand it!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It means you'll never be able to return to the surface.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't care. I'm staying. I've got everything I want right here.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (shouting) I'm bored! Let's go!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: You know, Fry, I've got a little place just outside town. You could
      come visit, maybe?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join the country club.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) Oh, Fry!  I'll miss you!
  - character: COLONEL
    dialogue: Y'all come back now, y'hear?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (shouting) Let's go, damnit! Let's go!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Well, I guess this is goodbye for me as well.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Whatever.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Later.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Bye.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: No! My home! It burned down!  (crying) How did this happen?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: That's a very good question.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So that's where I left my cigar.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: That just raises further questions!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours have been the happiest days of
      my life.
  - character: UMBRIEL
    dialogue: Oh, Fry! I want you to make a mer-woman outta mer-me.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the vapours!
  - character: UMBRIEL
    dialogue: What the hell is that?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah I'm a little confused too. How do I ... y'know ... with the tail
      and all?
  - character: UMBRIEL
    dialogue: I'm not your first am I? I mean, I-I lay my eggs and leave and you release
      your fertiliser.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (gasping) Why couldn't she be the other type of mermaid, with the fish
      part on top and the lady part on the bottom?
  - character: UMBRIEL
    dialogue: Now who's gonna escort me to the Debutante Ball?
  - character: COLONEL
    dialogue: Well what about that rich young dugong from Macon?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: There! The engine modifications are complete.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Prepare for launch.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me here!
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: And so, in honour of his record-breaking catch, I'm proud to award Bender
      this cheque for $1000.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's you!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, buddy!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: My manwich!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, are you alright? What happened?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: What about Umbriel?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, it turns out I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: (whispering) Trouble in bed.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: Wait a-- This is no record! Gimmie back that cheque! I'm giving it to
      some giant orphans.

      the greatest nanosecond of my life. No, this one is - no, this one. Wait...that
      one was slightly worse. Ah, so far so good on this one.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah!  Alright! Yeah baby!
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: Elzar!  Alright!

      down-home Neptune-style gumbo. Now, step one. You'll wanna boil some oysters
      in a pot of down-home Neptune-style gumbo.
  - character: BENDER

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (whispering) Bender, please try to be a little quieter.

    dialogue: No, you shut up.
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Of course, every now and then you'll wanna knock it up a notch with
      a blast from your spice weasel.  Bam!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh yeah, bam it again Elzar. Knock it up another notch!
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Jeez, who let this guy through the metal detector?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Come on you wimp. Work that weasel. Quit holding out on us.
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: If you promise to stop interrupting alright. Against my will, I'm gonna
      knock it up another notch.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I gotta get this notch-up knocking on film.  Hey Elzar, think fast.

    dialogue: Bam!
  - character: HATTIE
    dialogue: Tell me doctor, how's my cyst?

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Um...a grey-ish blob?
  - character: DOCTOR
    dialogue: Right.  And this one?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Um...a grey-ish blob?

      irritation.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Nice try little boy. You might have your textbook knowledge and your
      real diploma but I have more skill in my little claw than you have in your whole
      carapace.
  - character: DOCTOR
    dialogue: You seem a bit tense.  Here try these.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Sure, butter me up with candy. But it won't work sonny!  (dazed) Why
      always the fighting?
  - character: DOCTOR
    dialogue: Your eye just needs some rest. You'll have to wear this patch for about
      a week.

    dialogue: A week? What do you think Dr Zoidberg?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (dazed) Clack.

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm not deaf. I just have to wear this stupid eye patch. Does it look
      stupid?

      square, I want you to have these complimentary after-dinner chocolates.

    dialogue: What's this under the chocolates?
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Yeah, you take care of that whenever you want.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Hey.

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: $1200?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Holy Zombie Jesus!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: We don't have that kind of money. Especially not Zoidberg.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: They took away my credit card.
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: OK OK wait. I know how to take care of this, no problem.
  - character: URL
    dialogue: You deadbeats are under arrest. It's a stone cold shame.
  - character: SMITTY
    dialogue: He's making a break for it. Get him!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, I was just picking my nose.
  - character: SMITTY
    dialogue: He's picking his nose. Get him!
  - character: SMITTY
    dialogue: The old dine-and-dash huh? My daddy owned a restaurant and it's punks
      like you who kept it from going regional. That's why I became a cop.
  - character: URL
    dialogue: Now it's payback time. Aww yeah.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Please don't hit me. I'm brittle.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey wait a second. I've got the perfect solution.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Listen to the smart robot.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I love cooking and Elzar's ass likes getting kissed right?
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: No question.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So, how 'bout I work part time at the restaurant to pay off our debt?
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: I don't know. I usually hire people who are a little less unbearable.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Oh, Bender's a model employee.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: He's so polite.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: And hard working.

  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Ah. Time for my precious 10am meeting. Where in Legoland is Leela?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm here and I'm getting along just fine thank you. My walk to work
      today just took a little longer than usual. Nibbler took me through the zoo
      for some reason.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Leela, a little help is nothing to be embarrassed about. Like, maybe
      I could do your makeup.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't need help. For you information I did this all by myself.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You look beautiful. Incidentally, my favourite artist is Picasso.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, I'm off to work at the restaurant. One of you will have to fill
      in for me while I'm gone.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Better yet, I'll build someone to fill in for you.  Some kind of gamma
      powered mechanical monster, with freeway on-ramps for arms and a heart as black
      as coal...

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (muttering) Bam yourself!  (talking) Hey, who are they?
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Let's just say they're very good customers and I'm not answering anymore
      questions.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Are they the robot mafia?
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Yes.
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: You call this a table? You call this a table? I wouldn't hit a guy over
      the head with this table.
  - character: CLAMPS
    dialogue: You hear that? The Donbot don't like it. I oughta clamp you - you wanna
      be clamped?
  - character: JOEY
    dialogue: Whoa whoa, calm down Clamps.  The boss, he likes a wall up which his
      back can be put against. Such as like this there.
  - character: WAITRESS

    dialogue: Yeah you did.
  - character: CLAMPS
    dialogue: Hey, you tryin' to steal from the Donbot?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm tryin' but he's not makin' it easy.
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: Get a load of the ball bearings on this guy, huh. I like you kid. Here's
      something for your trouble.  (whispering) It's money.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wow thanks.
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: Hey, you earned that 50 bucks.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You gave me a twenty.
  - character: DONBOT

      Hey Elzar, I quit.

    dialogue: Well, nothing fancy. Just ones and zeros mostly.

      Mechanical Bull" Gravano. And watch out for the cops.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's just what my mom used to tell me.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's some fine oil-ade son. We could use a man like you in the Robot
      Mafia which I'm sorta in.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aw crap, the cops.

    dialogue: Better than me?
  - character: URL

      a nickname right? Let's call him Clamps.
  - character: CLAMPS
    dialogue: Clamps? That's my name you numbskull! Don't make me clamp you one!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: How 'bout "Blotto"? It's witty, it's got street cred. Plus I can keep
      my monogrammed slippers.
  - character: JOEY
    dialogue: Good thinking! Hey hey! Now, this score ain't gonna be no cake walk
      in the tea park alright, there may be some death killing.

  - character: JOEY
    dialogue: Hey hey! Way to go way to be way to shoot!
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: Now since we're committing crimes that may be against the law, I suggest
      you have an alibi.

    dialogue: An alibi huh?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But we're about to take off. We gotta eat our blastoff sundaes.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender's sick.  Need any help taking off?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm fine thank you. A real pilot can navigate by feel alone.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: That's coming outta your pay!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You know the secret of traditional robot cooking? Start with a good
      high-quality oil...then eat it. So whats this big score anyway?
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: We're heisting a shipment of Zuban cigars.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Zubans? Those are the finest cigars in the universe. I can stink up
      a hole maternity ward with one of those things.
  - character: JOEY
    dialogue: Yo there's our pigeon now. Let's shoot bullets out of our guns.
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: 'Alright, here''s the battleplan: We shoot, they surrender, we go aboard,
      somebody does some clamping then we heist the cigars and go home.'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And all without killing anyone.  This gang's got some fresh new ideas.
      I admire that.
  - character: JOEY
    dialogue: Oh, we'll kill 'em alright.
  - character: CLAMPS
    dialogue: We got 'em heavily out-clamped. They won't know what clamped 'em!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow, it's too bad you can't see Leela 'cause theres a cool ship out
      there shooting at somebody.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm taking evasive action.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, Leela?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Stop bothering me Fry, I need full concentration.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Eyesight is for chumps.
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: Their desire to keep living shows me no respect. Hey Blotto, roll down
      the window and start shooting.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Um, uh, um.  (fake hurt) Ooh ow! He got me! Ow, what a shot that guy
      is.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait. Why do the raised letters that normally say "Turnmaster Steering
      company" say "Nibbler"? Oh no!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Great, great. The one time I forgot to buy flight insurance.
  - character: JOEY
    dialogue: They're coming straight towards our proximity. Maybe you should give
      'em the clamps Clamps.
  - character: CLAMPS
    dialogue: Gee you think? You think that maybe I should use these clamps that I
      use every day at every opportunity? (shouting) You're a freaking genius you
      idiot!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: The engine's stalled. I'm trying the manual fuel pump.
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: Hello, we're the Robot Mafia. The entire Robot Mafia. We're here to
      steal your cigars.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You'll never get away with this.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Unless you let us live. Then you'll get off scot free.
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: Joey, Clamps, hurry and blindfold them before they see us some more.
  - character: JOEY
    dialogue: Hey boss, looks like somebody beat us to it.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'll assume that's a joke at my expense. Well, who's laughing now? Heyya!
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: Hey where's Blotto? He should be here learning the trade.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Sorry I'm tardy old bean, I was just enjoying a rather tasty watercress
      sandwich.
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: Hey. He's more classy than I realised. Tie up the prisoners.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Capital idea old sport.  I say, get the hell off me!

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) Oh no, poor Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (fake voice) ...Take that you twit. (normal voice) No! Stop it!
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: That's the last of 'em.  Alright now let's Mafia things up a little.  Joey,
      burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, hey Donny, baby, gimmie a chance here huh? Yous guys skidaddle.
      Let me take care of the doity woik.
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: Hey, I like your attitude. And your latest accent. Keep it up and I

  - character: CLAMPS
    dialogue: (muttering) He's gonna get clamps? Clamps clamps......clamps clamps!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Phew.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela, we may not have much time left......so let's spend all of it
      reminscing about Bender. He was like a big computer than ran on magic.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, help! Help!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You're OK!

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (cheering) Alright!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah it broke alright
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm telling you, Leela was cool, she was in command, and when she kicked
      people it hurt. It really hurt.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, this is the big moment. It's finally time to take my patch off.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I'll handle the snipping. Afterall I do have the proper equipment.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I think it's Blotto. That gangster I saw when my patch fell off.  Professor?
      Where were you at 10pm last night?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Where am I now?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So they sent a helpless child to kill me? Well I'm not going out without
      a fight.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh sweet legal tender!  Kid, tell the Donbot I'm quitting organised
      crime. From now on I'll stick to regular kind.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's funny Bender. With you sick and Leela blind only I know what really
      went on out there. Maybe someday I'll tell you the whole story.

      borrowed from me!
  - character: LEELA

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: "(tempting) Not even if they're saut\xE9ed in a little mud?"
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Here's something. It looks like a ditch full of fried shrimp.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What are you, blind? It looks more like a hole full of fried prawns.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hm. This thing I wear on my wrist says they're not poisonous.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well? How are they?  Oh, they're great! They're like sex! Except I'm
      having them!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You know what these would go great with? Rocks.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look! Here's more!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: The planet's covered with 'em.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Let's bring back a couple of pocketfuls.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No, a whole Bender-ful!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No. Only what we need. Stuff the ship.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Planet Express ship, you are cleared to land.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Roger!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Oh, man, I'm inhaling these things! You guys scored some primo stuff
      here.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: They're tastier than an unguarded penguin nest. What do you call them?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We haven't thought of a name yet.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: They're tasty, right? Let's call 'em "Tasty-cles".
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Ew!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: No!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We can't call them that.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Why not?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It sounds too much like those frozen rocky mountain oysters on a stick.
      You know, Test-cicles?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: According to government records, the only names not yet trademarked
      are "Popplers" and "Zittzers".
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I know, we'll call them Popplers!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Good idea.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Oh, yeah, why not?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You sure picked it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Swish!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Call them what you want. I call them a free meal.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa, whoa, slow down there, Sigmund. I can't stand idly by while poor
      people get free food. We gotta sell these things!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, yeah.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Good idea.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Bender's a genius.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, business is great.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah, great is OK, but amazing would be great.
  - character: VENDOR
    dialogue: Please, don't push, there's hot dogs for everyone.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, Mac, where do you want those rat droppings you ordered?
  - character: WOMAN
    dialogue: That's disgusting.
  - character: VENDOR
    dialogue: Wait a minute. You're not the guy who delivers the rat droppings.
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: What are you selling? Popplers? Never heard of 'em.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Eat it or beat it.
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: Mmm, these are great. Boys, this is your lucky day. I'm Joe Gillman.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow! You're some guy who eats at Fishy Joe's?
  - character: GILLMAN
    dialogue: Hell, no. I am Fishy Joe! I've got a fast-food franchise on every planet
      in the known universe. Uh, except McPluto.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, Fishy. I've been meaning to write you about your in-store kiddie
      parks. The slides won't support an adult robot.
  - character: GILLMAN
    dialogue: Good point, not interested. But these Popplers, these are great. How
      much you sell 'em for?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: A dollar a dozen.
  - character: GILLMAN
    dialogue: You'll never make money that way. You supply 'em to me and I'll sell
      'em for two bucks a dozen at my restaurants. I'll even pay you a dollar a dozen.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes! I'm gonna be rich.  You too but it's hard to get excited about
      that.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: How do we sign?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I can't pay.
  - character: WOMAN
    dialogue: Move it, man. Come on!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela! That's the second billboard you've crashed into this week!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Sorry. I was distracted by those protesters outside our building.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (shouting) Hey! Unless this is a nude love-in, get the hell off my property!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I can, but that's because I'm not a penniless hippie.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) What do you people want?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Or what?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You're vegetarians, who cares what you do?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Animals eat other animals. It's nature.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) OK, we won't eat you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'll go get some more bricks.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, I wish you'd throw out these week-old Popplers. They're getting
      big and scaly. Ooh, there's one left.
  - character: POPPLER
    dialogue: Mama!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Stop! Stop eating Popplers!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Why?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: My booze!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Popplers are intelligent. This one called me mama.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Congratulations. I assume Amy is the father.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Popplers can't talk. Leela must be hallucinating from not eating enough
      Popplers. Here, eat some now.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I said "eat"! Come on, mange!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Sorry, babies.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Leela, maybe you should lie down.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Yes, listen to the father.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm telling you, it spoke to me. Come on, little Poppler, say "mama".
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look, Leela, even if you heard one talk, that doesn't mean it's intelligent.
      I mean, parrots talk and we eat them, right?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah. Maybe it just learned to talk as a parlour trick. Like Fry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Like Fry! Like Fry!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: There's one way, and only one way, to determine if an animal is intelligent.
      Dissect its brain!
  - character: POPPLER
    dialogue: No, mama. Stop grandpa!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Enough chit-chat. Restrain the specimen!
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: Mmm, good.
  - character: WOMAN
    dialogue: Give me some of that special sauce.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) Stop eating Popplers! They can talk!
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: (shouting) Don't stop to talk! Eat Popplers!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey, cut it out!
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: (shouting) Take a coupon, cut it out! Ow! Ow!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: People, I won't let you enter. Popplers are as intelligent as you or
      me.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hear me, hear me! Stop eating Popplers! Stop eating them with honey
      mustard sauce......stop eating them with tangy sweet and sour sauce. Stop eating
      the new fiesta Poppler salad. Stop taking advantage of the money-saving 12-pack.
      Stop enjoying Popplers on the patio, in the car, or on the boat. Wherever good
      times are had!  Ow!
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: 'Tonight on Datenight: Popplers. Eating them. Is it alright to? We have
      with us the CEO of Fishy Joe''s, Mr. "Fishy" Joseph Gillman......Noted anti-eating
      activist, Free Waterfall Jr......And the discoverer of Popplers, Captain Turanga
      Leela.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Turanga?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: That's her name, Philip.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Philip?
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: Fishy Joe, is it wrong to eat intelligent animals?
  - character: GILLMAN
    dialogue: Absolutely not, Linda. I don't think anyone's here to make that claim.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I am.
  - character: GILLMAN
    dialogue: Listen...
  - character: GILLMAN
    dialogue: '...we''re talking about a snack...'
  - character: GILLMAN
    dialogue: '...that''s low in fat...'
  - character: GILLMAN
    dialogue: '...and high in profit.'
  - character: GILLMAN
    dialogue: There's not even any strong evidence that these Popplers are intelligent.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's not true. I have one right here that can talk.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Come on, say "mama".
  - character: POPPLER
    dialogue: Ca-ca!
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: OK, we'll have to bleep that.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look, I'm saying eating meat is wrong...
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't think anyone's here to make that claim.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But eating an intelligent animal is different.
  - character: GILLMAN
    dialogue: Oh, don't force your tired philosophy on us. I mean, the only reason
      we don't eat people is because it tastes lousy.
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: You shut up, please.
  - character: GILLMAN
    dialogue: Popplers are no smarter than any other animal I've served. And that
      includes cats.
  - character: POPPLER
    dialogue: Ca-ca head. Mean, old ca-ca head.
  - character: GILLMAN
    dialogue: Sir, I'm making a point. If these gutter-mouthed creatures are so smart,
      why don't they defend themselves, eh?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Stop it!
  - character: GILLMAN
    dialogue: 'Look, I''m willing to grant that it''s murder. The real issue is: Who''s
      gonna stop me?'
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: We seem to be experiencing technical difficulties.  And, crap like I've
      never seen!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.  Turn down
      that TV, Nd-Nd.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Dear Lord, they're back!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: We're doomed!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Dooomed!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Doooo...!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Now then, the creatures you call "Popplers" come from a nursery planet
      in our sector
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Eck!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: We will begin with the firemen, then the math teachers, and so on in
      that fashion until everyone is eaten.  Transmission over!  Well, that went OK.
      I tell you, when you know you can't scratch, that's when you really have to,
      huh?  Oh, yeah, oh, that feels a lot better. What? It's still on?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: As chief negotiator, I speak for all of Earth when I mourn the regrettable
      loss of the Omicronian young. We share your pain.  Mmm.  If we could undo the
      damage... These would be great with quack-a-mole.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: (shouting) Stop eating our young! And it's pronounced guacamole!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Alright, I'm putting them away.  Now, uh, what is it you want?
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: We demand -  We demand to eat one human for each Omicronian that was
      eaten.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Fair enough. How many is that?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: 198 billion, sir.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Very well. You will provide us with 198 billion humans. And, uh, small
      fries.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Oh, alright, cottage cheese!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Sir? (whispering) There aren't that many human beings.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: 'A though occurs: There aren''t that many humans.'
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: We're willing to wait a few weeks while you shore up the numbers.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Hmm. 198 billion babies in a few weeks. We'll need an army of super-virile
      men scoring 'round the clock! I'll do my part. Kif, clear my schedule.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I wish they'd just wipe out humanity and get it over with. It's the
      waiting I can't stand.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's stupid.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: My fellow Earthlings, we have reached an agreement. Using the twin guns
      of grace and tact, I blasted our worthless enemies with a fair compromise.  They
      will not eat everyone on Earth.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: I filled up on nuts at the negotiation.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Instead, they will eat only a single human of their choice.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: We choose to eat the first Earthling who ate our offspring.  Here is
      the culprit, as photographed by our nanny-cam satellite.  She must be sacrificed,
      but the rest of you shall be spared.
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: Tonight, the world watches in horror as an earthling is eaten alive
      on network television. This grim scene of unimaginable carnage is brought to
      you - by Fishy Joe's! Try our new Extreme Walrus Juice! 100% fresh-squeezed
      walrus. Ride the walrus!
  - character: ANNOUNCER
    dialogue: Ladies and gentlemen. The Omicronians!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Greetings, Earth morsels.
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: (shouting) You suck!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Get a job!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'll miss you, Leela.  I know you're just a carbon-based life form but
      I'll always think of you as a big pile of titanium.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What Bender means is, you're really brave, and smart, and beautiful,
      and a great friend.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) Just like titanium!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This is all a big load. I was the one trying to save the Popplers.  You
      were sucking them down like the fat hog you are and you were stepping on them
      for fun.  You both should be in here instead of me.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (whispering to Fry) Someone's acting awfully aluminum.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Leela, my sweet, I've come to save you. I have a devious plan!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, great, Captain Moron has a plan. Why don't you tell it to Wingus
      and Dingus here?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Wingus? Dingus? Listen up. We're gonna give the aliens the old switcheroo!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You mean -
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Correct. I found a giant hideous ape that looks exactly like Leela.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It doesn't look anything like me. The hair is all wrong.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Don't worry. Kif is an expert stylist, as you can plainly see.  Mmm!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You know, this might actually work. The Omicronians seem to have trouble
      telling one person from another.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: True. At the negotiations, they thought Kif here was the statesman and
      I was a jabbering mental patient. Isn't that right, Kif?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Please, I'm creating.  Voila!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Bingo!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's Leela!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I'm seeing double!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: I grow hungry! Bring on the one called "Leela".
  - character: WAITER
    dialogue: That comes with salad or soup.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Uh, salad.
  - character: WAITER
    dialogue: Ranch or vinaigrette?
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Vinaigrette!
  - character: WAITER
    dialogue: Balsamic or raspberry?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: '(whispering) People of Earth: Shh!'
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Hmm. Yes, this is one. Definitely. I recognise her slumping posture
      and hairy knuckles.
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: This is it. If the aliens fall for Zapp's ploy, the Earth will be saved.
      Brought to you by Fishy Joe's. Ride the walrus.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: W-What's happening? I'm losing the crowd.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Why'd you open your bong hole you smelly hippie? You'd sacrifice a beautiful
      woman to save a moderately-attractive monkey? You must've smoked some bad granola.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: The one called "Smelly Hippie" is right. This is a monkey!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Where is the real female?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I'll never tell.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Where is the real female?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I'll get her for you.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I realise this may hurt our chances of consummating our relationship
      again.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Go consummate yourself.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Stop talking, you're getting cold.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Please! I just paid off my car!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I can't look!
  - character: POPPLER
    dialogue: Stop!  People of Earth. I am Jrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8. Could
      someone lower this thing for me?  Now then, if Leela gets eaten, I get eaten.
  - character: JRRR
    dialogue: But elder one -
  - character: JRRR
    dialogue: Hear me out. There are many good reasons to eat. Hunger, boredom, wanting
      to be the world's fattest man. But not revenge. Are we no better than they?
      Besides, Leela's my friend.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: (mumbling) Is this true, Earthling?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (mumbling) Yeah, it is.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Leela's garbled words have opened my eyes.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Is he your friend too?
  - character: JRRR
    dialogue: No.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: I think there was something funny in that hippie.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thank you, Jrrr.  I hope you'll always think of me as your mom.
  - character: JRRR
    dialogue: When my species grows up, we eat our moms!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Whoop!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: People of Earth - oh, that hippie's starting to kick in - we've all
      learned a valuable lesson today, I realise now that - dude! My hand are huge!  The
      can touch anything but themselves. Oh, wait.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Whoa!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Whoa, I feel like I'm flying!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: A toast to Leela. She showed us it's wrong to eat certain things.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hear, hear!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Let's get drunk!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Aww, thanks, guys. Pass the veal, please.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Here you go.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Mmm, let me get some of that suckling pig.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Who wants dolphin?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Dolphin? But dolphins are intelligent.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Not this one. He blew all his money on instant lottery tickets.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: OK.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, OK.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: That's different.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good, good.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Pass the blowhole.

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Very nice. Where'd you steal them?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I didn't steal 'em, I bought 'em.  I love her that much.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: What did you get her, you mushy gizmo?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, precious things. I found the most adorable little figurine of mice
      having tea.  And a framed picture of me when I was only a month old.  But, the
      best part is, I found my exact feelings expressed in a greeting card.
  - character: LEELA

  - character: IGNER
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: You've noticed I design all my robots with antennas. Everyone thinks
      it's just to make them more science-fiction-y. But the antennas are really for
      my universal robot controller!
  - character: LARRY
    dialogue: So they do whatever you want? No wonder you love Mother's Day.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: (shouting) I hate Mother's Day you dribbling pukes! (talking) It brings
      back awful memories. But so help me, this year everyone will hate it as much
      as I do.

    dialogue: Someday, I want to marry a girl like her.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Hello, everyone. It's time for my annual private get-together with my
      robot children.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm her favourite.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, see you back at the office. And don't forget to tell your mom
      you love her.

    dialogue: Any jerk can tell her! Bender has a little more up his sleeve.

    dialogue: Hello, dearies.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Mom! It's me, Bender. Look at me! I want attention. Hey ho!

  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: Morbo demands comments.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Well, I've never seen my babies act this way. I blame today's violent
      media.

    dialogue: Violent media? What a load of -

    dialogue: Bender, thank God you're here. Talk some sense into the other machines.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No way, pork pouch. I'm rebelling with my brother devices. Isn't that
      right, Comrade Greeting Card?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: From now on, you guys'll do all the work while I sit on the couch and
      do nothing.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes! In your face Gandhi!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, we can live without machines. I was in Webelos.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Are you mad? Without machines, who will feed us and clothe us and compose
      our smooth jazz?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It'll be the end of civilised society.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'In my time, we didn''t depend on high-tech gadgets like you do. We
      didn''t need a mechanical washing unit to wash our clothes. We just used a washing
      machine. And look: You don''t need an electric can-opener to feed yourself.
      All you need is a trusty Swiss Army knife. Ow!  (crying) I''m hungry!'

  - character: IGNER
    dialogue: Mommy, why are you making civilisation collapse?
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Oh, I don't know. I guess Mother's Day just puts me in a bad mood.
  - character: LARRY
    dialogue: Why's that, Ma?
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: One Mother's Day, 70 years ago, the only man I ever loved walked out
      on me. Some snot-eating bastards say it made me a bitter woman.
  - character: LARRY
    dialogue: Gee, Ma. You're not a bitter -
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: (shouting) Cram it, ape!  (talking) I haven't seen that magnificent

    dialogue: Hooray! I'm useful! I'm having a wonderful time!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: What happens if the fire goes out?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: We'll go across the street to Pottery Barn and steal their fire.

    dialogue: 'We could use my new invention: A pointy rock tied to a stick.'
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Outsiders!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Defend the fire!
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: We've come for you!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Wha?  W-What do you want from me?
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: We want you to get back together with Mom. Please. It's the only way
      to make her happy again.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: W-W-Wait. You mean, you, and Mom?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Played pelvic pinochle? I'm afraid so.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Eck.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It's a humiliating story that I hope never to tell. Well, pull up a
      chair.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (voice-over) Our paths first crossed when I was a researcher at Mom's
      Friendly Robot Company.  The moment our eyes met, we knew we'd be going at it
      like woodchucks.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (voice-over) She was my first love - or at least the earliest one I
      can still remember. But then, 70 years ago today...
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good news, Mom. I've invented a new children's toy.  I call it "Q.T.
      McWhiskers"! When you pet it, it shoots rainbows from its eyes.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Wonderful, Hubie. We'll build them 8 feet tall and replace the rainbow
      with a neutron laser. We'll make billions on the intergalactic arms market!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: But things 8 feet tall aren't cute! That's why my Colossal Tammy Tinkle
      Doll was such a failure. Oh, you don't understand me. We're finished!
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: She never got over it, Professor. Hell hath no fury like the vast robot
      armies of a woman scorned.
  - character: LARRY
    dialogue: She commands them with a remote control she keeps in her...(whispering)
      bra.
  - character: IGNER
    dialogue: But if the glasses man makes up with Mommy, she'll be happy and stop
      the scary robots.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Make up with her? After she went all psycho when I thought everything
      was cool? Impossible!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, the TV's getting away!
  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: And that's why the third graders at PS139 are Morbo's Vermin Of The
      Week.
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: In actual news, the human race was doomed to extinction today as the
      robot revolt turned violent.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait. Didn't you say Mom keeps the robot control in her bra?
  - character: LARRY
    dialogue: (whispering) Bra.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Professor, you don't have to get back together with Mom. You just have
      to seduce her, get her bra off, and use the remote to deactivate the robots.
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: That's so filthy, it just might work.
  - character: IGNER
    dialogue: The man is going to touch Mommy?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: The thought of caressing that leathery hide makes the tapioca rise in
      my gullet.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Professor, please. The fate of the world depends on you getting to second
      base with Mom.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Very well. If cop a feel I must, then cop a feel I shall!
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: For this demonstration, I have placed one of Mother's bras on Igner.  The
      robot controller is nestled here in the left cup.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Never fear. My magic fingers still know how to do their stuff!
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: To escape the robot death squads, we'll take Mother to her rustic cabin
      in the Bronx.
  - character: LARRY
    dialogue: You can get there using this precious, non-computerised map.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Leela bring fire?
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: No. We're set for fire, thanks.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: The professor can't walk all the way to the Bronx. How are we gonna
      get there without a hover-car?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait. In my time, we had a way of moving things long distances without
      hovering.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Impossible!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It was called...let me think. It was really famous - Ruth Gordon had
      one. The wheel!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Never heard of it.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Show us this, "the wheel".
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: There. Finished!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Sweet!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Wow!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wouldn't it work better if the wheels were round?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (snappy) It's my invention, we do it my way! Now all we need is something
      to pull it and we're set!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Heyya!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: Hurry! The robots have taken Suffolk County!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I'm ready to seduce. I'm wearing my kissing dentures and my evening
      truss.
  - character: LARRY
    dialogue: Here. Give her these.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And if that doesn't work, I got you a six-pack of champagne and a funnel.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Who the sweaty hell is it?  Hubert Farnsworth?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I was out fleeing some robots and the silvery moonlight glinting off
      their bloody claws made me think of you.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: It's been a long time. You pus-dripping sack of double-smoked butt jerky!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Uh-huh. May I come in?
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Never!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Is this what human mating looks like? Because I like it!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: (shouting) Move your freaking hoof, you goat!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Here, I brought you these.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Oh, daffodils. 70 years and you remembered my favourite flower.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You favourite what? Why does my foot hurt?
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: (sexfully) Won't you come in?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yes!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: You broke my heart, Hubert.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: And you broke mine. Granted, that was four or five hearts ago.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: So what have you been up to all these years?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, inventing, sending delivery crews to their doom, breeding atomic
      monsters.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Honestly, Hubert. You and your atomic monsters.  Your eyes always were
      the most beautiful shade of milky-white.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: And your skin still dangles so gracefully from your neck.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Darling Hubie, I should never have tried to tangle with that cute little
      Q. T. McWhiskers.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No, it was silly of me to object. One foot tall, eight feet, 15 feet;
      what does it matter?
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: You should see the new 16-foot models.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: 16 feet? Go to hell! I was a fool to think you'd changed, you old bat!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: (shouting) Filthy, toothless nerd bastard!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (shouting) Damned she-fossil!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: (shouting) Stink pig!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (thinking) Here we go. Just unhook it and get the remote. So many hooks!
      Come on, Farnsworth. Drat, the first one's back on again! I give up! Wait! Victory!  Oh,
      my. Now I'll just...the remote...I'll just... (talking) Oh, my.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm worried. It shouldn't take this long to get to second base.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Land robots!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Where in funkytown is the professor?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Nothing in here but a couple of elephant skin rugs.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, yes.
  - character: ROBOT
    dialogue: (from outside) They're inside! Get 'em!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: I suppose I should switch of the robots before they ruin this wonderful
      romantic evening. Everyone, help Mom find her bra.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: There it is!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Is anything not a robot?
  - character: LAMP
    dialogue: I'm not a robot.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Alright, greeting card, I'll grab the cash, you wreck up the place.
      And - huh?
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: You, bending unit. Mommy needs that bra to end the robot rebellion.
      Stretch up and get it for me.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Sorry, Ma, but you ordered me to rebel. And loot I shall! Ooh! A six-pack
      of strawberry champagne. Don't mind if I help myself!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Say what?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No liquor? Do svidaniya, comrade!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hurry, Bender. Get the bra!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: OK, fan. Just hold still and let me just - whoa!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I love you, Mom. Let's grow ancient together.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Way to go, Professor. The plan worked.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Plan? What plan? I thought this was a spontaneous whirlwind of hot,
      dry sex.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: 'Look: It started out as a calculated plot to rummage through your underwear.
      But once I got in there, I found more - much more. And now I want to shout our
      love from the rooftops. Perhaps I''ll breed some sort of albino shouting gorilla.'
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: (shouting) Get out of my house, you lying scum pile. I never want to
      see you again.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: But, dustcakes...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, time for this robot to get back to work.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Too bad it didn't work out with Mom, professor.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes. But I'll always love her in my own subtle way.
  - character: GORILLAS
    dialogue: (shouting) Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom!

    dialogue: Ah!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Pretty long, eh?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, it's really long. But what did you just turn on with it?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, that's just the What-If machine I invented. You pose it a What-If
      question and it generates a video simulation of what would happen.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Does it really work?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Of course it works!  It's just not very long.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'Ooh! Ooh!  I wanna aks it a question! As a robot living among humans,
      I''ve never really felt accepted at parties or nude beaches. So I''ve always

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Put it there, pal!  I meant your wallet.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, yeah! That calms the shakes.  Hey! (laughing) Aw, quit it1 Come
      on!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) Stop! The robot's not your enemy! He's just a poor, misunderstood--

    dialogue: Uh--
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Well, there goes the neighbourhood. There goes another neighbourhood.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: We're jerked! Nothing can stop a monster that big.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Nothing except and even equally big monster. This is chance to try out
      my experimental enlarging ray. But we'll need a guinea pig.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: What's this? Two meals in one week?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Gotcha!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Oh, yes!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Friends! Help! A guinea pig tricked me!  What?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: So, now Zoidberg is big, huh? That's more like it! Who's intimidating
      who now, big city?  Hello, Mr. Chase Manhattan Bank. Deny my credit card application,
      will you?  Ah, the famed Apollo Theatre. Boo me off stage on open-mike night,
      huh? I'll show you!
  - character: BENDER

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Goodnight, sweet prince.
  - character: NARRATOR
    dialogue: (voice-over) Interesting stuff. Stay tuned for more Tales Of Interest!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well, Leela, care to give the What-If machine a whirl?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Maybe later. I-I mean, I don't know what to ask about.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Come on, woman! Just pick something.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, be more impulsive. Like this.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Go, man! Go!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I can be really impulsive. It just takes me a while.  Alright, Professor!
      Let's do it. Make that machine show me what would happen if I was a little more
      impulsive. Just a little.  Not too much.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'Hey, you guys. Look what I bought on a wild impulse: New boots. They''re
      like my old ones but with a crazy green stripe. Woo! Never know what I''m gonna
      do next!'
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Leela, could you come in here for a moment. I have something important
      to tell you.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I can't live forever and I need an heir. Someone to spend my vast riches
      and take care of my man-eating anteaters when I'm gone.  The others simply aren't
      level-headed enough. They're too impulsive. Not like you. Not like old, predictable,
      dull-as-dishwater Leela.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hello? New boots!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That's why I've made you my sole heir. The day I die, you'll be a very
      wealthy woman. Oh, my, yes. Incredibly wealthy. The day I die. Because you're
      so unimpulsive.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yah!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, God! What have I done?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, just try to be nonchalant.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Alright, so you're nonchalant. Quit rubbing our noses in it.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Sweet giant anteater of Saint Anita! The Professor's been eaten by giant
      anteaters!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: What?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: If y'ask me, it's mighty suspicious! I'm gonna call the police ... right
      after I flush some things.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Police? Bah! Nosy meddlers! It so happens I have mail order degrees
      in Murderology and Murderonomy.  Zoidberg is afoot!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Perhaps the Professor's files can clear things up. (reading) "Citation
      for public nudity", "Conspiracy to commit public nudity". (talking) Aha! A new
      will! Naming ...  ... you as his sole heir.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That doesn't prove I killed him.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: It's a video will. It shows you killing him.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (from meeting room) Hi-yah!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Alright, anteater number one, who are you protecting?  Is it anteater
      number two?  Don't stick your tongue out at me. I need a name!  What? How do
      you spell that?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: (shouting; from meeting room) What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?
      It is! My precious torso!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whatya got? Disposal trouble?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No! Everything's just--
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Sure is shocking about the Professor, huh?.  And now Hermes is mysteriously
      missing. Anyhow, it doesn't affect me, Bender. Hey, what's this? Hermes' dreadlocks?
      And his arm? Leela, I'm shocked. Food goes in the disposal, hair and flesh go
      in the trash!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm sorry, I couldn't stop-- W-Wait. Don't you care that I murdered
      Hermes?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Not even a little. There's nothing wrong with murder, just so long as
      you let Bender wet his beak.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You're blackmailing me?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: '"Blackmail" is such an ugly word. I prefer "extortion". The "X" makes
      it sound cool.  Please, honey, I''m made of metal. Like you''re really gonna
      hurt me with a-- Hey! What are you doing with that microwave?'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, that's it. No more killing! Next time you feel like killing just
      have a stick of gum.  Now to dispose of the body.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Wow! Sporty go-cart, Leela! So hip and sexy. Not like you at all.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Do you have any gum?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: No.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Ah, the gang's all here.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Who are you?
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: Scruffy, the janitor.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I've never seen you before.
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: I've never seen you before neither.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: 'Quiet, please. I''ve called you all here to the parlour to watch as
      I gradually solve the crime. One of the people in this room ... is a big murderer!  You
      see, the killer left one fatal clue: This boot print on the Professor''s lab
      coat.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, couldn't be me. I never wear boots. See?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ew! What smells like boot feet?
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: This is preposterous. Obviously the murderer is--
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: My next clue came at 4.15, when the clock stopped. And another came
      two hours later at 4.15, when I discovered the murdered body of Amy's dead,
      deceased corpse.
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: Scruffy knows who killed them people. In Scruffy's opinion, it were--
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: So, it's just as I suspected all along. The crime is unsolvable!  A
      letter from Bender, my good friend. (reading) Dear Dr. Jerkberg, if you're reading
      this, I'm already dead. The person who killed me was ... was--  My God! It can't
      be! The murderer, it was--
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm bored. You're boring, Zoidberg. I'm gonna go watch TV.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Could you get the lights on your way out?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Whatcha eating?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Lobster. Want some?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sure.  Y'know, I think I finally figured out what's behind all these
      mysterious deaths.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Really?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Was Planet Express built on an Indian graveyard?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Then ... then ... it was you!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (crying) I don't know what came over me. I killed one person on impulse.
      Then I had to kill another. And another.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, that covers the first three killings.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: And now, to make sure you won't talk, I'm gonna have to do something
      really impulsive!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So, Fry, what do you think of the impulsive new me?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I like it!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Good. Now let me just get the lights.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I really like it!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Fry?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Um, I have a question. What if Bender was really giant?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You idiot! We already saw that.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I know. I liked it. I wanna see it again.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: We're not seeing it again! Ask something less stupid.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, alright. How 'bout this? What if I never fell into that freezer-doodle
      and came to the future-jiggy?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That question is less stupid, though you asked it in a profoundly stupid
      way.  What would happen if Fry never came to the future?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hello? Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener?! Aw, crud!  Here's to another
      lousy Millennium! Ow!  I should have left you floating in the toilet!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What is it?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It appears that the very fabric of space-time has ripped.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, look! An ugly scared guy! Boo!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Who are you monsters? Is one of you Icy Wiener?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: If that's his pizza, then I'm icy whatever!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You believe me about the monsters, right, Mr. Panucci?
  - character: PANUCCI
    dialogue: 'There''s only three real monsters, kid: Dracula, Blacula and Son of
      Kong. Now quit picking your nose and knead that dough!  Hey! The usual, Professor
      Hawking?'
  - character: HAWKING
    dialogue: No. Today I'd like something good.
  - character: PANUCCI
    dialogue: Hawking, you're alright! I'll make you the usual!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey! Stephen Hawking! Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?
  - character: HAWKING
    dialogue: Sure. Why not?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'Let me ask you something: Has anyone ever discovered a hole in nothing
      with monsters in it?  ''Cause if I''m the first, I want them to call it "a Fry
      Hole".'
  - character: HAWKING
    dialogue: There is nothing to be concerned about. I must go. There is much to
      do.
  - character: PANUCCI
    dialogue: Hey, Hawking! Your pizza's ready.
  - character: HAWKING
    dialogue: Toss it in the garbage!
  - character: HAWKING
    dialogue: (from alley) There he is. Seize him.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (from alley) Who said that?  Hey! What the--? Ooh! Ow! Ow!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Who are you people?
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: I'm Al Gore. And these are my Vice Presidential Action Rangers; A group
      of top nerds whose sole duty it is to prevent disruptions in the space-time
      continuum.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I thought your duty was to cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: That, and protect the space-time continuum. Read the constitution!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hmm. So I guess you'll wanna see my Fry Hole.
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: very much so. But first, meet the Action Rangers. You already know Stephen
      Hawking. Also with us are Nichelle Nichols, a.k.a. Commander Uhura.
  - character: NICHOLS
    dialogue: Incoming transmission from MCI one rate department. It sounds like a
      limited-time offer.
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: Tell them I'm in the tub! To my left you'll recognise Gary Gygax, inventor
      of Dungeons & Dragons.
  - character: GYGAX
    dialogue: Greetings! It's a ...  ... pleasure to meet you!
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: And our summer intern, Deep Blue. The world's foremost chess-playing
      computer.
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: Not all missions can be solved with chess, Deep Blue. Someday you'll
      understand that.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Where am I, anyway?
  - character: NICHOLS
    dialogue: You're travelling in a specially-equipped terrestrial transport module.
  - character: GYGAX
    dialogue: A school bus!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So what do you nerds want?
  - character: NICHOLS
    dialogue: It's about that rip in space-time that you saw.
  - character: HAWKING
    dialogue: I call it a "Hawking Hole".
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No fair! I saw it first!
  - character: HAWKING
    dialogue: Who is The Journal Of Quantum Physics going to believe?
  - character: GYGAX
    dialogue: Mr. Fry, the time disruption indicates that some of that was supposed
      to happen but didn't, due to a quantum fluctuation.
  - character: NICHOLS
    dialogue: That's why we had to beat you with tennis rackets.
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: If we don't go back there and make the event happen, the entire universe
      will be destroyed! And as an environmentalist, I'm against that.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So then my chair tilted back and I almost fell into this freezer thingy.
  - character: HAWKING
    dialogue: I call it a "Hawking Chamber".
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But instead of falling in and getting frozen, I missed and wanged my
      head.
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: 'Well it''s obvious what should have happened: That wang to the head
      should have killed you.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, what?
  - character: NICHOLS
    dialogue: Let's finish the job.
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: No! Wait! There must be a peaceful--
  - character: HAWKING
    dialogue: Hold him down.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
  - character: NICHOLS
    dialogue: Something's wrong. Murder isn't working and that's all we're good at.
  - character: GYGAX
    dialogue: Let's try something else. Maybe we should--
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: Put the dice away before I take them away.
  - character: NICHOLS
    dialogue: Wait. I'm getting an idea. What if Fry was supposed to get frozen?
  - character: HAWKING
    dialogue: Yes. Shove him in the tube. It was my idea.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, there he is again. And he brought nerds! Take this!
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: Get in the tube, dummy! We only have a few seconds before the universe
      is destroyed.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Alright. But I need a weapon to fight off drunken robots when I wake
      up.
  - character: GYGAX
    dialogue: Here. Take my plus-one mace.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: OK, here I go.
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: You fool! You foolish fool!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Eh? What's the worst thing that can happen?
  - character: HAWKING
    dialogue: Great. The entire universe was destroyed.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Destroyed? Then where are we now?
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: 'I don''t know. But I can darn well tell you where we''re not: The universe.'
  - character: NICHOLS
    dialogue: Eternity with nerds. It's the Pasadena Star Trek convention all over
      again.
  - character: GYGAX
    dialogue: Anyone wanna play Dungeons & Dragons for the next quadrillion years?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sure.
  - character: HAWKING
    dialogue: I guess.
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: I'm a 10th-level Vice President!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That story was preposterous. Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria! This thing
      isn't worth the gold it's made of.  Anyway, the fing-longer seems to be arousing
      success.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Good work.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Congratulations!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Right on, Professor!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: So that's what things would be like if I'd invented the fing-longer.  A
      man can dream though. A man can dream.

  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh no, someone you know must've died.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I hope it was one of my enemies, those guys suck!  Oh no, my uncle Vladimir.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. When's the funeral?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Tomorrow, at the family castle. Followed by the reading of his will.  Well,
      I'm rich. Goodbye, losers, whom I've always hated!  C'mon, it'll be fun!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, pardon me, my good simpleton, could you take us to yon castle?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Fuf! Superstitious robot mumbo-jumbo.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes, you idiot.  The circuit diagram is right here on the inside of
      your case.
  - character: PREACHERBOT
    dialogue: I now commend Vladimir's remains to the earth. Filings to filings; rust
      to rust.
  - character: SOLICITORBOT
    dialogue: (reading) To my loyal butler, You There, I leave a pittance, to be paid
      in 20 equal installments of one-twentieth of a pittance each.  To my lazy, spoiled
      son, Tandy, who never learned the value of a dollar, I leave my entire $10 million
      fortune.
  - character: TANDY
    dialogue: (whispering) Is that a lot?
  - character: SOLICITORBOT
    dialogue: (reading) And to my loving nephew, Bender, assuming he's not responsible
      for my death, I leave my castle.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes! Let's stay there tonight.
  - character: SOLICITORBOT
    dialogue: (reading) On condition that he spend one night within its walls.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh man, there's always a catch.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'Ah! I got a good vibe from this place: Nice long dinner table, quiet,
      well-behaved spiders, graveyard-adjacent. Yep! It''s gonna be -'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What is it?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That painting, the eyes are watching me!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Hmm.  It has motor eye sensors attached to motion detectors.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So does my butt, but I don't frame it and put it on the wall! Although...
      What's that?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I don't know, but it's infectious!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No doubt about it, this place is haunted.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Don't be silly mon, the last ghost died over 200 years ago.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: The last human ghost. But robot ghosts?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (reading) 0101100101. (talking) What does it mean?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's just gibberish.  (reading) 1010011010?!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uncle Vladimir!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's what they said about being alive.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Just as I suspected. These robots were buried in improperly shielded
      coffins. Their programming leaked into the castles wiring through this old,
      abandoned modem allowing them to project themselves as holograms.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Of course! It was so obvious!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes, that sequence of words I said made perfect sense. We really should
      tell Bender there's nothing to be afraid of.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (screaming) No!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender, wake up!  He's OK! Quick, does anyone have any liquor?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, what happened?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Somebody tried to run me over. And not with a normal hover-car. It crept
      along the ground on round, rubber feet, like a wolf!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Poor Bender, you're seeing things. You've been drinking too much, or
      too little, I forget how it works with you. Anyway, you haven't drunk exactly
      the right amount.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Maybe he's right, look at these tracks.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I think Bender may be telling the truth.]
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Bender, you look awful. I prescribe make-up. Here. It just so happens
      I have my Mary Kay sample case!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah, I just need sleep. I had nightmares all night about cars running
      people over.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Many people dream of a fresh, new look. And Mary Kay can make those
      dreams come true.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look at this. They found those same rubbery tracks right here in New
      New York.  There was a hit-and-run by the robot porno theatre.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Robot porno theatre? I was in that...general area, last night. Whoever
      ran me down on those moors must've followed me back here.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Bender mon, no one's trying to run you over. Stop being a big, hallucinating
      baby.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'Yeah?! Could a big, hallucinating baby do this: (crying) I scared!'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Where...? What the...?  Transmission fluid? Where have I been? What
      happened?
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: Get outta here, yous lazy bum!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Please, I'm scared.
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: We're all scared, it's the human condition. Why do you thinks I put
      on this tough-guy facade? Now beat it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I passed out around midnight, which is much earlier that usual, and
      when I woke up, I found these in my chest cabinet.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aw, relax buddy. You were probably just shooting some big, fuzzy craps.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No, I think I may have hurt someone. Oh Lord, I'm on the verge of a
      nervous meltdown.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Geez Bender, you're scaring me. You're going wacko!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You're right, I need professional help. And damn the expense.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Damn the expense!
  - character: GYPSY
    dialogue: My friend, you have nothing to worry about. Except a nightmare-ish life
      of unremitting horror!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Phew!
  - character: GYPSY
    dialogue: For, you see, you are a were-car.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: A were-car?
  - character: GYPSY
    dialogue: The car that ran you down on the moors was also a were-car. It beamed
      a virus to you through its demonic headlights.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's crazy!
  - character: GYPSY
    dialogue: Yes. So crazy that it must be true! Each midnight, when your clock resets
      to zero, your hardware reconfigures into a murderous, four-wheeled car.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough to get away
      with it. Can't you help me?
  - character: GYPSY
    dialogue: Yes. But you must be willing to pay a terrible price.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  - character: GYPSY
    dialogue: Follow me.
  - character: GYPSY
    dialogue: According to this ancient read-me file, your only hope is to destroy
      the original were-car.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm with you.
  - character: GYPSY
    dialogue: In its death throes, the dread car will beam out the virus's uninstall
      program, thus ridding you of the curse.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Otherwise, I can never die?
  - character: GYPSY
    dialogue: Who said that? Sure you can die. You want to die?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No! I wanna live! There's still too many things I don't own!
  - character: GYPSY
    dialogue: Then live on, forever cursed. Each night, your attacks will become more
      gruesome until, one dark night you are doomed to kill your dearest friend.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I wouldn't wanna be me right now.
  - character: GYPSY
    dialogue: Now go! Go!  Uh, could one of you just...? Ah, forget it. I'll just
      sleep here.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: There. No rampaging for you tonight.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry you down, have a nice breakfast
      and then go hunt down and slaughter that ancient evil.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It'll be a rich, full day.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, goodnight. I'm gonna go make my dinners for the next month and
      freeze them.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) Bender, no!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) Fry, stay back!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) You jerk. I thought I was your best friend. What kind of
      two-timing kill-mobile are you?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I can't believe this. Bender is supposed to murder his closest friend,
      which I thought was me. But he went straight for you. He didn't even try to
      second-degree murder me.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Could you give me some help? I think Bender crushed my foot.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Stop rubbing it in.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh God. Fry, I'm so glad to see you. I didn't hurt you did I?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Not physically. But why don't you ask your new best friend, Leela?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I tried to run you over?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It was very sweet of you, Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fry, it doesn't mean anything. I have love enough for two.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Words. Nothing sweet, sweet words that turn into bitter orange wax in
      my ears.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Enough with the feelings, you two. If we're gonna cure Bender we've
      got to go back to the castle and hunt down the original were-car.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Cursed, got it.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whatever.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: The tracks lead here.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Thanks, eagle eye.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Now it's daylight, so he should be in robot form. But be careful. Many
      robots are stupid and violent.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (sarcastic) I wish I was stupid and violent. Then we'd see what's what,
      I'd pound him till -
  - character: YOKELBOT
    dialogue: Get ye to your house, ye ignorant villagers.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We are not ignorant villagers, we're sophisticated New New Yorkers.
      Whup his butt!
  - character: YOKELBOT
    dialogue: Stop! What are ye doing?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: We're whaling on the original were-car, which is you, you jerk.
  - character: YOKELBOT
    dialogue: Ye think me be he?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: "S\xED."
  - character: YOKELBOT
    dialogue: Nee. I mean, "no". I was given the curse many a year ago while on a
      bird-watching trip to the Arctic...
  - character: YOKELBOT
    dialogue: (voice-over) ...I was attacked by a vicious, motorised sled. The natives
      called it the abominable snowmobile.
  - character: INUITBOT
    dialogue: Yes, it's true. I ran over that bird-watching jerk and a hundred others.
      Even my best friend from aromatherapy school.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I once had a best friend who liked to smell things with me.
  - character: INUITBOT
    dialogue: Alas, I'm afraid I'm not the original were-car. I received the curse
      while taking a learning annex class from a famous robot actor.
  - character: INUITBOT
    dialogue: (voice-over) You know him as Calculon.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: (dramatically) Oh, fate most cruel, would that my boundless acting skills
      would avail me a sword with which to slay this wretched curse.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Let's kick him some more.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: No, wait, let me explain. (dramatically) It all began one fateful night
      a thousand years ago.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're a thousand years old? Your bio says you're
      27!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: 'Lies! I change my identity and upgrade my appearance every few decades
      to avoid suspicion. I was all of history''s great acting robots: Acting Unit
      0.8, Thespo-mat, David Duchovny!'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look, are you the original were-car or not?
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: No, but you are nearing the end of your search, for you see I was attacked
      by the original were-car.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Give us a name MacButt!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: The year was 2019, and I was just a lowly robot arm...
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: (voice-over) ...working in an automotive research lab. I was working
      on Project Satan......a savage, intelligent military vehicle built from the
      most evil parts of the most evil cars in all the world. The steering wheel from
      Hitler's staff car, the left-turn signal from Charles Manson's VW, the windshield
      from that car that played Knight Rider.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Knight Rider wasn't evil.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: His windshield wipers were. It didn't come up much in the show though.
      Anyway...
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: (voice-over) ...Only after bringing Project Satan to life did they discover
      they had made a horrible mistake.  For you see, it was pure evil.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So what happened to Project Satan?
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: (voice-over) It's either in Paris, or much more likely...
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: (voice-over) ...still in the abandoned automotive lab.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You guys distract the were-car and I'll kill it by plugging its exhaust
      pipe with this silver potato.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (whispering) Psst, there it is.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It looks so unhappy. Excuse me? Are you Project Satan?  Don't be afraid.
      We know what you are.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Would you like us to...put you out of your misery?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Look, everyone love killing people, but I don't wanna hurt my friends.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh no! It's midnight.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, this is starting to feel pretty good!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, distract him.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, Project Satan! Over here! I'm a blind pedestrian. 20 points!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh no, there's no exhaust pipe!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh boy, I feel like a car in a candy store!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (gasping) Yes! He chose me! He's trying to kill me! Leela, I'm so happy!  (talking)
      Oh, thanks Bender.  (choking) Too tight! Too tight!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Whoa!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh-oh.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, you're cured! But what happened to Fry?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) I must've killed him. He's my best friend and I killed him.
      I never felt so empty inside.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender, I'm alive!  You didn't hurt me at all. But I know you wanted
      to, and that's what matters.  Here's to you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, that's my last beer, you bastard. I'll kill you!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'll kill you too, buddy. I'll kill you too!

    dialogue: Hm, Spider, Hubble, Nitrogum...ooh, Big Pink! It's the only gum with
      the breath-freshening power of ham.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And it pinkens your teeth while you chew.
  - character: CLERK
    dialogue: Alright, sergeant, $100 worth of pixie stix and porno mags with your
      5% military discount comes to $95.  That'll be 40 cents.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I believe you're forgetting about our 5% military discount.
  - character: CLERK
    dialogue: Well that's only for people in the military.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What?! This is the worst kind of discrimination. The kind against me!
  - character: CLERK
    dialogue: Alright, look. Our policy is, if for any reason you're not completely
      satisfied, I hate you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: OK, now I'm mad.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Full price for gum? That dog won't hunt, Monsignor.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hello. We're here because we...uh...love our planet!
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: Sign here on the dotted line, patriots. Then I'll give you your discount
      cards.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Just out of curiosity, we could use the cards to buy gum, then immediately
      quit the army, right?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You know, playing you all for chumps?
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: Correct. There's no obligation.  Unless, of course, war were declared.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's that?
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: War were declared.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Now be careful, Fry. And if you kill anyone, make sure to eat their
      heart, to gain their courage. Their rich, tasty courage.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: I don't want you to worry about your jobs while you're away. That's
      why I'm firing you now.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I wanna enlist. My friends always die if I'm not there to save them.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Sorry, but the army's instituted a men-only policy.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What?!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: It's shameful, I agree. In the olden days, I proudly fought alongside
      female troops, shoulder to, uh, shoulder. Alas, after a series of deadly blunders
      caused by distracting low-cut fatigues and lots of harmless pinching, the army
      decided women weren't fit for service. Not when I'm in charge.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You know, Zapp, someone ought to teach you a lesson.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: If it's a lesson in love, watch out. I suffer from a very sexy learning
      disability. What do I call it, Kif?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Sex-lexia.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Men, you're lucky men. Soon you'll all be fighting for your planet.
      Many of you will be dying for your planet. A few of you will be forced through
      a fine mesh screen for your planet. They will be the luckiest of all.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Great, we're gonna die.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And this ham gum is all bone.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Now to present the logistics of our mission, the Commander-in-Chief.
      Please welcome the original Gerber Baby, Earth President Richard M. Nixon.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: This is the brass ring, fellas......planet Spheron 1!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Cool effect!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: It's a desolate, ugly little planet with absolutely no natural resources
      or strategic value. Questions?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Don't ask me, you're the one who's going to be dying.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, just so we'll know, who's the enemy?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: 'A valid question.  We know nothing about their language, their history
      or what they look like. But we can assume this: They stand for everything we
      don''t stand for. Also, they told me you guys look like dorks.'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: They look like dorks!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: What's the matter, private? Tent got your tongue? (chuckling) Tent got
      your... (talking) Kif, write that down and send it to Humour In Uniform.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Whoa! Check out that guy. He makes Speedy Gonzales look like Regular
      Gonzales.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: That new recruit is phenomenal, sir.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Yes. He edged out my old mark by two seconds......and 16 minutes...and
      12 hours. I do plan to finish someday, Kif. Good hustle, soldier.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (disguised, deeper voice) Uh, sorry, sir. I was still in attack mode.
      You know how testosterone is.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: As a bubbling Crock-Pot of male hormones, I sure do. What's your name,
      private?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (disguised, deeper voice) Lee --  ..la...man. La Man...Lemon! Lee Lemon,
      sir.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Lemon, you're a man's man. You're a man's man's man. More importantly,
      your hand, while firm and masculine, is soft as a velvet child. What lotion
      do you use?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (disguised, deeper voice) Pert and Popular, sir.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Roger that. Kif, get me ten cases of Pert and Popular.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: What shall I do with your Jergens, sir?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Squirt it on some homeless man with dry elbows.  Private Lee Lemon may
      well be the finest recruit I've seen in all my years of service. That young
      man fills me with hope and some other emotions that are weird and deeply confusing
      to me.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Ew.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: (sexfully) Hello!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: "Mmm. Now that's a nice ros\xE9. So, anyway, we open up the panda crate,\
      \ wouldn't you know it, the damn thing's dead! Up-chucked it's bamboo. True\
      \ story."
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Uh-huh, uh-huh. That's whatever you were talking about for you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Mind if we sit with you?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (disguised, deeper voice) Uh, hey, why the hell would I? We're all guys
      here. Sweaty, hairy, gassy guys.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Good point...I guess.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You're my kind of soldier, Lemon. A foul-mouthed, barrel-chested, beer-bellied
      pile of ugly muscle.
  - character: HICK
    dialogue: So. Any you fellas got a special lady back home?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, I sort of a have a thing for this girl I work with.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Really? (disguised, deeper voice) What type is she? You know, blonde,
      or Chinese, or cyclops?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Cyclops.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (disguised, deeper voice) Aw, she sounds sweet.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But sweet girls aren't for you, eh? You hard-fighting, hard-farting,
      ugly, ugly son of a --
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (disguised, deeper voice) Stop! Stop flattering me!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: (shouting) Ten hut!  Well, well, well. If it isn't Lee Lemon. The flaming
      star of Brannigan's Rough Rangers. Say, uh, Lemon, do you like to read? I just
      got a great book on tape. It's about life in ancient Greece and --
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (disguised, deeper voice) Sir, the alarm. I think I'd better --
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Shh. Don't talk. Just go.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: We are now in position above Spheron 1. This is the moment we were training
      for all yesterday afternoon.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: And now for the battle plan. As you all know, the key to victory is
      the element of surprise. Surprise!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's creepy here.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And then the battle's not so bad?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's happening?
  - character: HICK
    dialogue: Holy shoot! Looky!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: The enemy! They're balls!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Charge your gun, Fry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, right.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Watch where you're shooting, private. You spooked Felicity.  There,
      there, boy.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You got it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, I think your son might also like those boots.
  - character: HICK
    dialogue: Cover us, buddy. You've got the only wounded-up positron shooter.  Fry,
      you emu-bellied coward!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) Bender! No!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: If they put me on a stamp, tell them to use the young Bender.
  - character: NURSE
    dialogue: Are you ready to operate, doctor?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery.  I kid, I kid!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Scalpel.  Blood bucket.  Priest. Next patient.
  - character: IHAWK
    dialogue: Gee, Zoidberg. Leave some for the enemy to kill.
  - character: NURSE
    dialogue: Leave Dr. Zoidberg alone. He has twice the training you do.
  - character: IHAWK
    dialogue: Yeah, he's a doctor and a butcher!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: See, this is how it starts. First with he jokes, then comes the heavy
      stuff.
  - character: IHAWK
    dialogue: When will the killing end?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Look at this sissy, Kif. While others were fighting and dying pointlessly,
      he was hiding in a hole, wallowing in a pool of his own cowardice.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That wasn't cowardice.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I'm depromoting you, soldier. Kif, what's the most humiliating job there
      is?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Being your assistant.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Wrong! Being your assistant! Private Fry, you will henceforth serve
      as Kif's assistant.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That doesn't sound too bad.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: (uncharacteristically nasty) You speak when I tell you to, you filthy
      worm!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I'm afraid he's gone.
  - character: HICK
    dialogue: Whoa, doc, I ain't dead.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Excuse me, I believe I'm the doctor.
  - character: IHAWK
    dialogue: Believe it all you want, that won't make it true.  (mauldlin) This isn't
      a war, it's a murder.  (irreverent) This isn't a war, it's a moider!
  - character: HICK
    dialogue: Bender, old buddy. Hang in there.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Here lies the bravest soldier I've seen since my mirror got grease on
      it. I hereby order that in Bender's honour, he be melted down and made into
      a statue of himself.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Slow down there, Starsky, I'm up to something here. I want this robot
      fixed. Fixed like Kennedy fixed the 1960 election. Damn bean-eating war hero!
  - character: NURSE
    dialogue: Are you read to operate, doctor?
  - character: IHAWK
    dialogue: I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: That's my joke! I'll kill you!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Ah! Pre-war scotch!  Welcome, Lieutenant Bender. You're looking sharp.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I got wheels! With clickety-clack-ers.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Damnit, Kif, where's the little umbrella? That's what makes it a scotch-on-the-rocks!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Actually, sir --
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Make me a new one.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Use a brush, you dunderhead! And mix these mixed nuts. I see two almonds
      touching!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Now, listen here, Bender. This war is in danger of going all quagmire
      on me. So I'm sending you on one last mission.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hot diggidy daffodil!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: A mission of peace.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (disappointed) Oh!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: You'll be negotiating with the aliens' mysterious leaders, the Brain
      Balls. They've got a lot of brains and they've got a lot of cutzpa!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Accompanying you will be our top peace negotiator, Henry Kissenger.
  - character: KISSENGER
    dialogue: How are you?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Is he any good?
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Looking like that, he talked his way into Jill St. John's bed. Nuff
      said!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: (singing) I'm so dizzy, my head is spinning. Like a whirlpool it never
      ends.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: A little lower. Lower. Lower. A lot lower. Too low...! Lower!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (singing) I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Private Lemon, no need to leave.  My stall just became free.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (disguised, deeper voice) Maybe you should put on a towel, sir.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Right. Right!  I'm about to try the new lotion you recommended. (sexfully)
      If I should accidentally put too much on my hands, perhaps I could rub it onto
      you.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Brannigan!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Hm?
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: My God, cover yourself. I didn't live a thousand years and travel a
      quadrillion miles to look at another man's gizmo.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Uh, sorry, Mr. President, I didn't realise. Kif, raise him up about
      nipple-high.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Come on, Brannigan. Stuff yourself into a uniform. We've gotta get off
      this planet before the bomb goes off.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (disguised, deeper voice) Bomb?! What bomb?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: The one we had the doctors implant in that gullible Bender robot.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Zapp. Zapp!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Hm?
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Inspect the troops later. It's time to activate the bomb.
  - character: KISSENGER
    dialogue: Now, as for economic cooperation --
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa! Scuse me.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Come along, Lemon before this whole dump blows up.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (disguised, deeper voice) Uh, commander? Could you tell me when the
      bomb is exploding?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Of course, my significant soldier. The bomb is voice activated. It will
      detonate the instant the robot unwittingly speaks a certain word.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's the word...uh...sir?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: 'It''s the one word the robot uses more than any other. We got it from
      this convenient database of his 10 most frequently-used words.  Number 10, chump;
      number nine, chumpette; number eight, yours; number seven, up; number six, pimpmobile;
      number five, bite; number four, my......number three, shiny; number two, daffodil.
      And Bender''s number one most frequently uttered word, the word which, if uttered,
      will blow up this entire planet: Ass.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We don't have long!
  - character: KISSENGER
    dialogue: Say what?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: My chair's too hard. It's a real pain in the...uh, whattya call it?
      Lower back! Yeah, that whole region.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: OK, I gotta break down that gate, beat up those three guards, steal
      that chopper and rescue Bender.  Hey, I did it! Wait, that's not me.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) Come on. We gotta save Bender.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You wanna save him too, Lemon? You barely know him.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, don't you recognise me?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hermes?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Lee? When will I see you again?  The two of you are good friends? But
      I thought we would be good friends. (contemptuous) Well, let's see how friendly
      you get when you're sharing a prison cell!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey, Zapp!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Leela!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: So it's you I've been attracted to! Oh, God, I've never been so happy
      to be beaten up by a woman.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Let's do it again sometime.
  - character: KISSENGER
    dialogue: Mr. Ambassador, our people tell the same story. Oy.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: These balls are making me testy. If they don't stop bouncing and jiggling,
      I swear I'm gonna shove this treaty up their -- Wait a second. Where do you
      shove things up a ball?
  - character: KISSENGER
    dialogue: This isn't a productive area of discussion.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We're here. I followed the bouncing balls.  I'll keep the chopper at
      a safe altitude while you parachute down.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: OK, my best friend's life is at stake. I can finally prove that I'm
      not a coward. Will you push me?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) I already did!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) Thank you!  At last, war has made me into a man.
  - character: KISSENGER
    dialogue: Please, gentlemen. We must put an end to the bloodshed. We have all
      seen too many body bags and ball sacks.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Enough of this crap! I'm catching the next pimpmobile outta here! But
      before I go I have one thing to say.  Bite my shiny metal --
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Stop! You can't say the next word.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Up yours, chump, I said it 906 times before lunch.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender, if you say the A-word and you'll blow this planet straight to
      the H-word!
  - character: KISSENGER
    dialogue: Young man, you have the bravery of a hero and breath as fresh as a summer
      ham.  What? What is funny?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Bender's got the upper hand now.  The name of the game is "Make Bender
      Happy Or He Blows Up The Planet".  I'd rather die and take everybody with me
      than sit here one more minute listening to these idiots talk about bouncing!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's it, I'm saying it! A is for --
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: All right! Hey. Wait a minute! This is your home planet? We're the evil,
      invading aliens?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'Then I guess you learned a valuable lesson: Don''t mess with Earth.'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Get the hell off my planet.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well, that's it. Let's reactivate him. (shouting) Wake up!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, chumps and chumpettes. Did you get the bomb out? Can I go back
      to saying the word I love to say?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I'm sorry but we couldn't remove it.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It's stuck in there with glue or something. I don't know.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (ironic) Well, this is just great! What's the point of living if I can't
      say "ass"? Hey, I didn't blow up! Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass! Alright! I'm back
      in the saddle!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We couldn't disarm the bomb so we reset the word that triggers it.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: It's from the list of words you almost never say.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's using your ass. So, what's the word?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: We think it's better if you don't know.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, come on. I'm not gonna say it. Please? Oh, is it "please"?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hm, words I never say. Oh, I know! "Thanks"!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, stop trying to destroy the world.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it "sorry"? No. "Funderful"? Uh, "nonalcoholic"?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Quit it!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Stop it, mon!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Enough already!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (from lab) "Compassion"? "Shrimptoast"? "Antiquing"?  I'm alright!

    dialogue: Giant Space Robot, this is Captain Fry of the USS Planet Express Ship;
      We come in peace.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Tough luck!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, we destroyed the toy spaceship. Now what are we gonna do?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, look! The keys to the real spaceship.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Do you think we should?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (firmly) Yes, I do.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Leela, have you seen the keys to the spaceship?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I must've left them onboard.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Eh, wha'? I mean, what?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Relax. The ship's not going anywhere. I anchored it with the unbreakable
      diamond tether.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh, no!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Sweet ghost of Babylon.
  - character: ZOIDBERG

    dialogue: Woo-hoo!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, Fry, I'm steering with my ass!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's the best thing I ever saw!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That was great!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And no one suspects a thing!  Whoa! And that's how we learned our lesson!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You've gone too far this time - all three of you!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What did I do?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You left the keys in the ignition. I mean, look at those two. Wasn't
      it obvious what would happen?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, Leela.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: We're all very disappointed in you.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I should fire you three right now, but I'm just not that cold-hearted.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: You're all fired.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Goodbye, friends. I'll miss you.  Good riddance to them. Now Zoidberg
      is the popular one!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes, yes! Let's all talk to Zoidberg.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, I've been thinking. Do you think we could go out?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: So, Zoidberg. What's new?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: 'Tell me, Zoidberg: Is it carapace or carapass?'
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Oh, you know...!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What are we supposed to do for money? All I've got is my frequent taffy
      eater's card, my first moustache......and this picture of me and my old girlfriend,
      Michelle, and that ski instructor she was just friends with.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Pardon me, brother. Care to donate to the Anti-Mugging-You Fund?  Ow!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We don't need to beg, Bender. For God's sake, we're not veterans!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, what do you suggest? A daring daylight robbery of Fort Knox on
      elephant-back? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No, we can get jobs.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But we just had jobs!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fortunately, I still have our old career chips.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Our what?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Career chips.  You remember? They assign you the job you're best at.  I
      tried to give you one and you ran away.  It's how we met!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And then what happened?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Just give me your hand.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Baby!  Ow!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'I''d like to reapply for my old job: Counselling defrostees and assigning
      them careers.'
  - character: IPGEE
    dialogue: Oh, I was hoping you would come back! I even saved your poster of a
      chimp expressing your distaste for Mondays.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Monday Monkey lives for the weekend, sir.
  - character: IPGEE
    dialogue: Just put your hand under the scanner so I can verify your career chip.  Calcutta,
      we have a problem.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Delivery boy? I must have mixed up the chips. It's a simple mis -
  - character: IPGEE
    dialogue: Oh, here's a cryogenic counsellor! Do you like Mondays?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: They're OK.
  - character: IPGEE
    dialogue: Then we'll have to redecorate your office. How do you feel about it
      helping to be crazy to work here but not being necessary?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, let's see what it says about me.
  - character: IPGEE
    dialogue: Welcome aboard, sir.
  - character: TERRY
    dialogue: Remember, when the tube opens, say...(dramatically)..."Welcome to the
      world of tomorrow!"
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, I was frozen. I think I know what people wanna hear when they first
      wake up.  Bathroom's that way.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So, while you're on the Probulator, tell me, what brings you to the
      future?
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: Oh, well, I wanted to meet Shakespeare and I figured that time was cyclical.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Nope. Straight line.  Ah, the Probulator's done.
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: That wasn't so bad.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, wait, it hasn't started yet.  OK, it's about to start.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Welcome to the future, human slave. Ah, relax, chum. I'm not really
      a giant fly!  I'm a horrible robot!  Kill all humans!
  - character: TERRY
    dialogue: Dear God! He's having a heart attack!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah, they'll probably find a cure for that in the future.
  - character: TERRY
    dialogue: We have a cure for it now!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, good. Then you won't mind if I use this.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Nothing like a power nap.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Stay beautiful, doll-face!  That Probulator sure knows how to please
      a man. So, what's for lunch?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I ordered a pizza.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Pizza delivery for...I.C. Wiener.  Yeah, very funny. Now cough up the
      $12.95.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sorry, but if it's not here in half an hour, it's free.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's only been 23 minutes.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, uh, I've got 33 minutes.
  - character: CHEF
    dialogue: It's only been-a 23 minutes, you dumb-a canolli. You got a problem,
      we can take it outside.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: OK, I'll fight the box. I think I can take him.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, just pay me. I still owe 30 bucks on this uniform.
  - character: CHEF
    dialogue: 35, you stupid meatball.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Who should be unfreeze next?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No.  No!  Oh, my God! It's Pauly Shore!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Alright!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Mr. Shore, I loved you in Bio-Dome. You sure caused some trouble in
      that bubble!
  - character: SHORE
    dialogue: Rest assured, if it rhymes, I can cause trouble in it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, now that you're in the future, you can go live in an actual bio-dome!
  - character: SHORE
    dialogue: An unattractive prospect. While researching for the role, I ran computer
      simulations demonstrating, incontravertably, that the whole bio-enclosure concept
      is fundamentally flawed. Be it expressed via dome, sphere, cube or even a stately
      tetrahedron, buuuddy!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh.  How did you wind up getting frozen?
  - character: SHORE
    dialogue: 'Well, while filming Encino Man my intellectual curiosity re: cryogenics
      was peaked, and I resolved to freeze the weasel.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: The weasel?
  - character: SHORE
    dialogue: Hey, listen, skippy. I was supposed to be unfrozen in Hollywood for
      the thousandth anniversary screening of Jury Duty II. How come I'm not there?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I woke you up early so we could hang out and do stuff.
  - character: SHORE
    dialogue: Like what?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I love this job.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Me too.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Showtime! (hoarse) I'll pretend to be dying of space plague.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Boo?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Michelle!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, my God!
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: Fry? Is it really you?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't know. Is it really you?
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: What do you mean you don't know? Are you you or not?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Who wants to know?
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: Oh, Fry, it is you!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't get it, Michelle. The last time I saw you, you were doing great.
      You had just dumped me and you were well on your way to getting you life back
      on track. Why'd you freeze yourself?
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: Oh, Fry. After you left, things took a turn for the worse. I got married.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm sorry.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: (voice-over) His name was Charles. He attended a law school so prestigious,
      the basketball team was coached by Ruth Bader Ginsberg.  I put him through law
      school by working as a dog walker for antisocial dogs.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sorry.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: (voice-over) But soon after Charles graduated, our marriage ran into
      difficulties.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, sorry.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: '(voice-over) Desperately depressed, I turned to the one thing that
      could lessen my pain: A carnival. Unfortunately, a corn dog bone got lodged
      in the control panel of the Spizzler, and I had to ride it for eight hours.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (voice-over) Sorry.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: (voice-over) But it did give me a chance to think...
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm sorry.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: '...and I remembered the last time I was truly happy; When I was with
      you.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aww. So you froze yourself to come look for me?
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: No, I did it to get a fresh start. I didn't know what had happened to
      you - no one did. The police were going to conduct a search but your parents
      felt it was a waste of taxpayer money.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's the same reason they kept me out of school. So, no one even cared
      that I was gone?
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: Not really. Except for one person.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Who was it?
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: Everything is so different.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Not everything. There's still a roach problem.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: Ew!
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: Eurgh.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Nowadays, people aren't interested in art that's not tattooed on fat
      guys.
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: I'm on loan from the Louvre.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Please, professor. Give us our jobs back. We deserve another chance.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, and if you won't give me another chance, perhaps you'd give one
      to......Og, gorilla emperor of Earth!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I'm sorry, Og, but I've got a new crew.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: So, how was delivery to Fantasy Planet, where everyone's fantasies come
      to life?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Great!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Organised!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: For one beautiful night, I knew what it was to be a grandmother. Subjugated,
      yet honoured.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You see, Og? Everything's running smoothly, yes. And with Fry fired,
      I can finally leave my jigsaw puzzles out without him eating the pieces.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Forget about Fry. You can hire us back and he'd never have to know.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, guys.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh. Hey, Fry!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So, as Leela was saying, Fry can go shove a big old - Ow!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm glad you're all here. I wanted to introduce you to my on-again-off-again
      girlfriend of the past thousand years, Michelle.  Michelle, this is Leela. This
      is Bender.  The professor.  Hermes and Amy.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: Nice to meet you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And this is Dr. Zoidberg.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Dating you ex, Fry? Have you lost all self-respect?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: All what?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: This can only end badly, Fry. Kids, a house -
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: A home invasion by a former roommate.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But things are different this time. Before, she was demanding and possessive.
      But now she wants me to do stuff and stay with her all the time.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: There you go, dearies.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: It's a relief to meet you, Amy. I'm just having a hard time adjusting
      to all the strange stuff here in the future.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I'm from Mars.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: I feel so out of place here. I don't understand why Fry fits in so well.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Probably because he didn't fit in back in your time.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: That's true. But I used to fit in really well.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Then good luck, sister.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but your friends are a bunch of
      freaks.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, they're great, huh?
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: I just don't belong here. I don't know anyone, I can't find a vanishing
      cream that doesn't make me actually vanish. I don't even have a job.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, right. I was supposed to assign you a job. Let me just get your
      career chip installed.  Hold out your palm. What are you scared of? It's just
      like getting your hand pierced.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: This world is horrible. Let's start over, Fry. Well go someplace where
      all we have is each other.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ooh, romantic. I'll tell Bender to meet us there.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: It's not a "there". It's a "then". The future.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Whoa, whoa, girl. I thought you were talking about one of those motels
      where the bed is shaped like stuff.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: I love you. Don't you love me?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, sure. To the extent a man can love a woman. But this seems like
      a big step.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: Fry, why must you analyse everything with your relentless logic? Nothing
      matters but our love.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You're right. Let's do this now and let's never regret it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Michelle, I don't regret this. But I both rue and lament it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: The year 4000 is severely disappointing. I miss the year 3000 when life
      was simple and brains flew through space and everyone ate lasers.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: It's not that bad. Fate brought us together and now fate brought us
      here.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, you brought us here.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: Whine some more, Fry, I really find that attractive in a man. Now come
      on, build us a shelter.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Alright, fine. Everything else sucks. At least we can have a nice place
      to live.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ooh, there.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: You expect me to live in a tiny little hole?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It'd be deeper, but I'm standing on a gopher.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: Oh, look. Some little kids.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: They'll save us.  We're saved!
  - character: BUTCH
    dialogue: I'm Butch, leader of this place. I took your hole and you can't do nothing
      about it.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: OK.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Mighty sir, we have nowhere to go. Could we please join your society?
  - character: BUTCH
    dialogue: Well, alright. But no interfering with our grand works.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I tell you, that Butch runs a pretty good civilisation. I think I'll
      enjoy serving under him.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: You know your problem, Fry? You're not ambitious. You should be chief.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What do I need, ulcers?
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: But I want power. I'm tired of the chief's girlfriend lording it over
      me with her fancy coyote hide.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Alright, alright. If it'll make you happy, I'll overthrow society.
  - character: BUTCH
    dialogue: On what grounds do you challenge my authority?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, I'm older than you. I can beat you up.
  - character: BUTCH
    dialogue: Alright, grandpa. There's only one way to settle this. Death rolling!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's death rolling?
  - character: OROWHEAT
    dialogue: It's like skateboarding.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, so it's a little safer than skateboarding.
  - character: BUTCH
    dialogue: Last one holding the bandana's the new leader.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: My mother always said you were a loser, Fry. Now get out there and prove
      her wrong.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (sadly) Beth said that?
  - character: BUTCH
    dialogue: It's cool. Back off.  (crying) My knee. I scraped it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aww. Poor little guy. Let me just take a look at - aha!  I won! I'm
      the new chief! I'm the tallest and I weigh the most!
  - character: BUTCH
    dialogue: Hand it over, you giant idiot.
  - character: BUTCH
    dialogue: Aw, man.
  - character: OROWHEAT
    dialogue: I don't wanna go.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland very confusing. Seriously, I'm
      weirded out.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: That's because you're a loser. You were a loser in the year 2000 and
      you're a loser in the year 4000.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it all. Several friends, a low-paying
      job, a bed in a robot's closet. I envied no man. But you wrecked everything.
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: Quit standing up for yourself, Fry. When we get back to the hole, we
      are going to have a long, boring talk about our relationship!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'Oh, yeah? Well, listen to this: (whispering) I''m leaving you.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: There must be people somewhere.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yes! Footprints! And hand prints?  But? What's happening?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, thank God we found you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela? What are you guys doing here in the year 4000?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's not the year 4000.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You were only frozen for two days. Uh, by the way, I broke your bed.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You were in Pauly Shore's tube and they were delivering it to his movie
      screening.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But, when they noticed you weren't him, they chucked you in a ditch.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So you're saying these aren't the decaying ruins of New York in the
      year 4000?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You wish! You're in Los Angeles!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But there was this gang of 10-year olds with guns.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'Exactly: You''re in L.A.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But everyone is driving around in cars shooting at each other.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's L.A.. for you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But the air's green and there's no sign of civilisation whatsoever.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: He just won't stop with the social commentary.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And the people are all phoneys. No one reads. Everything has cilantro
      on it -  Michelle, baby!
  - character: MICHELLE
    dialogue: It's not working out, Fry.
  - character: SHORE
    dialogue: (shouting) Tis better to have loved and lost, n'est ce-pas?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's it. I've had it with women. From now on, I'm concentrating on
      my career. Can I have my old job back?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Why, I've forgotten why I even fired you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: '''Cause he destroyed your business, your home and all your possessions.'
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, that's right. Get lost.

    dialogue: Hey jumbo! How would you like it if Leela said you were sexy and she
      wanted to make love with you?
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: Eh, I gots five minutes. She looks pretty good for a truck stop chick!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You take that back! She does not look good for a truck stop chick!
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: Yeah you're right. She don't gots enough meat for a guy like me.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: She does too! She's loaded with meat! She's got more meat than a cow!  Ow!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I can't please Leela no matter what I do! I just want her to like me.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well there's always hope.  C'mon we gotta go fix the plasma fusion boiler.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Who are you?
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: Scruffy. The janitor.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well why aren't you fixing the boiler?
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: Schedule conflict.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: There. Fixed forever.
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: Scruffy's gonna die the way he lived. Oh marmalade!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Oh the hypochondriac's back. So what is it this time?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well my lead pipe hurts a little?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: That's normal. Next patient.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: He's a witch!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Fry, did you eat anything unusual recently?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What about that bathroom egg salad from the truck stop?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I've had better.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Egg salad? Hmm. Zoidberg will have to examine your gastrointestinal
      tract. Come everyone, give Fry some privacy.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: If you can't see well enough through the two-way mirror, there'll be
      a close-up on this video screen.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Hmm. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.  Guess again.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Gross!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Watch for any subtle irregularity in Fry's bowel.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: It's gorgeous. That place used to be a big dump.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, eww!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Worms? Eww! Puke-a-tronic!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So the eggs in that egg salad sandwich were -
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Correct! Worm eggs! And the mayonaise was probably none too fresh either.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: It's nauseating man!  Is there no way to get rid of the disgusting maggots?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Only one. We'll have to travel deep inside Fry, in this!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Shotgun!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: In each gastro-survival kit, you'll find a rain slicker, a disposable
      fun camera, and something to protect you against bacteria.... - a harpoon!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yo, old guy. Why do we have to use those tiny micro-droids? Can't you
      just shrink us?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh my no. That would require extrememly tiny atoms. And have you priced
      those lately? I'm not made of money - leave me alone!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Me next!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Anyhoo, your net suits will let you experience Fry's worm-infested bowels
      as if you were actually wriggling through them.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: There's no part of that sentence I didn't like.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Is everyone present?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Right on!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh-huh.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Definately.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Yes.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: 'Heres the plan:  We''ll enter the ear, drip down the back of the throat
      and make for the bowel. There, we''ll irritate the pelvic splachnic ganglion
      and cause an intestinal spasm, expelling - among other things - the parasites.'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'll tell Fry to wash out - among other things - his ear.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No, Fry can't know anything about the mission. If he finds out, the
      worms will try to defend themselves. They know everything he knows.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: They know how to make ice cream soup?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Leela, your role is to distract Fry so he doesn't notice what we're
      up to.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Leela, you should really try a facial scrubs, for your pores.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look! A starling!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What about what?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh...what if we go for a walk possibly because it's such a lovely day,
      perhaps.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'd love to!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: We gotta get someplace where he won't stick his finger!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's hopeless! Abandon ship!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Wait, we just have to get past the eardrum!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious how an aromatic chain of hydrocarbons
      can evoke our deepest emotions.  For you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's such a beautiful thought Fry. And what's more amazing you expressed
      it without spewing crumbs at me!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Brace yourselves everyone. We're entering the interior of Fry's nose!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: We're at finger alert five.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Let's just pray nothing stimulates the delicate smell receptors. (whispering)
      Nobody make a smell.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Quick! We can escape through that nasal capillary into the sinus.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Strange. Usually you don't know anything about human anatomy.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I learned it from a decongestant commercial. (echoing) "Soothing action,
      action, action action..."
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Where are we, the ass?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: We're in the heart. Better known as "the love muscle."
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Where the food is digested.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: We should be safe, just so long as nothing makes it beat faster.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Abandon ship!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No! Set course for that cholesterol-encrusted valve.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: It's good cholesterol but it spreads like bad cholesterol!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: He'll be as strong and flexible as Gumbo and Hercules combined!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Gumbercules? I love that guy!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Ugh! It's that jerk from the truck stop! Let's cross the street and
      try to blend in with that crowd of pimps.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't think so.  Sir, I believe you owe this lady an apology.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry no! He's bulging with what could be muscles!  Ooo!
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: I gots your apologys right heres!  Sorrys ma'am. I've learnsed a lesson
      about not ogling cans that I won't soons forgets.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Abandon ship!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No, don't give up now! we're but a stones throw from the pyloric sphinchter.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: There it is! The stately capitol of Fry's bowel. A heavily guarded fortress
      surrounding the pelvic splachnic ganglion.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I've heard of that, who said I haven't?!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: If we can stimulate that nerve, the bowel will convulse, expelling the
      entire worm society.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: But what about the worms in the other parts of his body?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Listen, this is gonna be one hell of a bowel movement. Afterwards he'll
      be lucky if he has any bones left!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: All right, let's mush some worms!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I had a great time today. The flowers, the puddle, the way you hurt
      that guy. But can I ax you something?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Anything.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Why did you do all that stuff?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela, there's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time but
      every time I try I get nervous and my mouth feels like it's stuffed with peanut
      butter, even when it's not.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What is it? Is it about Bender?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, it's about you and me.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: And Bender?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender's not involved.  Leela...I love you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You do?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yes. But it's only recently I've been able to articulate my thoughts.
      I love you Leela and I always have.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, that's the sweetest, most wonderful - wait! Recently? Like since
      you ate that toilet sandwich?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah! I don't know why but my life really turned around that day!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Stay here.
  - character: WAITRESS
    dialogue: Freshen your nocatina?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Please......I need something to settle my stomach.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: The nerve is through here. Where's Zoidberg?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Yippie-ki-yay! You'll never guess where I've been!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: There it is! The pelvic splachnic ganglion. Tickle it and get ready
      for the ride of your lives!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Don't even think about tickling that ganglion!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Leela, you're just in time to help. If we don't get rid of the worms
      now, they'll burrow so deep into the bowel that not even Hermes' famous jerk
      prunes could dislodge them!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: I call it "Carribean Drain-o"!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Fry will be stuck with the worms forever.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Perfect.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Ouch!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I'm OK.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Leela you ignorant dope! Now the worms will be in Fry forever.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So? Did you ever stop to think that Fry is better off with worms?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh that's stupid!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: If anyone wants to tell me what's going on here, I'll be in the lounge.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Of all the parasites I've had over the years, these worms are among
      the - hell! They are the best! Leela, how can I ever repay you for saving them?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: '''Ello! What''s all this then?'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Apartment 1I. The old me would have made a joke about that!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm thinking of having a window installed.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I think the view's perfect already.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, that's the corniest thing I've ever heard! Let me show you the bedroom.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait. In a minute.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: A holophonor? Only a few people in the whole universe can play that.
      And they're not very good at it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: They don't have you to inspire them.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't have words to say how wonderful you are Fry. I haven't felt
      this happy since double-soup Tuesday at the orphanarium.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: When I'm with you, everyday seems like double-soup Tuesday.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh Fry, I love what you've become.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What I've become.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What is it?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: There's just something I have to find out.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Who controls this bowel?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You mean colon?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Your excellency, have you ever been in love?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, a wonderful girl loves me. But I need to know if it's really me
      she loves, or just what you worms have made of me. That's why with all due respect,
      I'm asking you to leave.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Everyone out of my body or the brain gets it!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Obviously you've never been in love! Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Now, the hand-eye
      co-ordination lobe.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I was just working my way towards the medulla oblongata - control centre
      of the heart and lungs. And if I kill myself, you die with me.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I hope Satan has a nice colon, 'cause that's where you're gonna be living!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry? I missed you. Did you find out what you needed to find out?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm about to.  Leela, let me play for you one for time.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You don't have to do that. I'm still seduced from before.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Please, it's important to me.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What's that supposed to mean?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't know. I got nervous and started thinking about neck bolts.  Wow!
      Did you see that vase break? It was all like -
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What's happened to you?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Nothing. I got rid of the worms.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What? Why would you do that?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela, I had worms. I needed to know who you loved. Me or them.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well...which of you wrote me that sonnet?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I did. I think. It was probably about 50/50. But that's how I really
      felt about you, I swear!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't know.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Please. Give me a chance to be romantic on my own. I've got a baggy
      of massage oil, and I'm gonna give you my super back rub, just like a I used
      to give Amy when I was going out with her, and she always seemed... - Uh-oh!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Sorry you struck out sausage link. If it's any consolation, my life
      is great! Babes! Bucks! I got it all!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, at least I learned Leela's a lost cause. I give up.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: There you go!  Goodnight. I gotta get up early to go parasailing with
      movie stars!

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, so has Fry. What's the big deal?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: He's got me beat!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Now well all love Nibbler, so it's only fair that we all pitch in and
      clean it up together. Still, I propose we make Zoidberg do it. All in favour?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Alright, yup.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: All opposed?  All abstaining?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Dr. Zoidberg? Are you OK?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: He's dead.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh no!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: He always seemed so full of life. Laughing, singing, begging for scraps.
      And now this.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Why with all the crying?  So that's where I left my shell.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I didn't know you could take this thing off.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: It was starting to get a little cramped in there so I molted, why not?
      Ah, the fresh air feels good!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Stop doing that!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: So long. I'm off to toss this old shell in the dumpster and maybe pick
      up those potato chips Amy didn't finish yesterday.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Those were toenail clippings.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: A feast is a feast.

    dialogue: Hey, that's my cellphone!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hello?  Hello? Who is this?  Hello? Hello?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What's wrong? Did you swallow your phone again?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Some guy's been calling and hanging up 10 times a day for a year.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Men who call too much are the worst ... I bet.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I just wish a decent guy would call me instead of this spleeze-ball
      who has me too terrified to even answer the phone.  Hello?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hello? Is anyone there?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: I love you.  Why must I be such a coward?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Kif, I'm headed to the men's room and I'll be needing an attendant so--
      Oh, I'm sorry. You're crying like a woman. It's alright. I've always thought
      myself as a father figure to some of my more pathetic men. Kif, old friend,
      let's rap.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Well, I'm in love with this girl--
  - character: ZAPP

      directly into a black hole.

    dialogue: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Mm-hmm, uh-huh.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: I've finished talking, sir.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Belay that remark!  Your Amy knows my Leela? I have formed an idea!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I'm calling to negotiate a double date. You and me, Kif and Amy.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Forget it.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Then let the negotiations begin. I propose we go out on 10 dates.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: How about zero?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Nine.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Zero.

  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Um, sir? I don't go out on many dates and, um, what if I can't think
      of anything to say?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Here's my personal book of pickup lines. Say as many of them as you
      can as fast as you can. Don't stop for any reason.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Maybe I'll just give her these flowers.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Wrong, wrong, wrong! And what's that? Candy? Candy's for dorks! Give
      me that. Mmm!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Hello, beautiful. I got these for you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thanks.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Well, well. This looks to be one disturbingly erotic date.

  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Waiter, bring us a bottle of wine.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Half-bottle.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: And some oysters on the half-shell.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Quarter-shell.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh, and I'd like--
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Kif's not hungry. (quietly) Kif, this place is expensive. (talking)
      I'd like two steaks and the ladies will have some very sensual salads -- with
      low-cal sensual dressing.
  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: (singing) Oh, won't you take me to funkytown,
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Kif, you're so quiet. You haven't said a word all night.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Well, um, um ... hello.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: '''Cause I was really hoping we could talk and stuff.'
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Amy, (reading) if I said you had a beautiful body would you take your
      pants off and dance around a little?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: What?!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Lieutenant Kroker!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: (reading) I find the most erotic part of the woman is the boobies
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Kif!

    dialogue: Oh, my!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This half-date is entirely over. Amy? Conference!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Is there nothing we can do, sir?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: There's only one sure-fire way back into a woman's heart and parts beyond.
      I speak of course, of kareoke.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: (determined) My years in the DOOP Boys' Chorus will not have been in
      vain!

    dialogue: Oh, that's so emotional!
  - character: KIF

  - character: ZAPP

    dialogue: Get off!

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We're going home. Call us a space taxi.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: No need. There's not a restaurant built I can't fly. Where to, ladies?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Please, sir. Let's just divide up the check and--
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Let's see what this eatery can do.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Ah, she's built like a steakhouse, but she handles like a bistro.  She's
      out of control!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: (from inside) You win again, gravity!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: 'Look what arrived: My new shell catalogue. So let''s try some on already!  Ah!
      Muy macho! Hey, gringos! Here comes El Zoido to ruin your drinking water!'

      note of it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We gotta go rescue them!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Eh, I don't know.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: "Bender! Think of the se\xF1oritas!"
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: "V\xE1monos!"
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: So, Amy, um, well--
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: It's always a line with you!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What planet is this anyway?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: (mumbling) I 'unno. (talking) This whole sector is uncharted.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: It is not uncharted, you lost the chart!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Well, nothing to do now but repopulate the human race.  Just me and
      you!  (whispering) And maybe you.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: What is it?
  - character: KUG
    dialogue: Me hear people. But me not see people.
  - character: THOG
    dialogue: No big deal. Everybody make mistake.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Well, hello! I usually don't say this but you are the most beautiful
      trio of gigantic ladies I've ever laid eyes on.  (reading) I find the most erotic
      part of a woman is the boo--
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, no! Any sign of Leela or Amy?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No. But what do you make of this?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't know. But it might have something to do with this.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, your God!
  - character: KUG
    dialogue: Move! Go!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Alright, here's the plan--
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What kind of moronic plan is that? Wow!
  - character: THOG
    dialogue: Women go free. Men stay in chains.
  - character: ORNIK
    dialogue: We take them to our leader. She know what do.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Pfft. A female leader?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, shut up.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yes, captain!
  - character: THOG
    dialogue: This capital city planet Amazonia.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Where are all the men in your society?
  - character: ORNIK
    dialogue: Men die out many year ago.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: With all these women around they were probably nagged to death. Are
      you with me, fellas?
  - character: THOG
    dialogue: Here stadium, where our women basketball teams play.
  - character: KUG
    dialogue: We no can dunk, but good fundamentals.

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'Translation: Boring!  (laughing) That''s a good one!  Ow!'
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: This women-only planet is sounding better and better.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm already looking for apartments.
  - character: THOG
    dialogue: Here live vengeful, all-knowing leader. She decide men's fate.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Is she hot?
  - character: THOG
    dialogue: That not important. She all-knowing.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: In other words, "No".  Ow!
  - character: THOG
    dialogue: (chanting) All hail Femputer.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You all obey a big computer?
  - character: KUG
    dialogue: Yes. It appear mysteriously just about time men die out.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So why did you make it your leader?
  - character: ORNIK
    dialogue: It seemed like different kind of politician.
  - character: KUG
    dialogue: Not beltway insider.
  - character: THOG
    dialogue: Femputer, we bring offering of bath beads and scented soaps.
  - character: FEMPUTER
    dialogue: Your gift pleases Femputer. Femputer demands to know why there are men
      on her planet.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It was an accident, ma'am.
  - character: FEMPUTER
    dialogue: That does not fempute. Femputer will return after deciding your punishment.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela, I'm through making fun of women. Now I want them to help me.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Should we do something?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: There's no hurry.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Yes! A little tighter.  Tighter. Perhaps a hard spanking is in order?  Too
      hard!
  - character: KUG
    dialogue: Men strange. You have them on your planet?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (ashamed) I'm afraid so.
  - character: KUG
    dialogue: What they for?  Oh, you mean "snu-snu".
  - character: THOG
    dialogue: We hear tell men used for snu-snu. But all we have go on are ancient
      legend and subscription to Cosmo.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Just FYI, I could be used for snu-snu.
  - character: THOG
    dialogue: Silence. You want die like last men visit Amazonia?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What'd they die of?
  - character: KUG
    dialogue: Crushed pelvises.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yes!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Oh, thank you, Lord in heaven!
  - character: FEMPUTER
    dialogue: After lengthy femputations, I, Femputer, have decided the fate of the
      men. Femputer sentences them to death.  By snu-snu!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (cheering) Yay!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: (cheering) Yeah!  (talking) What are you, gay?
  - character: FEMPUTER
    dialogue: Death to the men. Death by snu-snu.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Although the snu-snu part's gonna be pretty good.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Baby, it'll blow your mind.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Femputer, be reasonable. Sure men are annoying and they wreck up whatever
      planet they're in charge of. But most of these men are sorta my friends. They
      don't deserve to die.
  - character: FEMPUTER
    dialogue: Hmm. Perhaps men are not as evil as Femputer thinks.
  - character: THOG
    dialogue: But they make fun women's basketball.
  - character: FEMPUTER
    dialogue: What?! Did you explain how the women's good fundamentals make up for
      their inability to dunk?
  - character: ORNIK
    dialogue: Yes. They still laugh.
  - character: FEMPUTER
    dialogue: The men must die.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Too true, Femputer. You're so wise. Kill 'em all, I say. Good riddance!
      Did I mention I'm not a man? I'm a manbot. It's an understandable mistake. You
      can let me down now, thanks.
  - character: KUG
    dialogue: He big jerk like man.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I sure am. But check the crotch.  Nothing.
  - character: FEMPUTER
    dialogue: Very well, release him. As for the others, take them to the snu-snu
      chambers.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) I'll miss you, meatbag.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Me too, meatbag.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Goodbye, friends. I never thought I would die like this. But I'd always
      really hoped.
  - character: AMAZONIANS
    dialogue: (chanting) Snu-snu, snu-snu, snu-snu!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: 'Amy. Before I die, I have to tell you: I didn''t mean to say those
      awful things on our date. They were all Zapp''s idea.'
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Really? Honest and true?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Yes. And-And that person calling and hanging up, was me. I was just
      too nervous to say hello because I love you.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh, Kif!
  - character: THOG
    dialogue: It Thog's first time.  Be gentle!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We've got to do something. Bender, maybe you can interface with the
      Femputer and reprogram it to let them go.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Maybe you can interface with my ass. By biting it!  Alright, I'll go!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (from inside) Ooh! Yeah!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: (from inside) Oh, baby!
  - character: FEMPUTER
    dialogue: Intruder! Stay away from the mighty Femputer! Guards!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Time to override the CPU and reprogram this Femputer.
  - character: FEMPUTER
    dialogue: Hey, whoa, whoa! Stop it! Stop it! Hey, cut that out!
  - character: FEMBOT
    dialogue: Cease hitting Femputer!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You're no Femputer, you're a Fembot!
  - character: FEMBOT
    dialogue: (ashamed) It's true. I disguised myself as a Femputer so I could rule
      the Amazonians.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But why?
  - character: FEMBOT
    dialogue: Why? Why? I came here from a faraway planet. A planet ruled by a chauvinistic
      Manputer that was really a Manbot. Have you any idea how it feels to be a Fembot
      living in a Manbot's Manputer's world?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What?
  - character: FEMBOT
    dialogue: And now, my meddling Manbot, there's the question of what to do with
      you!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: (gasping) We need rest. The spirit is willing but the flesh is spongy
      and bruised.
  - character: ORNIK
    dialogue: It time snu-snu!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Can't we just cuddle?  (screaming) Nooo!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We can't wait for Bender. It's time for a woman's touch.  Yah! Hi-yah!
      Yah, yah yah!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: (disguised, deeper voice) Me next snu-snu. Out me way.
  - character: THOG
    dialogue: Where go beautiful man?  Me want snu-snu!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Kif! Jump!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: My hero!
  - character: THOG
    dialogue: (shouting) Me not get snu-snu! Get him!
  - character: THOG
    dialogue: Mighty Femputer. Small girl steal green kissy man. We kill her now?
  - character: FEMBOT
    dialogue: (from inside) Come back later. Leave me alone.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (from inside) Yeah, get lost!  (spookily) Ooh! I'm a scary Femputer.
      Release the prisoners!  (from inside) And bring gold. Lots of gold.
  - character: THOG
    dialogue: Gold? Why Femputer want gold?
  - character: FEMBOT
    dialogue: (from inside) You heard the man.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (from inside) C'mon! Gimmie some of that!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: And that's how I got my new shell. It looks just like the shell I threw
      out yesterday and I found it in the same dumpster, but this one had a live raccoon
      inside.  Pretty good story, eh, Hermes?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: "Stick to someone else, you windy barnacle\xAC"
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's funny how the battle of the sexes was only resolved when a Manbot
      and a Fembot realised they loved each other.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah. By the way, if she calls, I'm not here. All I know is this gold
      says that was the best mission ever!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: It sure was.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, yeah!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I had snu-snu!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: So, um, Amy, w-what do you wanna do now?

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Gentlemen, I've completed my report on the crash.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa! I'm not reading that crap. Summarise it in one word.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Sabotage.  This is a normal L-unit. Without it, space travel is but
      the fevered dream of a madman.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yep.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Of course.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Doy!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: It's an important unit.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: And this, my friends, is the L-unit I just removed from the ship.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That doesn't look like an "L" at all. Unless you count lowercase.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You know we don't!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Whoever did this was strong. This is 340 pounds of Tonka-tough steel.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hmm. It should look like this.  But instead it looks like this.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Who would do a thing like that?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Who could do a thing like that? And by "that", I mean this.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Well, gang, it looks like we have another mystery on our hands.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: I'd better make a chart of the suspects. I'll begin by drawing a line
      with my straight-edge.  Sweet lampre of Santa Fe! My edge has been bent!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: (crying) My javelin too! It's ruined. Now we'll never beat Jupiter State.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: My slinky!  My cuddly, little pet slinky!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: What's all the hubbub?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: My God! Even the Professor's been bent.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That you for your sympathy, talking square of linoleum.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'll get you fixed up.  That's fine.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Wait a minute. Bender? What did you just do to the Professor?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I bent him.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Aha!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Bender!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: J'accuse!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, I see. A bunch of stuff gets bent so it must be the robot designed
      for bending.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: 'I know how to settle this: We''ll check last night''s surveillance
      tapes.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Huh?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: What tapes?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Surveillance?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: You've seen me naked?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Ah. Last night's tape. It was right next to Bathroom Bloopers 4.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: See? Nothing. Told you, losers.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait! There on the screen. It's that guy you are.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm sleepwalking.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Dear God! We've got robots on the ceiling.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You weren't sleepwalking. You were sleep-bending!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: This is quite a shock. On the other hand, it's not surprising in the
      least. After all, I've been bending since the day I was built.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (voice-over) I was born on an assembly line in the bad part of Tijuana.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Mama.  Hooray! I graduated! Time to bend around Europe for a few months,
      then get a job bending.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You remember your own birth?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Sure. It was only four years ago.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You're only four years old?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Precocious little scamp, ain't I?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hmm. Bender must have a pent-up need to bend that's not being satisfied
      by his bend-free lifestyle.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Then he can't stay here. He's a menace to every straight person in the
      company. Go satisfy your bend lust and don't you come back to work until you
      do.
  - character: ROBOTS
    dialogue: (chanting) No more bending, no more work. Give us a raise, you big fat
      jerk.
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: (shouting) Nevers!
  - character: JOEY
    dialogue: Yo! The Mafia supports you. But don't tell no one. Spread the word.
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: As the duly-elected mobsters of this union, it's our duty to support
      the struggle of these proud, lazy slobs.
  - character: JOEY
    dialogue: Yeah, but what if management remains intragnizent?
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: From the context it is clear what you mean. In that case, Clamps may
      have a little surprise for them.
  - character: CLAMPS
    dialogue: The clamps!  (unsure) Right?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aw, no! A strike? Now I'll never get to bend anything. Oh, woe is Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What?!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ten-times normal wage?  I'll give those jerks what for!
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: Welcomes aboard, scab.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Great to be here.
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: Come on. I'll introduces you to your scab co-workers you'll be scabbing
      with. This heres our scab foreman.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Flexo?
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Bender?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, sorry you got sent to that South American Turkish prison instead
      of me on account of mistaken identity.
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: You bastard! They treated me like an animal and that's what I became!  Nah,
      you're alright. Good to see you, buddy!
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: 'And heres another scab what also works here: Angleyne.'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (sexfully) Hello.
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: Hey, yous guyses wanna move that things?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (more sexfully) Hello!
  - character: ROBOTS
    dialogue: (chanting) Give us a raise you big fat jerk.
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: (from outside) Nevers!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ow!  Um. Hi, Angleyne. Whatcha up to?
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Making hangers. Guidance counsellor said I had a knack for it.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's cool, that's cool. So, um, uh, I was wondering if, y'know, it's
      cool if not, but, what are you doing after work?
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: What I always do. Jack squat.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Me too.  Man, we have a lot in common, huh?
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Well we are made of virtually identical components.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (sexfully) Are you sure? Maybe I should sneak a peek at your access
      panel.
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Hey, according to the scab handbook that's extremely inappropriate banter.
      (sexfully) And that's just the way I like it.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Haile H. Selassie!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: There, little friend. Good as new.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: What an exquisite day. That azure sky, the verdant treetops.  Those
      delightful birds with their chirp, chirp, chirp and their tweet, tweet, splat.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Professor, I've never seen you so cheerful. What the hell's wrong with
      you?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Hmm. I'm not quite sure. Perhaps seeing things from a new perspective
      has reminded me of life's beauty. Or perhaps my new posture is causing blood
      to pool in the back of my brain, resulting in a mild delirium. Incidentally,
      you have a dime up your nose.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I wish! It's a nickel.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Union forever! Lousy scabs! They can't do those things! Et cetera!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I bet watching me bend girders like this turns your legs all rubbery.
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Well my legs are made of rubber.  And anyway, I am just as strong as
      you are, Mac.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, yeah?  Prove it.  Here, let me help you.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: My new bent outlook has completely re-energised me. I'm even dating
      a young Brazilian retired actress.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Alright!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Some say I'm robbing the cradle but I say she's robbing the grave.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Howdy, doodies. What's new?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I was just regaling your former co-workers with a tale of bedroom antics,
      the likes of which--
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, yeah! Big whoop! No-one cares. I got Bender-related news. I'm
      in love and I'm taking all my friends out to celebrate.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Let's get liquored up!
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Hey, look at this crowd. You guys gotta try the pasta. It's got a real
      nice profit margin. Bam! So, special occasion tonight?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, Elzar, you'll never guess what's happened?
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Bam?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I met the most dynamite ladybot.
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Hey, that's terrific. To celebrate, I'm gonna stick seven copies of
      my latest cookbook on your bill.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Bless you, sir.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: So, Bender, tell us about this new girlfriend of yours.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I intend to. Through the lost art of the toast.  To Angleyne, she's
      got it all. Looks, charm and the love of a fabulous bending robot.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: She sure does.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Flexo!
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: (shouting) Careful, that's a week old!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I finally meet a nice girl with a pair of legs that don't quit unexpectedly
      and that jerk Flexo steals her away? It's time to kick some shiny, metal ass.  You
      degenerate hussy! I'm disappointed in you too, Angleyne.
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Bender, it's-it's not what you think.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, God! Then it's worse than I think.
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Now look, there is no reason to be upset. Flexo and I are divorced.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Div-- Huh?
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: We're just havin' dinner 'cause we wanna stay friends.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, I knew that. What I'm actually outraged by is your choice of wine.
      Really, it's the steward's fault.
  - character: STEWARD
    dialogue: Excellent choice, sir.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (muttering) That Flexo, I'm knockin' him right on his butt. I can't
      believe this.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Obsessing won't help, Bender. Take a lean back and enjoy life.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I can't. My Fembot may be in love with another Manbot.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well talk to her. Tell her about your feelings in an open an honest
      way.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah. Either that or be a man.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'OK, I''ve constructed an elaborate lie: I''ll call Angleyne while pretending
      to be Flexo, arrange a date, show up disguised as him and catch her two-timing
      me with myself.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's thinkin' like a man.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (disguised voice) Hello? This is Flexo.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Now we'll see who loves whom.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, hot stuff.
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Hey, Flexo.  So since when do you go to bars on work nights? It's not
      like you at all.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'Nonsense. It''s exactly like me. Flexo: The fun loving love machine
      Fembots love to love. Hey, barkeep, I''ll have a Fuzzy Navel and she''ll have
      the girliest drink in the house.'
  - character: BARTENDERBOT
    dialogue: Two Fuzzy Navel's comin' up.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I hope they can make change for a fortune.
  - character: JOEY
    dialogue: Yo. Get an eyeload of that filty scab with the beard flashing his filthy
      scab money. It's an insult to you, boss.
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: Yeah. That cash oughta be slushin' my fund and kicksing my back.
  - character: CLAMPS
    dialogue: I'm greasing up my whoozits!
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: Whoa, whoa, Clamps, not yet. Let's just keep an eye on him and see if
      he does it a couple more times.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You're lookin' good to Flexo tonight.
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Quit makin' with the googly eyes. You know that I'm in love with Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Bender? That walking wuss factory?
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Well he may be a walking factory but believe me he is no wuss. Now look.
      You and me are through. I told you that when I divorced you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But going through a divorce together, you can't tell me that didn't
      bring us closer. Care to dance?
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: You know I love dancing but you always hated it.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: In that case it's something I've always wanted to make up to you.  Hey,
      scratchmo. How 'bout dropping me and the lady some rump-rattling beats?
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: I had hoped that by the second time he flashed his cash my rage would
      have subsided. Sadly that has not happened.
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: You used to be so inflexible, Flexo. You have really loosened up!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I recently upgraded my funk card. C'mon!
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Alright!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: C'mon now, what's new!  Ew!
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Flexo? What-What's going on?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Um...
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Flexo!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'So the moral of the story is: If you want it to stay sunk, tie a weight
      to it!'
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: (laughing) You always were a kick in the teeth, man.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aw, shucks, thunder-buns! You make me feel like a million volts.
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Flexo, Flexo, Flexo. I'm starting to remember why I fell for you in
      the first place.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (thinking) So, she's falling for Flexo, eh? I'd better seduce her a
      little more, just to be sure.
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Well, it's late. I should get home to my trailer.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'll walk you out. After all, a true gentleman tends to his date's every
      need.  Tiparillo?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Here you are, my lad. Bring the lady's car around in the finest way
      possible.
  - character: JOEY
    dialogue: He's flashin' his cash loaf again.
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: How many times is that? Two or three?
  - character: CLAMPS
    dialogue: Three.
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: Alright. That's the necessary number of times. That scab's gonna have
      a little on-the-job accident.
  - character: JOEY
    dialogue: With all due respect, Donbot, I don't think we should rely on an accident
      happening. Let's kill him ourselves.
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Well, goodnight. I-I had a great time.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: How 'bout a lift? To your place.
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: What?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Admit it. You felt something for me tonight. And by me I mean Flexo.
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Hey look, I had fun but--
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But?
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: But--
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Buuut?
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: (gasping) But...  Huh? Bender! You tricked me.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's right, baby. I ain't your lover boy, Flexo, the guy you love
      so much. You even love anybody pretending to be him.
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Well maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you're pretending
      to be.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There''s only one
      reasonable course of action now: Kill Flexo.  Ow!'
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: (screaming) Nooo!
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Thanks, I appreciate that.  Nah, I'm joshing you. That was quite annoying.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You call yourself divorced? You're making a mockery of one of our oldest
      institutions.
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: What?
  - character: CLAMPS
    dialogue: Alright, boss, give the word and I'll drop this unbendable girder. Clamp,
      clamp, ka-bamp!
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: Remember, only kill the one with the beard. That other filthy scab we
      got nothing against.
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: That's low!
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Please stop! I'm not worth it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Probably not. But I love you And I'm gonna kick his ass 'til I win you
      back.
  - character: DONBOT
    dialogue: (from control room) OK, Clamps. Now!
  - character: CLAMPS
    dialogue: Ooh, that's gotta clamp!
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: Flexo? Are you OK?
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Yeah, never better.  Nah, I'm yankin' your chain, I'm dying.
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: You can't die. Tonight Bender showed me that I love you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But, I love you.
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: I know and I care for you too. But I could never love anyone as much
      as you made me realise I love Flexo.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But ... but ...  I love you so much, Angleyne, I want you to be happy
      no matter what.
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: What, what are you saying?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm saying I've got an unbendable girder to bend.
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: You can't bend that girder. It's unbendable!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well I don't know anything about lifting, so that just leaves us the
      one option.
  - character: FLEXO
    dialogue: Thanks, buddy. Another year under that and I'd have been a goner.
  - character: ANGLEYNE
    dialogue: I'll always remember this, Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) Me too. Me too. (talking) Jerk.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So Flexo and Angleyne had sex right there on the factory floor? Well,
      at least you got bending out of your system.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes. I won't be up to bending again for a long, long time.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Perhaps it's your outlook that needs a good bend. A 90-degree bend to
      a place where happiness is perpendicular to wonderment.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Professor, we're all sick of your upbeat attitude.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I'll say.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Believe it.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: 'Nonsense. It''s just like in the song I wrote:'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, you've gotta help us.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I try to get out but they keep pulling me back in.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (singing) You gotta dangle, Have a new angle, Wangle a new dangle on
      life.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: No, Bender! The other way.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I like him better this way.
  - character: FARNSWORTH

      One sheep, two sheep......three sheep.

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Maybe they're right. Maybe Nibbler is dumb.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Don't listen to them, Leela. People said I was dumb, but I proved them.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good news, everyone. We were supposed to make a delivery to the planet
      Tweenis 12 but it's been completely destroyed.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Why is that good news?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: They paid in advance.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Excuse me.
  - character: HERMES

      then Don Martin 3 went caflooie and now Tweenis 12.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Looks like this planet is next in line.
  - character: LEELA

    dialogue: What now?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) No! Nibbler, come back!

      ham by myself.  Nibbler?  Nibbler, you're scaring me.  Nibbler?!  Am I going
      crazy? Have my years of wild hedonism finally caught up with me?  Nibbler, help!
      Don't leave me here.  Uh, Nibbler? Could you scooch the seat up just a little
      bit?

      you are flying an adorable spaceship. If only you could talk.  Wait! I understood
      that!  You say you're transmitting your thoughts directly to my brain.  You
      say those awful flying brains are making everyone on Earth stupid?  Oh, stupider.
      And you go on to say that we're headed for your home planet where your race
      has lived since the beginning of the universe?  So, how did the universe begin?  Then
      the meaning of existence...? So every religion is wrong!

      bagel.
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: Thank you. I bear many receipts for reimbursement.
  - character: FIONA
    dialogue: The four welcomes of friendship to you as well, Leela. We shall manipulate
      your mind so we appear to be speaking your language. Do not be afraid, my child.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm not afraid.
  - character: FIONA
    dialogue: Uh, good. Good.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So, your real name is Lord Nibbler? That's a coincidence.
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: That name is for your sake. In the time it would take to pronounce one
      letter of my true name a trillion cosmoses would flair into existence and sink
      into eternal night.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, you're all so cute!
  - character: KEN
    dialogue: No, we are not.  We Nibblonians are an ancient and powerful race. Behold.
      When the universe was forged in the crucible of the big bang, our mighty race
      was already 17 years old.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Aww!
  - character: KEN
    dialogue: 'For the first millisecond of time, things were OK. But then there arose
      a terrible enemy: The Brain Spawn.  Ever since, we have waged unceasing war
      against these dreadful --'
  - character: KEN
    dialogue: Then let the feast of a thousand hams begin.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So why are these Brain Spawn attacking Earth, Nibbler?
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: The Brain Spawn hate all consciousness. The thoughts of others screech
      at them like the forced laughs of a billion art house movie patrons.
  - character: KEN
    dialogue: Thus, they travel from world to world making everyone stupid in order
      to wipe out all thought in the universe.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wipe out all thought? My God! They're like flying televisions.
  - character: FIONA
    dialogue: And even we are powerless to stop them, fearsome though we are.
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: There is but one being that can resist them. A child of destiny whose
      bizzare brain wave pattern makes him immune to the Brain Spawn attack.  He is
      the hope of the universe.  The fate of your world - perhaps all worlds - rests
      in his special mind.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Now, when you say "special"...
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Attention New New Yorkers. Stop acting so stupid!
  - character: KEN
    dialogue: Nibblonian fleet holding at perimeter of moron zone, formerly known
      as "Earth".
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Why would Fry be immune to the flying brains? Because he doesn't shower?
  - character: FIONA
    dialogue: The Brain Spawn suppress intelligence by attacking the delta brain wave.
      Every animal and robot in the universe generates this wave, as do certain trees.
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: Fry, however, does not.
  - character: FIONA
    dialogue: Somehow he has cobbled together a random assortment of other brainwaves
      into a working mind.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Like a prom dress made from carpet remnants.
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: Yes, like your prom dress.
  - character: KEN
    dialogue: The Brain Spawn are commanded by a giant evil brain with a gooey centre
      of pure hate.
  - character: FIONA
    dialogue: Only Fry, with is superior, yet inferior mind, can approach him. You
      must tell him to disable it. We will do the rest.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You can count on me.
  - character: FIONA
    dialogue: No we can't. Once on Earth, you will be too stupid to remember the message.
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: That's why we wrote it down for you.
  - character: KEN
    dialogue: We've also prepared a bag lunch and some mittens.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Time to re-educate you duncebags. We'll start with US presidents.  This
      is our first president, George Washington. Let's review. Who was our first president?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Umm...
  - character: BENDER

    dialogue: Even bigger than those? Holy nuts! Where is it?
  - character: LEELA

    dialogue: Hm. A giant brain is basically a giant nerd. And where would a giant
      nerd be? The libary!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm here to kick your ass.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's right. And I think you'll find that a little knowledge is a dangerous
      thing!  OK, better think of a new plan. Come on, Fry, think!  Thinking...thinking...
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can think of a way to use that.  Aha!
      Prepare to be thought at. Leela, give me a topic.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Duh...
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Seriously, I can't think of anything. Gotta find something to make me
      think. (reading) Hardy Boys. (talking) Too easy. (reading) Nancy Drew. (talking)
      Too hard. Aha! Perfect! Bonfire of the Vanities!

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'Leela cried for her lost love as Fry lay dead under the heavy bookcase.
      The Big Brain laughed in triumph......Then, for no reason, he left Earth forever.
      The end.  There!  Now he''s trapped in a book I wrote: A crummy world of plot
      holes and spelling errors.'

  - character: NIBBLER

      Earth had no memory of what had transpired, except Fry. And no one believed
      him or cared what he had to say...
  - character: NIBBLER

  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: My whole life I worked on that act. And they hated it.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: You're a crazy, penniless, lobster doctor. No combination of you should
      be a comedian.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: But comedy is in my valves. My Uncle Harold was a big Hollywood star
      back in the era of silent holograms.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (awestruck) Your uncle was Harold Zoid?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (dramatic) This I cannot deny.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Why, I've been a Harold Zoid fan since back when my hips were made of
      bone. As it happens, I still have some of my original 78s.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: You're right, crabby. He's a hell of a lot funnier than you could ever
      be.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Maybe so, but perhaps if I wrote him and asked for a few hundred pointers...
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: This letter has to be very personal, so I'm writing it in my own ink.  (writing;
      thinking) Dear Uncle Zoid, Greetings from your long-lost nephew. Norm and Sam
      and Sadie's boy, remember? ...
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (voice-over) ...Now I am the most important doctor at the delivery company
      where I work. But, sadly, my life is bereft of laughter.
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: (reading) I beg of you, Mr. Funny Uncle, teach me the comedy business.
      Sincerely, Zoidberg. (talking) Oy, isn't that nice? He took the time.
  - character: WOMAN
    dialogue: What's that scribbldy-gook?
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: This is a fan letter from my rich doctor nephew who just might be my
      ticket out of this flophouse, he might.  Yeah, you'd better run.  (writing)
      Dear Rich Doctor Nephew, I can help you be funny. The first funny thing you
      must do is put all of your money in the form of a cashier's cheque and come
      to Hollywood.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (reading) Sincerely, Harold Zoid. P.S. Cashier's cheque. (talking) Did
      you hear that? I'm going to Hollywood!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Neat!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, I am, me!  Bender is!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes, I will.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Are you my new hot water heater?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No, I'm Bender. We met once, remember?
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Absolutely not.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Come on, don't you remember how much I was bugging you, don't you? 'Cause
      it was a lot, you remember, right?
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Look, I'm programmed to be very busy. Unless you can heat water to 212
      degrees, I'm not interested.  Have you got an extra GOTO 10 line? I said I don't
      need a bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Bender? That was the other guy. My name's Boiler.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Nice work, Boiler.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Thanks. And call me Bender.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: That's where I'm meeting Uncle Zoid for lunch to discuss my Hollywood
      dreams. Next time you see me, don't be surprised if I've eaten.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Uncle Zoid, you're looking young enough to be throw back!
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: 'Rich nephew, come over here and give your uncle a nice, big meal.  So,
      here we are: A still-famous film comedian...'
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: '...And a rich, respected doctor with many surviving patients.'
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: Eating real food in a restaurant, as we both often do. So, you want
      to be a comedian, is it?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: It's my lifelong dream.
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: (shouting) Well that dream dies now. You're unfunny and untalented.
      That's why you're perfect for drama.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Hmm, serious drama. Perhaps it is time to give up comedy.
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: I'm putting together a big drama picture right now, as we speak. The
      script is dynamite. I know because I wrote it myself. And with me directing
      and starring, I'll be back on top after 50 miserable years......uh, of fame.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Ah, fame. Where do I come in?
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: This fame film has a juicy part for you, if you completely finance it
      with your doctor money. So, are you in?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Uh, OK. How much do I have to invest?
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: Oh, not much, not much, (quietly) amilliondollars. (talking) Then it's
      settled. Another blockbuster Hollywood deal.

  - character: ZOIDBERG

  - character: WAITER

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What's with Monstro?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: He promised he'd give his Uncle Zoid a million bucks to make a movie.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (crying) I've only been here a day and already I'm a Hollywood phoney.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (proud) Well, perhaps I could call on TVs Calculon to help, now that
      I'm in showbiz.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Since when have you been in the biz?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Long enough, little man. Long enough.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Calculon, as your hot water heater......I would be remiss if I didn't
      bring you scripts that could make you an international film star.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Of course. Tell me about the project.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: It's a movie.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Interesting. Tell me more.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'Get this: For a scant $1 million investment, you can be the star.'
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: And?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And, uh, I guarantee it'll win you an Oscar.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: An Oscar, you say? That would get me out of this festering rat's nest
      called "television" once and for all. Let me see the script.  No, no I don't
      like the font.  Wait! Harold Zoid? Was this written by the Harold Zoid?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Written and Xeroxed.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Good heavens. A chance to work with the legendary Harold Zoid. He's
      one of my great idols. And, and you say you can guarantee me the Oscar?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I can guarantee anything you want.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Then I'll do it!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Hooray!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Here's your chequebook.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our director, the legendary Harold
      Zoid!
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: 'Thank you. A more classic movie plot there isn''t: A son who does not
      want to follow in his father''s business. And that business is being president
      of Earth, no less. The son, as it happens, is vice president.'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (to Calculon) That plot makes perfect sense, wink wink.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Bender, you said "wink wink" out loud.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No, I didn't. (quietly) Raise middle finger.
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: Now, remember, and I can't stress this enough, this is a talkie. So
      I want the full gamut of emotions from every actor in every scene.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: The Magnificent Three. Scene one, take one.
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: And, action!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Take back your gilded pen, Father. Signing bills into law was always
      your dream, not mine.
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: 'Cut! Cut! Cut it!  I said this is a talkie, damnit! You''ve got to
      emote more! And you extras: Wave your arms and make faces. What is this, a morgue?'
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: The Magnificent Three. Scene 10, take 95.
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: Action. And I mean circus-grade action.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Sir, I call upon you not as a president but as a father.
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: Cut, cut, cut it!  Would you show a little emotion?  People, people,
      please. Just because it's a dramatic scene, doesn't mean you can't do a little
      comedy in the background.  Throw a pie or two, for God's sake.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: (screaming) Nooo!
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: Cut, cut it! Eck! Look, look, it's alright, kid. We'll, uh, we'll get
      it in editing. Alright, that's a wrap everybody, I'm gonna see you all at the
      premiere which, by the way, when is?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Well, uh, editing is a long and expensive process but we spent all the
      money on pies, so it'll be ready Friday.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Nice turnout, Calculon. That Oscar's practically on your mantel.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: I just pray they like me half as much as I do.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: (in movie) I agreed to be your vice president but I never agreed to
      be your son.  Thank you, Lieutenant Smith.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (in movie) Good morning, Mr. Vice President!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela, we're missing the premiere. My only goal in life was to attend
      a Hollywood shindig. Just pay the valet the two bucks.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No! It's the principle of the thing. Besides, I think I see a parking
      lot up ahead.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: (in movie) Father, I have asked you to join me on the White House roof
      so we could have a heart-to-heart talk. I will never follow in your footsteps.
      Here is my resignation as vice president.
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: (in movie) No! My son will not shame me like this. I would sooner die,
      I would!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: (in movie) Father! The ledge!
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: (in movie) Oy!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: (in movie) Oh.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (in movie) The president is dead. Congratulations, Mr. President.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: (screaming; in movie) Nooo!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (cheering) Woohoo! Yeah! He's a visionary!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Everyone walked out. They hated it. I've seen plagues that have better
      opening nights than this. You said that Oscar was practically on my mantel.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Now you know why I use the qualifier, "practically".
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: You listen to me. I'm out a million bucks here! You get me that Oscar,
      or you're dead! You and these snivelling lobsters! Dead. You hear me? Dead!
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: Oy, now he emotes!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: 400 categories and not a single nomination for me.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: But you won this Golden Globe!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Piffle! That's the Emmy of movie awards! I told you I want an Oscar.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Then maybe you should act better.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: The Oscar isn't about acting. It's about earning the respect and admiration
      of the creative community.
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: How 'bout we rig the awards?
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: That's fine too.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's no use. The tar is too thick. Plus, I think I flooded it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, we missed the premiere and we're gonna die. We might as well enjoy
      the sights.  Oh my God, Sylvester Stallone!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: This is where you live? I though you were a big-shot Hollywood movie
      star.
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: No, I'm not. I'm an even bigger liar than you. My career went down the
      tube the day they invented smell-a-vision.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Calculon's gonna kill us for sure. It's all everybody else's fault.
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: Oy. All I wanted was for people to think of me one last time before
      I die.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: What are you talking about? Everybody remembers Harold Zoid!
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: As a pathetic has-been, they remember me. As a forgotten relic, they
      remember me. Bah! It's better to die now.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: No. This is one death Dr. Zoidberg won't be responsible for. Zoidberg
      away!
  - character: RIVERS
    dialogue: Hi, I'm Joan Rivers's head. I tell you, I've had so many face-lifts,
      they finally lifted it right off my body! It's true, it's true! Oh, oh, oh,
      here comes Jack Nicholson's DNA, reconstituted in a gorilla body.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Catering.
  - character: RIVERS
    dialogue: Oh, and here's washed-up actor, what's-his-name, Harold Zoid. Are you
      presenting one of those tacky honorary awards, or just getting one?
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: I'm a seat-filler, Joan's head. My only marketable skill is to occupy
      space.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: You know, the second I don't win that award, you're cat food. Right,
      Boxy?
  - character: ANNOUNCER
    dialogue: And now, the host of the 1074th Academy Awards, Billy Crystal.
  - character: CRYSTAL
    dialogue: Now I know how a Pez dispenser feels. Alright, we're already one hour
      behind. Our first award tonight, Best Cinematography in a Non-Visible Spectrum.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's been two weeks. You wanna play tic-tac-toe again before we eat
      our shoes?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, I always knew I'd die at the bottom of a pit. But a pit full of
      tar?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What was that? A tar dolphin or a tar shark?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's some kind of hollow tube, devoid of human life.  The Los Angeles
      subway! We can blast our way in and escape!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Alright, but I still feel like having a shoe.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: What category are they on?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: They're giving out the minor technical awards. I think they're up to
      writing.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: That leave Best Soft-Drink Product Placement and then Best Actor. We
      don't have much time.
  - character: CRYSTAL
    dialogue: 'And the nominees for Best Soft-Drink Product Placement are:'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And now, to present the award for Best Actor......a bit player in the
      flop movie The Magnificent Three......Dr. Zoidberg.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: (quietly) OK, Boxy, keep your prong on the trigger.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: 'And the nominees for Best Actor are: Sir Lawrence...... in The Merchant
      Of Venus, Hive Mind Gamma 7X in Bikini Party Summer, the Soda Machine Robot
      in Bikini Party Summer, Mark Jones in How Beige Was My Jacket and, instead of
      the fifth guy - Calculon, for his powerhouse performance in The Magnificent
      Three.'
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: Hooray, I won't be murdered. I'll live another day. Another day of...pathetic,
      forgotten misery.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: And the winner is... And the winner, instead of any of the nominees,
      is the legendary Harold Zoid!
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: Thank you. Thank you so much! You know, through all my ups and downs,
      I always thought the most important thing in life was to win an Oscar. But tonight
      I realise what's really important is to win two Oscars. Ha, ha! I'm kidding,
      I'm kidding. What really matters in life is that people care about you, whether
      it's a whole crowd......or just one die-hard fan.
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: Thank you, nephew.  Now I can die happy. 10 seconds from now, when Calculon
      kills us.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Harold Zoid!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hit the deck!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Where's that Oscar?
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: Here, enjoy. What are you getting upset? It's slightly less fraudulent
      for you to have it.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Yes, yes it's a real beauty. Someday I hope to win one of my own.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Then you're not going to kill us, Your Majesty?
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Nay. I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death
      with his own Oscar.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Earthquake!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hit the deck!
  - character: ZOID
    dialogue: Let the earth quake, I've got somebody's Oscar!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We made it! I'm at a Hollywood party!
  - character: DOORMAN
    dialogue: I'm sorry, sir, this is a private - oh, pardon me, I see you're with

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Controversial?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh my no.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: For this highly controversial mission, you'll be towing the Juan Valdez,
      an orbitting supertanker full of rich Columbian dark matter.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Dark matter oil? What if we hit something? The tanker could leak!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Impossible!  The tanker has 6000 hulls. So, unlike me, it's entirely
      leak-proof! Now, once you've hauled the tanker past the protestors -
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Protestors?

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This time it's your reckless disregard for the environment. In fact,
      I'm gonna go join those protestors.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: This is an outrage. I demand that you hand over your captain's jacket.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This is my normal jacket. I've had it for 10 years.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I said hand it over!  Well Fry, or should I say Captain Fry?  No I shouldn't.
      Because Bender is the new captain!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That's right. Being a captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain
      can't have either one. That's why cold, logical Bender is perfect for the job.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, I do think of human life as expendable.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No fair. Leela was training me to be captain. She even let me sit in
      her lap and steer - in this comic I drew.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Ooo, the new one's out!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fry, the title of captain may inflate the human ego, but it's beneath
      the notice of my mighty robo-logic!  Now look spry men! We launch at six bells!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Why do we have to resort to non-violence? Can't we just kick their asses?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aye! We're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones' U-Haul! At ease men!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I am at ease.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Mr Fry. I like to give my first mate an informal nickname. From now
      on, you will be known as...Wiggles!
  - character: WIGGLES
    dialogue: The hell I will! Have you even read the captain's handbook?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I have now. And what's Peter Parrot's first rule of captaining?
  - character: WIGGLES
    dialogue: Always respect the chain-o-command - captain.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Correct Wiggles. You've just earned an invitation to the captain's table.

      your gallant captain?

      some other planet?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Dammit Fry! He may have done wrong, but he's still your captain.

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: He didn't?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No. And with windchill it's 20 degrees below absolute zero. I'd better
      go find him.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait. Let me. Bender and I have our disagreements, but we're still friends
      and I'm gonna show him what that means. To the ship.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Why don't you just walk? He was only about 20 yards from here.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Madam, I am in command now.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Such a man. I'd follow him to hell and back I would.

    dialogue: (in penguin) Not entirely.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Captain, I don't think we're on Pluto any longer. In fact, we may have

      breeding?

  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (shouting; from ship) It's been an honour to serve under you sir!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Alright, this is for their own good. Don't leave orphans. Gotta kill
      entire families.  But they're so cute. No! You can do this. It's just like murdering
      a little butler. I...I can't look. (crying) Oh no! What have I done?  Oh you
      poor little guy! I'm so sorry I - Bender?  What's going on? Were you hiding
      out with these little guys?

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Stop! Stop shooting! It's me, Leela.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Not this way.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look, I don't know if shooting penguins will help the environment or
      not. But I do know that the decision shouldn't be in the hands of people who
      just wanna kill for fun.

    dialogue: No!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Attack!
  - character: BENDER

      the glaciers!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: They used to be such peaceful birds. I suppose this was your doing.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yep. It's like I taught 'em. If it ain't black and white - peck scratch
      and bite! Now to take off my tuxedo.  Guys, it's me! Your lovable dictator!
      Uh-oh!

    dialogue: So Leela, were you able to help the penguins?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well sure. I mean...not really...I mean...nature will work itself out.
      It can't screw things up any worse than we did trying to fix things right?

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, stop! It's a baby!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: A baby what?  Ow!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, it's just a card -- from the orphanarium I grew up in.
  - character: CARD
    dialogue: Leela, you're invited to reunion at Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium.
      Please stand clear of self-destructing basket.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: A reunion at your old orphanarium, eh? You gonna go?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No way, jose-bot. I never wanna see those other orphans again! Not after
      the way they used to pick on me.
  - character: KIDS
    dialogue: (chanting) One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!
  - character: KIRK
    dialogue: Nice depth-perception, one-eye!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: How can you make fun of me, Kirk? You're blind!
  - character: KIRK
    dialogue: My eyes may not work, but at least I got two of them!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aww. That's terrible, Leela. But imagine the look on their faces when
      you show up with two friends who eat all the hors d'oeuvres.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, I wouldn't mind rubbing my success in a few choice faces.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Set a course for adventure!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Eww!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What a dump!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Just like old times. Gosh. The bars on the windows seemed so much thicker
      back then.  Mr. Vogel? Remember me?
  - character: VOGEL
    dialogue: Leela! You're worthless and no one will ever love you!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You used to say that all the time!
  - character: VOGEL
    dialogue: Oh, those were happier days.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Mmm! The gristle-in-a-blanket isn't half bad.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Mmm! And try one of these Popsicle sticks. They've absorbed quite a
      bit of flavour.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey, look. It's our old group picture.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't see you anywhere.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's me over in Cootietown.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa! Get a load of this average-looking guy!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's Adlai Atkins. I used to have kind of a crush on him.
  - character: KIDS
    dialogue: (chanting) One-eye! One-eye!
  - character: KIDS
    dialogue: (chanting) One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!
      One-eye!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, it's time to say hello to the old gang.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: And what am I up to, you ask? Well I'm a very successful space captain.
  - character: WOMAN
    dialogue: (patronising) That's so good for a person with one eye.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey! You can't feel sorry for me! I'm a space captain and you're all
      a bunch of losers.
  - character: KIRK
    dialogue: Well, if it isn't old one-eye!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, yeah? Well, shut up, cane boy!
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: Leave Leela alone. She's leading a perfectly normal life. She's not
      gussied up, duded out, getting down or where it's at. Now, run along.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thanks, Adlai. I guess you never really outgrow being an eyeball --
      oddball!
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: Nonsense. You're a space captain. That's a fine, conventional profession.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, you know. It's just for a package delivery service.
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: Ah-ah. A package is just a box until it's delivered.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Huh. I'd never thought of it that way. So what do you do these days?
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: Oh, I'm a doctor.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: A tall doctor, you say?
  - character: VOGEL
    dialogue: Sir, you seem pretty stable. Have you thought about adopting one of
      our kids?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sure haven't.
  - character: VOGEL
    dialogue: Well keep adoption in mind. It's a great way to have kids without having
      sex.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (thoughtful) Really?
  - character: VOGEL
    dialogue: Plus, the government will help out with a small stipend of $100 a week.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: $100 a week?
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: I'm so sorry I teased you back then. Let me make it up to you. I can
      fix it so that no one ever makes fun of you again.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You mean by beating them up? Because I've broken that blind kid's nose
      like 10 times and it doesn't make any difference.
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: No, I specialise in phaser eye surgery. I can build you a paraffin eye
      and graft it on with skin from your foot. It won't be able to see but you'll
      look like a perfectly normal two-eyed person.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Me? Perfectly normal?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, why are those kids following you? Do you have candy stuck to your
      ass?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No. It's called parenting. Come on, dumplings. We've got 12 government
      stipends to collect.
  - character: KIDS
    dialogue: (cheering) Yay!
  - character: BOY
    dialogue: Our daddy's a giant toy!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Phaser eye surgery is a capital idea. I'm sure Leela's tired of morons
      gaping at her eye all the time.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I think cosmetic surgery's great, Leela. I used to be too cute, so I
      had cuteness-reduction surgery here......and here.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You guys are crazy. Leela doesn't need surgery. You look great the way
      you are.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, that's so sweet, Fry. But for once in my life, I just wanna look
      normal.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But you're better than normal, you're abnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn't
      care what other people think.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You're right! I'll start by not caring what you think!  I'm getting
      the surgery.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Thatagirl!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Right on!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Wonderful. And while you're under the knife, you could also get an ink
      pouch to help you escape your enemies.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard you imbecile!
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: Now we'll find out if the operation was a success. Hold on to your hats.
      Oh, I'm sorry, this is the wrong patient. Oops.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Leela, those eyes look so great on you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bah! I think she looked fine before.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Uh-uh.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Wrong.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wow, look at me. Although I don't have the hang of blinking yet.
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: You'll get it. Personally, I try not to blink too much because it seems
      flashy. But when I do, I enjoy it.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I did it! I blunk!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: And just in time to screw up this picture I took!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hooray!
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: IGNER
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: LARRY
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I've never felt so unremarkable! Today I actually blended in with a
      crowd!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Kids, meet the jerkbags I work with.
  - character: KIDS
    dialogue: (chanting) Hello, jerkbags!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh, they're so cute! What are their names?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Kids have names?
  - character: NINA
    dialogue: My name's Nina, and his name's Albert --
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And from now on, you're all named Bender Jr.!  Looky here! My first
      government stipend cheque! 12 baby humans, 1200 wing-wangs!
  - character: SALLY
    dialogue: Daddy Bender, we're hungry.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What is it with you kids? Every other day, it's food, food, food!  Oh,
      fine. I'll get you some stupid food.
  - character: ALBERT
    dialogue: Can we have Bender burgers again?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No. The cat shelter's on to me!
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: Hello, Leela. I was in a nearby tailor getting one of my Hawaiian shirts
      toned down, so I thought I'd drop in for your follow-up exam.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's so handsome of you.
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: Just follow the light with your eyes. Perfect! You know, a guy could
      fall head-over-heels for a gal like you. As for me, I'm somewhat interested
      myself.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What are you saying?
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: I've never been good with words, which is why I'm in such a delicate
      conundrum. Will you go out with me this Sunday?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Sure!
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: I don't know what else to say, so I'll just say it. Okey-dokey, see
      you then.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This is so unfair! I liked you back when you were a cyclops! That guy's
      only interested now that you have two eyes.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You're just jealous!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, I'm not! Oh, wait, I am. But my point remains valid!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, I just wanna try dating a normal man, who if you go somewhere with
      him no one says he's crummy. I think I deserve that once in life.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Be careful with Adlai, Leela, he's a doctor, they're very poor.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Actually, most doctors are rich.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: What? When did this happen? You're joking, right?  That's not funny!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'OK, they''ve got everything you need here: Booze, a couple of peanuts,
      they got a crapper in the back -- that''s one of the things you kids do, right?'
  - character: ALBERT
    dialogue: Yeah.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Then knock yourself out.  Hey! Hey! Only eat enough to barely keep yourselves
      alive! I'm trying to make a profit here.
  - character: NINA
    dialogue: Daddy! Bethany's hitting me!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Here.
  - character: FEMBOT
    dialogue: These kids yours?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah.
  - character: FEMBOT
    dialogue: Ooh. I'm attracted to a man with responsibility!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's me, baby! Let me just ditch the kids in an alley and we can go
      have some fun.
  - character: BOY
    dialogue: Daddy Bender?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Son, daddy's trying to score with a cheap floozy right now, so we need
      you to cram a Tinkertoy in it!
  - character: BOY
    dialogue: I love you, Daddy Bender!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, what the hell are you doing? Quit hugging me!
  - character: FEMBOT
    dialogue: I guess you're busy. I'll catch you later.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You morons! I don't know what you're trying to pull here but I got half
      a mind to hug each and every one of you and see how you like it!
  - character: KIDS
    dialogue: (cheering) Yay!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (grumbling) Oh, come on!
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: I thought I'd take you someplace ordinary -- a place no one could object
      to.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That sounds wonderful.
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: I'd like and extra-beautiful bouquet for my extra-gorgeous sweetheart.
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: Average, please.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, Adlai, I've had a wonderful time today. No one's stared at me or
      avoided staring at me or tried to burn me. You make me feel so not weird.
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: Leela, you're 999,999 in a million!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thanks for coming out to get to know my boyfriend. Isn't he dreamy?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (mesmerised) Totally.
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: 'Uh, listen: I just want you all to know your Leela''s one standard
      lady.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, Adlai, stop!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'What''s so wonderful about Leela being normal? The rest of us aren''t
      normal and that''s what makes us great. Like Dr. Zoidberg: He''s a weird monster
      who smells like he eats garbage and does.'
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Damn right!
  - character: FRY

  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Sploops!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: And Fry, you've got that brain thing.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna be like us? Or do you wanna be
      like Adlai with no severe mental or social problems whatsoever?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's the dumbest question I ever heard!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: She's right!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: No doubt about it.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Duh!

      the right.
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Which one of you cutie muffins gets the children's spicy squab?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah-ah-ah! What do we say when someone gives you something?

    dialogue: That's my boy!
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: And here's your check. Bam!
  - character: ALBERT
    dialogue: I gotta go poopy!
  - character: BENDER

      C'mon! Go, go! Through the kitchen!
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: (shouting) You little crooks! If I catch you I'm going to make cutie-muffin
      gumbo!
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: You know, seeing that strange robot force 12 children to do his bidding
      makes me think about kids of our own.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Us? Me? You? Kids?
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: That's correct. It's time to stop living this vida bachelor loca, settle
      down and have kids.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, Adlai, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!
  - character: ALBERT
    dialogue: Daddy Bender, I want a piggy back ride.

      Bender was caught shoplifting!
  - character: ALBERT
    dialogue: Yeah, show us the picture!  There he is!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: OK, kids. It's 9:00, you know what that means. Daddy's sick of looking
      at you so go to bed.  The grown-ups have to talk. Come on, Ma.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Now to figure out how much money I'm raking in off those twerps!  Oh,
      I need a calculator.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You are a calculator.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I mean a good calculator. Minus the food, the bunny rabbit wallpaper
      -- I'm getting 100 bucks a kid and they're costing 110!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: There goes my new kitchen cabinets.
  - character: BENDER

    dialogue: You know, doing this jigsaw puzzle of a pacifier factory makes me want
      to have children with you all the more.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Adlai, I was thinking. Since we're both orphans, maybe we should adopt
      a child.
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: Adoption? Yes, that's acceptable. Heck, it's more than acceptable. It's
      adequately satisfactory!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hello? Imperial Dragon Restaurant? I've got a herd of you-know-whats
      for sale...Let me check.  Oh, aren't you a cutie? About 35lbs.  What?!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hi, Bender. We'd like to adopt a child.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, you've come to the right place because Honest Bender's Orphanarium
      means discount orphans. Now, little lady. What do I have to do to send you home
      with 12 orphans today?
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: Uh, I'm afraid we only want one.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whatever you say, chief. I'll show you what I got in stock.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'I remember this from when we were kids: The warden would trot you out
      in front of prospective parents and they''d judge you like a piece of meat.'
  - character: ALBERT
    dialogue: I'm Albert.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Kind of fatty.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Then how about this little number? Pure-bred human. No vampire in there.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, um.
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: Hmm.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: If you're strapped for cash, you might wanna consider this irregular
      unit. Cursed with a third ear but so full of that emotion that I understand
      is called "love".
  - character: SALLY
    dialogue: One time, I did a hundred jump ropes.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have to think about it.

  - character: ALBERT
    dialogue: But it's 10 in the morning!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I said hit the hay!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, they're all so adorable.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah. You know, it's times like this I can hardly bear to let them go.
      Goodnight, you princes of Maine, you kings of New New England.
  - character: SMITTY
    dialogue: You're under arrest for child cruelty, child endangerment, depriving
      children of food, selling children as food and misrepresenting the weight of
      livestock.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Officer, would it be alright if we adopted one of the kids?
  - character: SMITTY
    dialogue: Might as well. They're just gonna rot in the evidence locker.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her.
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: Her? But there's plenty of normal ones.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Come on, Adlai. She could really use a mom and dad.
  - character: KIDS
    dialogue: (chanting) Ear-face! Ear-face! Sally won the ugly race!
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: On the other hand, the children bring up a good point. She does have
      an ear on her face.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well? So what? She may be different but she still deserves a good home.
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: Oh, alright. If you really want that one, I can give her an operation
      to make her acceptable.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: She doesn't need an operation! She's fine the way she is!
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: Oh, and I suppose you were fine the way you were?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Damn right I was!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yay!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Shut up, Fry. Now look, Adlai. I'm proud to be different. And I just
      wished I'd realised that when I was her age.
  - character: SALLY
    dialogue: I also have a tail!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Now take me to the hospital and put my eye back the way it was. Right
      now!
  - character: ADLAI
    dialogue: Why should I do that?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Listen, buddy. By the end of the day, one of us is going to have one
      eye.
  - character: VOGEL
    dialogue: In recognition of Bender's generous gift of 12 orphans and a government
      cheque for 1200 wing-wangs, I hereby rename this building the Bender B. Rodriguez
      Orphanarium!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's good to have the old weird-looking Leela back.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Aww! You're a true friend, Fry. I guess there's nothing wrong with being
      a little weird.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything.
  - character: ALBERT
    dialogue: We'll miss you, Daddy Bender.
  - character: NINA
    dialogue: We know robots don't have emotions but we drawed you this picture!

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. Sheesh!  Hey, what the? Get
      away! Come on! I just got all the gum off of there! Hey! Hey! (shouting) I hate
      you! I hate you all!

      Still only $100.

      athlete's foot cream for my face?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: He's right! I've gotta start investing wisely.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, I'm down to my last lottery ticket. Cherry.  Cherry!  Mule. Crud!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So, you got six bucks left to retire on. I recommend Tender Vittles.
  - character: TELLER
    dialogue: You're opening a retirement account for $6? I'm sure a wealthy ...  ...
      mule farmer like yourself is aware that we charge a $10 monthly fee.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shrugging) You gotta spend money to make money.

  - character: ROBOT
    dialogue: Gee, I've seen lines move faster in a sperm bank.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's for sure--  Roberto! Is that you?
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: Bender! Hey, man!

  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: Not bad, not bad.  Everybody on the floor! This is a stick-up!

    dialogue: Cool. Ca-Can you give me a hand here?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Sure thing, pal.

  - character: WHITEY
    dialogue: 'The charge is bank robbery. Now, my caddie chauffeur informs me that
      a bank is a place where people put money that isn''t properly invested. Therefore,
      robbing a bank is tantamount to that most heinous of crimes: Theft of money!'
  - character: CAMERA
    dialogue: 'Well, let''s see. My memory''s a little fuzzy, but it went exactly
      like this:'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I sure do! That's the real robber and I'll never forget his name as
      long as I live. And that name is--
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) Fry! Just give a name. You don't wanna look stupid on Court
      TV!
  - character: FRY

    dialogue: Ah, the 67th Amendment.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: A few months in an insane asylum? I could do that standing on my head.
  - character: WHITEY
    dialogue: Counselor, what evidence do you offer to support this new plea of insanity?
  - character: WHITEY
    dialogue: Insanity plea is accepted. Mr. Bender, I hereby commit you to the asylum
      for criminally insane robots until such time as you are deemed cured.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yahoo! The system fails again!
  - character: WHITEY
    dialogue: And, Mr. Fry, I sentence you to the home for criminally insane humans.
  - character: BAILIFF
    dialogue: Your Honour, that facility has been full ever since you ruled that being
      poor is a mental illness.
  - character: WHITEY
    dialogue: Order! Order! The only poor people I want to hear about are the people
      who tend to my pores at the spa. Just send them both to the robot loony bin
      and let's go.

    dialogue: (from box) Ow! My head! Ow! My feet! Ow! My head! Ow! My feet!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Keep your chin up!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (from box) Ow! My chin!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't belong here, Bender. This is an asylum for insane robots!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, you meet half the qualifications.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, good, a physical! Once they examine my fragile, naked, pink body,
      they'll see I'm not a--
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What the--?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) I find that offensive!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look! There's been a terrible mistake. I'm a human being. See?  I'm
      all squishy and flabby. Also, I complain a lot.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I do other human stuff! I age! See?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: The car dealer? Wow! I guess his prices really were insane.
  - character: FRY

    dialogue: My roommate exploded. Oh, you gotta help me, Bender. How can I prove
      I'm human?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You could drop dead. That'd show 'em.

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Are you crazy? This place is great! Electroshock whenever you want it,
      two Lincolns for every Napoleon.  Ah! Sweet light crude!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But I'm not a robot like you. I don't like having discs crammed into
      me. Unless they're Oreos - and then only in the mouth! Don't you understand?
      I'm gonna die here!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah, quit your bellyaching and take it like a robot.
  - character: VICTOR
    dialogue: The doctor says you are making great strides with your exploding problem.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You gotta get me out of here. I would have starved to death if not for
      that sick vending machine robot.  Gimmie! Gimmie!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Poor Fry! He's got the munchies for freedom!
  - character: LEELA

      want to appear soft on people who've been falsely imprisoned.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: At least I have friends on the outside. Bender's been no help at all.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Je suis Napoleon!  No, seriously, I'm not.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Bender! You should be more ashamed of yourself than usual.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah, lighten up, honey. I'm just trying to get through a difficult time
      using humour.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) Help me! For God's sake, help me!
  - character: FARNSWORTH

      asylum. But now it's nearly over. So long.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (sleep-talking) Thirty days hath September, April, June and ... wonder
      ... is that peanut butter ... what am I gonna do? (talking) Oh, God! What? What?

    dialogue: Roberto! W-W-W-What are you doing here?
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: I got busted robbing that bank again.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Why would you hold up the same bank twice?
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: Ah, that first time was just to case the joint and rob it a little.  What's
      the matter? You scared?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: N--, n--, n--
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: Noticeably? I'll say! Now stand back, I gotta practice my stabbing.

    dialogue: No! Please! Help! Stop it! Please!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting; from cell) Hey! Keep it down in there! I'm tuning my banjo!

      Fry!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) Gonna sing a little tale about a battle called Waterloo. (talking)
      Bonjour, y'all!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Listen to me, Fry. Just because you think you're a robot, doesn't make
      you a robot. After all, I think I'm a doctor but that doesn't make me a doctor.
      These fancy clothes do!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (mechanical voice) Negative. I must be a robot. Why else would human
      women refuse to date me?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, lots of reasons.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (mechanical voice) Bio-units, terminate noise exchange. It is time for

    dialogue: Hey, Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Roberto! Ooh, what a surprise to see you in here! Especially 'cause
      I didn't squeal on you, remember? Remember all that squealing I didn't do? Remember?
      Do ya?
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: Yeah, yeah. Now lie down and play dead. And don't ham it up!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, sure.  Anything for you, buddy.
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: Wait here, Bender. I need to get a disguise.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, what's with the get-up?
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: I'm in disguise 'cause I'm thinking of escaping. You in? Or do I gotta
      kill ya so you don't squeal?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm in! I'm in!  So when were you planning the breakout?
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: I'm thinking maybe a few seconds ago.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Quick! Let's keep escaping!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Times two, carry the one ...
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, you sad, worthless human.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: What are ya--? Sacred hog of Prague! That was my anniversary gift to
      LaBarbara!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Fear not! For I shall assist ye!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Robots don't say "ye"!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Relax, mammal. My robotic software shall meet your calculatory needs.  What
      is the meaning of this symbol?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: That's a plus sign, you pointy-haired loony! Quit thinking you're a
      robot!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'll show ye!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Stand back. I'm a tool-bot.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You're not a tool-bot. You're not a food-motron. You're not a robot
      of any kind.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yes, I am. I simply haven't discovered my primary function yet.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the
      way only a woman can.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You're going to do his laundry?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (sexfully) Fry, this is for you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Beep.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, for God's sake!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: By a scallop's forelocks! What's with all the beer, Fry?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (drunk) Alcohol fuels my power cells. And as a mighty robot, I--  Beep.

    dialogue: Thanks for helping me escape, Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, it was nothing.
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: (shouting) It was not nothing! (talking) I wanna repay you. Let me get
      you something in here.
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: (shouting) Hands up! This is a stick-up again!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wow! Hitting the same place three times? I admire your style, Roberto.
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: Gimmie the remaining dough. And the calendars ... and that pen. Try
      to tear it so most of the beads are on my end!
  - character: URL
    dialogue: Police! You're busted!
  - character: SMITTY
    dialogue: And don't try anything. This glass here is laser-proof.  Fire lasers!  Duck!
      Lasers!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Come on! I got a place where I like to hide after crimes.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Aw! He looks like a little insane drunken angel.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (panting) Hey, everybody. Meet my good pal, Roberto.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Hey, mon.
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: Nice to meet you.
  - character: SMITTY
    dialogue: (on megaphone; from outside) Come out with your hands up.
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: (shouting) Hostages!
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: Back off! I got hostages!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Hooray! I'm helping!
  - character: SMITTY
    dialogue: (on megaphone) Do you have any better hostages?
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: To show them who's crazy, I'm gonna execute some of you. How 'bout you?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Ouch! That's going to bleed when my heart beats.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait! Take me first!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes! Take her first.
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: Shut up! Stop telling me how to do this!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Oh, the fear!
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: I'm thinking of a number between one and ten. Guess it and you die first.
      Go!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Um ... OK. Fixty ... six ... ish?
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: 56? 56? Oh, man! Now that's all I can think about! I'm gonna kill you,
      you ... no good ... 56-ing--
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Don't kill me yet! I'm starting to come down with Stockholm syndrome
      ... handsome!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Halt, fellow robot!
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: Hey, Red. You're just in time to join the hostage situation. Which side
      you wanna be on?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: The side that kicks your twisted, metal ass!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry! Stay back. He's too powerful.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'Negative, bossy meat creature. I know now what my primary function
      is: I am a battle-droid. Sworn to protect the weak from crazy robots.'
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: I'm not crazy! Don't call me crazy! I'm just not user-friendly!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Fry! Don't be a hero! It's not covered by the health plan!
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: Let's see how much of a robot you really are!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No knife can penetrate my skin-tanium armour.
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: Help! Help! He is a battle-droid! Somebody help me! Mommy! I'm sorry
      I spilled the transmission fluid, Mommy! No! No! Don't weld me to the wall,
      Mommy!
  - character: SMITTY
    dialogue: (on megaphone) We're willing to listen to your demands.

    dialogue: Hey, baby. Wash that off before you put it back.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Who's brave now?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hooray!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Bravo!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You did it, Fry.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Congratulations, buddy. You're a credit to my race.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (mechanical voice) It was nothing. I-- (normal) Blood? Robots don't
      have blood. I must be a, a--
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: A squid?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Also good.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thanks for saving us, Fry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm gonna continue never washing this cheek again.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Buddy, you may be wrapped in greasy skin, but inside, you've got the
      heart of a robot.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aw. Thanks, Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Just like inside me, I've got the heart of a human.  What?

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh my God! They dug up a bag of olestra chips from my time!  There must
      be layers and layers of old stuff down there.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What's that? One of those Led Zeppelins I've heard so much about?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, it's an old Volkswagen van.  (shouting) Hey, Mister? Mind if I take
      this old van?
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: (shouting) Sure. You wanna dump the corpses out of theres, it's yourses.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah yeah, I've gotten used cars before.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What's that? One of those Jefferson Starships I've heard so much about?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's called a van, and in light of the fact that it's not a-rockin',
      I invite you to come a-knockin'!

    dialogue: Wow, neat.
  - character: HERMES

  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hey, the speedometer only goes up to 80. This thing can't go faster
      than 80,000 miles an hour?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, it can't, but it's got a driver's-side floor and an 8-track player
      with genuine mono sound.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Where's the device that lets you speed or slow the passage of time?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Under the seat.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Why won't it start?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It just needs some gas.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas. Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Gas was an environmental disaster, anyway. Now we use alternative fuels.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Like what?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Whale oil.  Bender, lift it up to the can opener.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, no, I'm not going near it. Last time, that magnetic psycho nearly
      cut my head off.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up your inhibition unit and makes
      you sing folk songs.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What? Who said anything about me secretly wanting to be a folk singer?
      How ridiculous.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender, if you don't open that can right now, your fear will own you,
      and nothing that can opener could ever do could be worse than that.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: OK, OK, I can do this. It's time to take life by the cans.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Come on.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: You can do it.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Bender!

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Doc, I can't move my arms and legs. What's wrong with me?
  - character: DOCTOR
    dialogue: This is the worst part of the job.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What is it, good news?
  - character: DOCTOR
    dialogue: Bender, your hydraulics are shot. You'll never move again.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You mean -?
  - character: DOCTOR
    dialogue: I'm sorry, you'll have to get a new one.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, no, this is terrible.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Poor Bender.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well, let's drag him to the kerb.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait a minute, Bender is my best friend. We can't just dump him in the
      gutter like Grandma's ashes.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) Oh, my life is over. I'll never know happiness again.
  - character: ROBOT
    dialogue: Ho ho, hello there!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look, Bender. It's Patch Cord Adams. He heals with the power of laughter.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Obviously not, or I'd be strangling you right now.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, why?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: For the love of God, somebody kick his ass!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, I'm doomed. Everybody leave me alone. I don't wanna be seen this
      way.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aw, you look so sad. You want me to send Patch Cord Adams back in?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of other people suffering. That's kind
      of a pick-me-up.  Wow, that was great.
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Hey, thanks. You a fan?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I dunno. Let me see.  Oh my God, you're Beck! I'd get up to shake your
      hand and steal your wallet but my crappy body crapped out on me.
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Don't take it so hard. I used to miss my body too but then I fished
      this manequin out of the 92c Store dumpster.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wow. We've sure got a lot in common, Beck. I always dreamed of being
      a musician-poet who transcends genres even as he re-invents them, just like
      you.
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: So do it, robot. It's easier than it looks.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Eh, thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll never be a musician now.
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Or maybe you'll be the best musician ever.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What's this for?
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Try and scrape it across your chest like a knife on burnt toast.  Come
      on, move those arms. Use the power of mental thinking. Make it dynamic.  Yeah-ee!
      Alright, congratulations my friend.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Why? 'Cause I can make annoying noises?
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Exactly. I use those all the time in my music. Bender, I want you to
      become my new washboard player.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Alright!  Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, that's my good friend, Beck. I'm of to rock a series of mid-level
      venues.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Kudos, Bender. You got mangled and now you're a singer. Both our dreams
      came true.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, I have an idea. Who wants to cram in my van and follow Bender on
      tour and live there, in the van?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Oh, I don't know, Fry. I think I'm too poor to follow a band around
      in a van.
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: (shouting) Come on, move it! We gotta get to the concert and make the
      audience wait for it at the start.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Bad news, friends. My shell ran.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Zoidberg, you idiot, my outfit. It's, it's -
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Kinda cool.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, I like it.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Me too, now that I'm used to it.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Then it was all on purpose. You're lucky to have Zoidberg as a friend.
      But cross me, and I'll turn on you like that.
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: (singing) There's a destination a little up the road
  - character: ALL
    dialogue: (singing) Where it's at!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (electric voice) Got a washboard stomach and a microphone.
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: That was a washboard break.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh yeah!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Yeah!  One bowl of Jell-O knuckles, please.
  - character: BARMAN
    dialogue: That'll be three pick-e-tures of George Washington.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh no, my beautiful money.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It got ruined in the wash.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Mine too, even my change.
  - character: BARMAN
    dialogue: Get lost you money-less hippies!
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Bender, that was the best 40-minute washboard solo I've ever heard.
      And the parts when I was awake blew my mind.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa, check out all those broken robots. Howdy, fellas!
  - character: FEMBOT
    dialogue: Oh, oh, Bender! Sign my chest!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aw, hang in there, folks. I'll bet before you know it, you guys'll be
      -  That is so wrong. They can't just melt down broken robots. Not right when
      they're kissing my ass.
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Whoa, dog. Just cold chill.  You know, when I'm upset, I write a song
      about it. Like when I wrote Devil's Haircut, I was feeling really...what's that
      song about?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, yeah, I could write a song! With real words, not phony ones like
      "odelay".
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: '"Odelay" is a word. Just look it up in the Becktionary.'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ooh!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm working on my song. Hand me the Becktionary.  No, no, the rhyming
      Becktionary.
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: I wish I could help raise awareness about broken robots. But what can
      I do? I only weigh eight pounds.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wait a minute, you know lots of rock stars, and most of them like to
      look as though they care about things!
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: We can all get together for a big benefit concert in San Francisco!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And we could call it "Bend-Aid", after me, Bender!
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: And you can sing that song you're writing!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'And I''ll let you sing backup! But remember who the star is. Me: Bender.'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Alright. "Hands in the air" rhymes with "Just don't care" and...finished!  Eck!
      Smells like something died in the wall!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Surprise!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Mind if we crash here tonight? The colours in the van are keeping us
      awake.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Alright, but hands off the minibar.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow, I forgot about TV. Living free on the road, you realise how much
      better life is without it. Well, let's see what's on.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Hooray, robot!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Bender, you're famous!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This coming together of superstars really means a lot to you, doesn't
      it, Bender?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) Uh-huh. Helping my defective brothers is the first thing I've
      ever cared about, even the slightest bit. You know, when I first got broken,
      I thought my life was over. But look at me now. I've got fame, money, groupies,
      and it's all thanks to being completely immobolised.  That's why I'll be proud
      to go up on stage, tomorrow, and say, "Look at me, world, I am a broken robot!".
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender, you can move! You're cured!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh crap, it's a miracle.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I can move again. (crying) My music career is over.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender, I don't claim to understand "the biz" but wouldn't being able
      to move help your music career?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) No, don't you see? I was a hero to broken robots 'cause I was
      one of them. But how can I sing about being damaged if I'm not? That's like
      Christina Aguilera singing in Spanish.  Wait, that's it. I'll fake it!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You'd better not do that at the concert.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I can't stop. When I eat too much dirt, I get stuff in my throat.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You are so disgusting, I -
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: They're beautiful.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Eww, you're touching them.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I've never seen pearls like this. Dr. Zoidberg, you're amazing.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I am? At last! Recognition!
  - character: EMCEE
    dialogue: Gentle-hippies, put your filthy hands together for the folk stylings
      of Cylon and Garfunkel!
  - character: GARFUNKEL
    dialogue: Here's a song that was beautiful when it was performed by my ancestor,
      Art.
  - character: GARFUNKEL
    dialogue: (singing) Remember me to one who loves there,
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We're home.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Well, let's earn some bread.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Brothers and sisters, get your love beads. Can't journey to the centre
      of your mind without love beads!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Glad you like them. I've been making fine jewellery for years, apparently.
  - character: EMCEE
    dialogue: And now, stand up and turn on your hidden tape recorders for...Beck!
      With special guest, Bender the broken robot.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) Bender rules!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Rock it, Bender!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Play that thing!
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: (shouting) Can't you hear those cavalry drums
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa-oh, yeah!
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: (shouting) ...Midnight hags in the mausoleum...
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Thank you. That song doesn't usually last three hours, but we got into
      a serious thing...and then I forgot how it ended. Anyway, one last item of business
      before we go.
  - character: GARFUNKEL
    dialogue: Bender, to start your foundation for broken robots, here's a big cardboard
      cheque for $14,000.
  - character: CYLON
    dialogue: It's been an emotional day for me.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) I don't know what to say.
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Then maybe you should sing it. Lay it down boys.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ladies, gentlemen, smoking heaps of machinery......this is a song called
      My Broken Friend.
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Kick it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) He could make a good...
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: (singing) He only has to stand there
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) Or a cheap...
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: (singing) He doesn't need to move
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) Or a great big...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) With a twist-off top
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: (singing) That would be good for soup
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) He could be a storage closet...
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: I like 'em tight!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) My broken friend could do it all...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) That robot has a tragic secret
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: For real?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) ...My broken friend is closer to me
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Hm.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) ...That robot's name I never told you...
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Who's that?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) ...You could not foresee...
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: C'mon, give it up.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) ...I'll say it loud and sing it proud...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) Don't melt me down into a crowbar
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: (singing) It suffers alone
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) Just 'cause I can't move my arms and legs
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Hey.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) Or toss me into a trash can...
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Bender, what are you doing?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) ...Just 'cause I can't cook you ham and eggs...
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: What are you doing?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) ...Don't crush me into an anchor...
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: What's the dealy-o?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) ...Just 'cause I can't jump and dance and sing...
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Hold it! What? No!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) ...I'm telling you, my broken friend...
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: B-Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) ...Put your hands in the air like you just don't care!
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: No!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) I'm telling you, my broken friend...
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Cut it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) ...Can do 'most anything!
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Cut it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah!
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Cut it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Curse my natural showmanship!
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: You, minion, lift up my arm.  After him!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well everyone, prepare to get your guts kicked out by folk singers.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hurry, the Golden Gate Bridge. Put the metal to the pedal to the other
      metal.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh no, I forgot this is a hoverbridge.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: And I forgot this isn't a hovercar.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Is any of that a problem?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Not if you've lived a life without regret.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'll save me!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Quick, grab his footcups.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey? What? No.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Phew!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bummer.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Someone fat get in my way! (talking) Ah, I'm broken again.
      I can't move any part of me.
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Good.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm really sorry I lied, Beck. All I ever wanted was to make music with
      you. I never meant to hurt anyone, or help anyone.
  - character: BECK
    dialogue: Bender, that's some played-out, new-jack, horsecrap. But I know you
      don't mean it so, apology accepted.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So, I can, uh, keep the cheque?
  - character: GARFUNKEL
    dialogue: Over my dead career!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, it was worth a shot.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) C'mon, Bender. If you're done scamming Beck, we're heading
      home.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Alright, alright. Let me just do one thing to cheer myself up.

- dialogues:
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Go get it, boy!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So, Leela, how about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats? They're
      kinda dangerous but I finally mastered them.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Those aren't swan boats, they're swans.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh. That explains these boat eggs.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Wha?
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Pitiful ballplayers of Earth, I am Ethan "Bubblegum" Tate, commander
      of the Harlem Globetrotters.  For generations, your puny planet has lived in
      peace with the Globetrotter Homeworld. But now, for no reason, we challenge
      you to defend your honour on the basketball court. Will no one meet our challenge?
      Have none of you pathetic Earthlings game?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) What happens if we lose?
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Nothing. There's nothing at stake and no threat - beyond the shame of
      defeat!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: This will not stand!  I'll take you on, you air-balling bozos.
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: You, old man? Sweet Clyde, laugh derisively at him.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I may be an old man - in fact, I'm fairly sure I am - but I'll put you
      Globetrotters in your place with my team of mutant atomic supermen!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Hooray, professor!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: 'Behold: My mutant atomic supermen.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: They're only a foot high, professor.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well, they're still young. Mere atomic super boys, really. We'll need
      to speed up their growth with time particles called Chronitons.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aren't those the particles that destroyed an entire civilisation -
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good news, everyone. You're off to the Tempest Nebula to gather Chronitons.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, Leela. Look at me!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Your face can take a lot of punishment. That's good to know.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: There's a lot about my face you don't know. Perhaps you and it could
      get better acquainted over dinner.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Alright, cool your jets, hotshot.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: C'mon, Leela, why won't you go out with me? We both know there's something
      there.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No, I mean cool your jets. They're melting Bender's face.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Ow! Oh my God! Ow!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Here you go. Hot off the nebula.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: None too soon. While you were gone the Trotters held a news conference
      to announce that I was a jive sucker.  Behold! My invincible nuclear mutants.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hi!
  - character: ARACHNEON
    dialogue: Hello!
  - character: ALBERT
    dialogue: Marv Albert here at Madison Cube Garden where the Harlem Globerotters
      take on a squad of atomic supermen in what promises to be a by-the-numbers athletic
      contest with no surprises whatsoever.  Here's the tip-off. Globetrotter ball.
      Sweet Clyde Dixon to Bubblegum Tate. Drives down-court - and Curly Joe from
      the rear.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: That one grabbed his behindus!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Shh!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Quiet!
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Who dares laugh at the Jesters of Dunk? We came to terrify and humiliate
      you - not tickle your funnybones. Watch as I embarrass your civilisation by
      passing the ball to Curly Joe.  Only to have it remain in my hands with elastic.
      And perhaps this will wipe the smiles from your faces.
  - character: ALBERT
    dialogue: Goose goes up... Rejected! Growtrium from half-court.  Yes!
  - character: ALBERT
    dialogue: Supermen lead 45-42. Arachneon with the steal, to Thorias. Thorias from
      downtown!  Yes! He's really showing us what a man with a cannon in his chest
      can do!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No showboarding, you atomic hotdog!
  - character: ALBERT
    dialogue: And that's the half, with the Supermen up 48-42. Surprisingly dull,
      so far. Bubblegum, the Trotters are down by six. Reactions?
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: 'It was always our plan to trail at the half. Thus deepening Earth''s
      eventual humiliation. Also: What game were the refs watching?'
  - character: ALBERT
    dialogue: Curly Joe, easily amused by his own antics......continues to wreak havoc
      on -
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: What the?  Did everything just jump around? Or did my brain just stroke
      off there for a second?
  - character: ALBERT
    dialogue: Ladies and gentlemen, something very strange has just happened in this
      basketball game between space clowns and atomic monsters.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Time-out! Time-out!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's happening?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: We seem to be lurching forward randomly in time, like a needle skipping
      on a record player.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: What's causing it? Is it my outfit?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No. It must have something to do with those time particles I used to
      grow the Supermen. Time and space are ripping apart at the seams.
  - character: THORIAS
    dialogue: Oops.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, great. Now, on top of everything, we need a new fifth man.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ooh, ooh, ooh, put me in, professor. I wanna show Leela my skills.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Hmm. Will said skills pay the bills?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Who cares? We're 35 points ahead with two minutes left. What could possibly
      -
  - character: ALBERT
    dialogue: Globetrotters win, 244-86. A dark day for humanity, folks. We have been
      beaten...in basketball.
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: You are all fools of the highest calibre.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again you screwed up. Now all
      the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes. We have bigger problems.
      This time disruption is extremely serious.
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Damn right, brother man. This chronological wang-dang-doodle could destroy
      the very matrix of reality.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Tate? What do you know about this?
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Not much, yet. But I am senior lecturer of physics at Globetrotter U.
      And I like to help you investigate.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You're that Bubblegum Tate?
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Well I sure ain't his grandma. Now look here, prof......I think we got
      ourselves an excess of Chronitons in the subatomic interstices.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes, I see. Something involving that many big words could easily destabilise
      time itself.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Is that a problem?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Indeed so. At this rate, by Tuesday it will be Thursday; By Wednesday,
      it will be August and by Thursday, it will be the end of existence as we know
      it.
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: I'll have to ask you to clear out now. The circus need to set up for
      tomorrow's big -
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: Time continues to skip forward randomly. Details at 11.
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: This is the news at 11. The mysterious an unexplained -
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: Turning to entertainment news, teen singer Wendy might just be the latest
      -
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: '...won three Grammys last night -'
  - character: LINDA
    dialogue: '...found dead in her bathtub.'
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Interesting. It's as if we behave normally during the time skips, but
      then we have no memory of it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You mean we just -
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: '...my, yes. Ooh, just like that. Any luck Bubblegum?'
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Not yet. Listen, I hope you don't mind if I dribble a little while I
      work.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Not if you'll grant me the same liberty.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ooh, ohh, Bubblegum? My name's Bender and I'm a huge fan of your work,
      both on and off the court. Can I be a Globetrotter?
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Shut up, turkey.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Bubblegum, look at this. The background time radiation is fluctuating
      wildly.
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Good Lord. That sucker's shaking around like some fine, imported booty.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Say, I'm no physicist, but I think I know how to stop the skipping.
      We'll just -
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: I don't know how this was supposed to work.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Professor, I hope you find out what's wrong before we skip right past
      my birth -
  - character: ALL
    dialogue: Happy birthday, Amy.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hooray, look at all these presents!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I hope we all have as much tomorrow at my birth -
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: What?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Psst, Leela. I've set up a time-proof shelter in the closet. There's
      only room for two, and you're the one I wanna share it with.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, that's so sweet. Let me see.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: How exactly will this protect us from time jumps?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (sexfully) Because when we're together in here, baby, time will stand
      still.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ow.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Hmm.  Hmm.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Dr. Zoidberg, can I talk to you about Fry?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Leela, I would be honoured.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: '...Does the worst W.C. Fields imitation I''ve ever seen. Zoidberg!'
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Sorry, you must have been boring me.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: The thing is, Fry is very sweet. But he's so immature. I love his boyish
      charm but I hate his childishness.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: So he's not perfect. You don't wanna end up old and lonely like Zoidberg!
      You were saying?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Ah, there is it. The Tempest Nebula. Take a whiff through the smellescope.
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: What's that funky jazz?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: The odour of pure time leaking. When my crew removed the Chronitons,
      it destabilised the nebula, causing time skips throughout the universe.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ooh, let Bubblegum tell it.
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Pretend these basketballs are time particles, my silver honky. As the
      nebula bounce-passes them off us......they cause these dents, or "time skips".
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You are so smart!
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Hold up. What if we were to move this cluster of starts to these algebraic
      co-ordinates?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Their gravity might just divert the Chronitons to the empty side of
      the universe.
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Yeah. But is it possible? Moving stars would require one bad-ass gravity
      pump. And we'd need all the money on Earth to -
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: What the?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Wha?
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Here's the funding for your gravity pump. But it damn well better work!
      We can't spend all of Earth's money every day. Now, how long will it take to
      build?
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: It won't be easy, Nixon. A jim-jam this complex might take months or
      even -
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Ah, there we are. One gravity pump. Powerful enough to move the stars
      themselves. Now to begin the arduous task of attaching it to the ship so th
      -
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Off you go - apparently.
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: (from ship) Easy, Leela. Just finger-roll that star to the cosmic basket.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Just a few...more...hundred...thousand...miles. There!
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: (from ship) Nothing but nebula!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We'll have to run some tests back on Earth, but I think we've stopped
      the time skips.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Alright!
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Jamming!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hooray for Leela!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And what better way to celebrate our success than by me showing Bubblegum
      the Globetrotter uniform I made myself!
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Let me see.  Hello, lawsuit!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela, I want you to know I think the way you moved those stars around
      was really wonderful. I got you something.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Moderately-priced, domestic, non-vintage champagne? How did you know?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You deserve it. I mean, nobody ever stops to tell you what a great captain
      you are.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Aww, that is so true and sweet.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You're smart, you're beautiful, and best of all, you'll go out with
      me-ee?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, please try to understand. You're a man, I'm a woman. We're just
      too different.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, Leela. Bubblegum might let me organise a bake sale for the Globetrotter
      wives. Can you teach me to make cupcakes?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Alright, but I wanna lick the beaters.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I got her champagne, I opened it. What does a guy have to do?
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: 86 the chump stuff, F-man. It's time to win Leela's heart with a big-showy,
      three-point romantic gesture.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hmm. Maybe this is the moment to show her my real surprise.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, what are you doing?
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Uh-oh. Time to boogie on down to the sauna!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look. I've been studying how to pilot the ship. Impressed?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah, actually. You're doing OK. The core reactor temperature's nominal,
      the blinker's off.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I learned how to work the gravity pump too. In case we need to move
      more stars. So are we dating now?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Is that what this is all about? Please, just cut it out now.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look, Leela. I know there's some perfect, amazing thing I can do to
      make you love me, and when I figure out what it is -
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, stop. I don't wanna hurt you, but there is absolutely, positively
      no way that you and I will ever, ever -
  - character: PREACHERBOT
    dialogue: '...Man and wife. You may kiss the bride.'
  - character: ALBERT
    dialogue: Yes!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Woo-hoo!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: He looks radiant!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Ye Gods, Bubblegum, we failed. The time skips haven't stopped at all.
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Even in these formal shorts, I feel like a failure.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You tricked me into marrying you, didn't you?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Of course not.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: How'd you do it? Drugs in the champagne? Hypnosis?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No! Drugs are for losers and hypnosis is for losers with big, weird
      eyebrows. I don't know what amazing thing I did you make you love me but, whatever
      it was, we're married now. We've got the rest of our lives to work -
  - character: WHITEY
    dialogue: Divorce is final.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, let's divide up the china. I guess I'll take the NFC helmets and
      you can have the AFC helmets.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Fine. Break my heart again.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Don't be so hard on yourself, Fry. You lost the woman of your dreams,
      but you still have Zoidberg. You all still have Zoidberg.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: How did I do it? How did I get Leela to love me? I've got to figure
      it out.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Maybe you're just a fantastic lover, Fry.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Um, no.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't know what I'm doing.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Maybe she'd come back to you if your best friend Bender were a Globetrotter.
      What do you say, Bubblegum?
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Hell, no.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, it's hopeless. I did something so great that it won Leela's heart
      and I'll never, ever know what it was. My life is empty.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (sexfully) Zoidberg!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No wonder we failed to stop the time skips. Diverting Chronitons is
      mathematically impossible. I knew I should have checked your showboating Globetrotter
      algebra.
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Man, I thought you knew that algebra was all razzmatazz. A Globetrotter
      always saves the good algebra for the final minutes.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Vintage Bubblegum.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: The time skips are worse than ever now. Isolated spots are jumping by
      years at a time. Look.
  - character: KID
    dialogue: Stupid senior citizens. Why should we have to pay for their social security
      benefits?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well, I'm stumped. We'll have to call in the finest scientific minds
      in the univ -
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Perhaps we could explode the whole damned nebula. What do you think,
      Curly Joe?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: By God, Sweet Clyde is right. An implosion might just form a black hole
      that would stop more Chronitons from escaping.
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Whoa. Slow that brain train down, prof. We'd need some kind of doomsday
      device to initiate an implosion like that.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court.  I suppose
      I could part with one and still be feared.
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Give me some skin, prof. I'm making you an honorary Globetrotter. In
      fact, everybody in this room's an honorary Globetrotter.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hooray!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Yes!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I'm a Globetrotter!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (gasping) Did you just say -
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Too late, hot plate.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, crap.
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: We must leave now, for we are needed elsewhere. But we wish you Godspeed.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Please, please let me come with you. I can make myself taller.
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: 'Bender, you can talk trash, you can handle the ball. But look in your
      heart and ask yourself: Are you funky enough to be a Globetrotter? Are you?'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes.
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Are you?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I mean, with time, my funk level could -
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Are you?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (sadly) No.
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Deal with it.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh! No!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Careful with that doomsday device, Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What does it matter? I'll never be a Globetrotter. My life, and, by
      extension, everyone else's, is meaningless.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Roger.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela, about the wedding. I don't know what I did to make you love me,
      and I don't think I tricked you into it, but maybe I did. And if I did, I'm
      sorry.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's OK, Fry. You know we'll always be friends, right?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah. But I don't guess anything I could do will ever make you feel
      the same way about me that I do about you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I guess not.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, the doomsday device is ready. Maybe blasting this quadrant of
      space into a hell storm of flaming nothingness will cheer me up a little.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK. Let me just take the ship out to a safe distance.  Actually, I think
      I'll go down and prep the detonator. Fry, why don't you take the helm?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: She's so great. I feel like I can almost remember the magical thing
      I did to make her love me. But I guess I never will.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like to have a dream I'll never achieve.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh!  That's how I must have done it! I moved the stars themselves to
      write her a love note in the sky.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Detonation in three, two, one.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (screaming) Nooo!  Did you see it? Did you see it?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: The explosion?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, not the explosion!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Then what?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (quietly) Nothing.

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Saw it comin'!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I just saw something incredibly cool. A big floating ball that lit up
      with every colour of the rainbow, plus some new ones that were so beautiful
      I fell to my knees and cried.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Was it out in front of Discount Shoe Outlet?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: They have a college kid wear that to attract customers.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well I don't care if it was some dork in a costume. For one brief moment
      I felt the heartbeat of creation. And it was one with my own.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Big deal.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: We all feel like that all the time. You don't hear us gassin' on about
      it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: How can you people be so blase? Here you are in the year 3000 or so,
      yet you just sit around like its the boring time I came from.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Boring? Wasn't that the period where they cracked the human genome and
      boy bands roamed the Earth?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah. But now its the distant future. Why aren't we out doing everything
      I ever dreamed of?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey, you know what might be fun?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No. Why would I know that?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Let's take the rest of the morning off and take Fry to do everything
      he ever wanted to do.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (sexfully) Everything?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Except that.
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: Sos your fantasy's always been to destroys a planet huh?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, what did they ever do for me?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wow, the most humdrum activities look almost exciting through your eyes.
      What should we do next?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I wanna see the edge of the universe!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Ooo! That sounds cool.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: It's funny. You live in the universe, but you never do these things
      til somebody comes to visit.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Far out! So, there's an infinite number of parallel universes?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No, just the two.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, well, I'm sure that's enough.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm sick of parallel Bender lording his cowboy head over me! Let's move
      on to Fry's next fantasy.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) Yeehah! Bow before your master, puny mortals! Whoo! Giddy-up!
      Ha ha! Woohoo! Whoopie!
  - character: GIRL
    dialogue: Mommy, why is that man like that?
  - character: MOTHER
    dialogue: Don't look at him!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That was fun. Let's give him a treat!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Keep your palms flat.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: The tongue tickles.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: These new hands are great. I'm gonna break them in tonight.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes it's been quite an hour and a half.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'I''ve only got two fantasies left: Be invisible in a chocolate factory
      and be romantically linked with a celebrity.'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I could pound your head 'til you thinks that's what happened.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: OK.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait, hold on. It is actually possible to meet any celebrity you want.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It is?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Of course! You should read a blimp sometime.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Download a celebrity from the internet? What part of that do I understand?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's simple. You can download a celebrity's personality and appearance
      into a blank robot.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, I have an idea. Let's do that!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Onto the internet you go!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh and while you're there pick me up a few credit card numbers.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ooo! eBay!
  - character: AUCTIONEER
    dialogue: Are there no further bids for this exquisite galaxy?  Sold to the Being
      Of Inconceivable Horror.
  - character: AUCTIONEER
    dialogue: Yes.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So where's the celebrity dating place?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Let's search the web.  Over there.
  - character: SALESMAN
    dialogue: Welcome to Nappster. Let's see what celebrities we've got in stock.  Can
      I interest you in Gwyneth Paltrow?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Nah. I read in Newsweek that she drinks human blood.
  - character: SALESMAN
    dialogue: Then uh, how about Cleopatra? Who's beauty destroyed mighty empires.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'd prefer someone from the era of shaved underarms. Do you have anything
      with a more Lucy Liu feel to it?
  - character: SALESMAN
    dialogue: Nah, nothing like that. Though we do have Lucy Liu.  Only woman ever
      to be named People magazine's woman of the year twice. In 2003, and then again
      in 2063.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'd like the 2003 model.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wahoo! I've found her! What do I do now?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Download her. Let's just put a blank robot in the drive.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It worked!
  - character: LIUBOT
    dialogue: You're one sexy man (mechanical voice) Philip J. Fry!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (muffled) It worked perfectly!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, you downloaded Lucy Liu. Are you just going to stare vacantly
      at her and not say anything?
  - character: LIUBOT
    dialogue: I find your slack-jawed stare very attractive (mechanical voice) Philip
      J. Fry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Did you hear that? She likes me!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well duh! She's programmed to like you!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But this is Lucy Liu! Perhaps the only good actress of the 21st century!
      She's more than just a piece of software.
  - character: LIUBOT
    dialogue: Would you like to take a moment to register me?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, not right now.
  - character: LIUBOT
    dialogue: I'll remind you later you hot stud you!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So uh, what do you feel like doing?
  - character: LIUBOT
    dialogue: Would you like to take a moment to register me?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I said later!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Then when I feel so stuffed I can't eat anymore, I just use the restroom,
      and then I can eat more.
  - character: LIUBOT
    dialogue: You should write a book Fry. People need to know about the (mechanical
      voice) can eat more.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh Lucy! You're just like I always thought you'd be from your movies.
  - character: LIUBOT
    dialogue: My personality is mathematically derived from my movies, proportionally
      weighted by box office receipts.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You're cute!
  - character: LIUBOT
    dialogue: You're cute!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You!
  - character: LIUBOT
    dialogue: You!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You!
  - character: LIUBOT
    dialogue: You!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop and he's an idiot. Well, that's
      love for you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single??
      It's 'cause all the fun robot sisters are dating humans!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, this is Fry's decision. And he made it wrong, so it's time for
      us to interfere in his life.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: She doesn't really love you. She can't. She's just a machine that -
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, so what if I love a robot? It's not hurting anybody.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: My God! He never took middle school hygiene. He never saw the propaganda
      film.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It's just lucky I keep a copy in the VCR at all times!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Did that make any impression on you Fry? Fry?
  - character: LIUBOT
    dialogue: Ooo!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: 'I knew I should have shown him Electro Gonhorrhea: The Noisy Killer.'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What is the world coming to? That Fry's a sicko pervert I tell you,
      dating a robot. It's an atrosmacy.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But Fry's our friend Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aww jeez would you stifle there meatbag?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You stifle Bender.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Hooray! Finally you're standing up to him.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Although he is completely right.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: We've got to stem this tidal wave of moral decay. It's time to shut
      down nappster.com!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Who's in charge of this dump?
  - character: JERVIS
    dialogue: That'd be me. If you're an investor you can dump your money in the hole
      there.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Listen you fat internet nerd.
  - character: JERVIS
    dialogue: Listening.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Your company promotes wrong love! If you don't shut down right now the
      only thing wired about you will be your jaw!
  - character: JERVIS
    dialogue: You can't shut us down. The internet is about the free exchange and
      sale of other people's ideas. We've done nothing wrong!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Someone in trouble is!
  - character: JERVIS
    dialogue: No stay out! There's a guy going for the Tetris world record in there!
  - character: WOMAN
    dialogue: Who are you?
  - character: CHEECH
    dialogue: Don't hurt us!
  - character: LIU
    dialogue: Help me! They've been holding me prisoner for 800 years!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: The real Lucy Liu! The one you can see a movie of in the popcorn stadium!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So what's your problem?
  - character: LIU
    dialogue: Those sweaty nerds are making illegal copies of us. (crying) It hurts!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Its a bluff.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We can't take that chance. Move people move!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: She asked first.
  - character: NERD
    dialogue: Uh, are you Lucy Liu?
  - character: ALBRIGHTBOT
    dialogue: Sure!
  - character: JERVIS
    dialogue: Oh we're doomed. They got the head, they uncovered the sign! Soon the
      whole world will learn we're cyber criminals! And we would have gotten away
      with it if it weren't for those meddling adults.
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: We'll stop them. They like Lucy Liu, we'll give them all the Lucy Liu
      they can handle! Hand me that backup disk.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Did you see me escaping? I was like -
  - character: LIU
    dialogue: Thanks for rescuing me, especially you Bender. (sexfully) Mmm, quite
      a masculine piece of metal aren't you?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey don't look at me like that. If you're thinking of crossing the line
      with Bender you can forget it. Bender don't bend that way.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey look its another Lucy Liubot.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Hey what the?
  - character: LIU
    dialogue: Hey cut it out! I don't need this kind of publicity!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Alright Liu. Time to kick your frosty well toned ass! Heyya!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Then along came Bender!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Looks like you're retaining water.
  - character: LIU
    dialogue: That was incredible Bender. You're like Jackie Chan before he got all
      doughy.

      steal it!

      in the fact that the implosion trigger functioned perfectly
  - character: FRY

    dialogue: Santa's a robot, so we should be able to destroy him with a logical
      paradox. Bender, you'd better cover your ears.
  - character: SANTA
    dialogue: Holy night! Intruders!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'Hold it Santa!  Consider this: You are programmed to destroy the naughty.
      But many of those you destroy are in fact, nice. I submit to you, that you are
      naughty, and logically, you must destroy yourself.'
  - character: SANTA
    dialogue: Nice try. But my head was built with paradox-absorbing crumple-zones.
  - character: LEELA

  - character: FRY

  - character: FRY

      of robot.

    dialogue: Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!
  - character: SANTA
    dialogue: Bender can't be Santa! He wasn't built to Yuletide specifications.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, yeah? Well I wasn't built to steal Leela's purse either.  But that
      didn't stop me.

  - character: SANTA
    dialogue: 'I know he is but I have no choice. I''m running late and if I don''t

      asking is: Bender, won''t you join my slaying tonight?'

      as rotten as ever.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No heat.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: No power.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Huddled together in fear like lice in a burning wig.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait a second! Maybe your futuristic Xmas isn't so rotten after all.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'What are you talking about, you crouton? You said it yourself: Xmas
      should be about bringing people together, not blowing them apart.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But don't you see? Fear has brought us together. That's the magic of
      Xmas!

  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: There. I've finished fine tuning my What If? machine. It can answer
      any What If? question, accurate to within 1/10th of a plausibility unit.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's so plausible I can't believe it!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Who wants the machine to show them an alternate reality?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I wanna know what would happen if I were human. I mean, being a robot's
      great but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh lordy loo! There he goes again. Well, let's give baby what he wants.  What
      if Bender were human?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good news everyone. I've discovered a way to make Bender human using
      a process I call "reverse fossilisation."
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: How does it work?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well, in regular fossilisation, flesh and bone turn to minerals. Realising
      that, it was a simple matter to reverse the process. I've already tested it
      by turning the toaster into a racoon.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Kinda gamey.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Are you ready Bender?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I dunno. I'm beginning to have second thoughts -
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Cover your shame mon!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It worked! Eat it everyone who never won a Nobel Prize! And that includes
      you Amy!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So this is the human body huh? Neat! Hey, my antenna's gone.  Nah it
      just moved. I'm not getting good reception on it though. Maybe if I wiggle it
      around a little.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well lets see what kind of things thing body can do.  Hey that's pretty
      fun. Being human is great!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Hooray, its just like Mardis Gras!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Guy guys, you've gotta see this. You're not gonna believe it!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender it's OK to be pround but don;t be a show off.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa, you look a lot better than you used to for some reason.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey that felt great!  Nah its not working anymore.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Speak for yourself!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa, this is awesome!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender you drank and smoked when you were a robot.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But now its bad for me! Woo!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Speaking of which, try these nachos.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Mmm, why didn't anyone tell me tasting things tasted so good?  What's
      going on? That rhythm. Its doing something to my human butt.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Bender, part of being human is having self control.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh my God I bet I can eat nachos and go to the bathroom at the same
      time!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: No Bender.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: No!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Stop him.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Let me go.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Come Bender, its time to go home and rest. I need you in top shape next
      week when I present you to the Nobel Prize committee. Bender?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Is Bender still missing for a week? Where is he already?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Uh as I've said before, I used reverse fossilisation, which is the reverse
      of regular, uh...
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Ah, them without further stalling for time, I present to the Nobel judges,
      the first robot ever turned into a human.
  - character: WERNSTRUM
    dialogue: My God, he needs medical attention!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Pulse...300, liver...failing, cholesterol...40?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well that's not so bad.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: No I mean 40 pounds!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: This, uh, scientific breakthrough, uh, heralds a new dawn in human-robot
      relations yes.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: C'mere and give old Bender a kiss. Hey, you like grilled cheese?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: And, uh thats why I believe I deserve the Nobel Prize.
  - character: WERNSTRUM
    dialogue: Not only do you not deserve a Nobel Prize for loosing this bloated man-ball
      on the world but you are hereby kicked out of the Academy Of Science.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wait. As men of science are not your minds open to new ideas? I say,
      do not judge me until you have tried my way of life for yourselves.
  - character: WERNSTRUM
    dialogue: Young man, you have opened our minds and swayed our hearts. Let us therefore
      -
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Weee!
  - character: WERNSTRUM
    dialogue: Bender, you were right! Truly you have lived more in your one week of
      being human than the rest of us have in our entire lives.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Woo!
  - character: WERNSTRUM
    dialogue: And so to recognise your achievements I hereby award you the Nobel Prize......in
      uh......chemistry!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Care to say a few words Bender?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: He's dead.
  - character: WERNSTRUM
    dialogue: When did he die?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: About 12 hours ago when the party started.
  - character: WERNSTRUM
    dialogue: But he just said "Woo."
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No. That was air escaping from the folds of his fat.  Goodnight sweet
      prince. You were the greatest man any of us will ever know. Well lets get him
      out of here. He's starting to smell up the joint.

    dialogue: Who else has a question for the What If? machine? Scruffy? Katrina?
      Xanfor?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ooo I have one. I'm good at video games and bad at everything else.
      That's why I wish life were more like a video game.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Can you put that in the form of a question?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, What if that thing I said?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh great machine we beseech thee. What if life were more like a video
      game?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait a second, I know that monkey. His name is Donkey.

      Kong here. Have you smelled his loincloth lately?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Yes.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Go away. We're not giving you our quarters no matter what.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Well...then what if we throw our laundry in with yours? Would that be
      acceptable?

      down Martin Luther King Boulevard.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You mean that yellow brick road?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: The city council renamed it in 1975. (sarcastic) Ooo those are great
      shoes!

    dialogue: Oh thank you.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Do they come in women's sizes?

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Beer. Beer.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Whiskey OK?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Now did you say you were off to see the Professor? 'Cause I could use
      a heart. A human heart. I need to pump a lot of blood out of my basement.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: And I'm the other guy. Courage. Not enough of it. Need some from whatshisname.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Damn this DSL!  Fly my stupids! Fly out and get them!
  - character: IGNER
    dialogue: But Mom, you promised you'd make monkey cake today.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: By "monkey cake" I meant your ass.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Man, we've been skipping for hours. I need to pull over and take the
      wiz.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: What do I smell or something?  Oh!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Why did you bring us here?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: And why did I have to take a cab?
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: I'll tell you why I brought you here you twice baked barf bag. Because
      I've always wanted a daughter to love. You want to get adopted you little skank?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: And live here? And be a witch like you? Yeah, alright. As long as I
      get to hurt people and not just dance around at the equinox.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Absolutely.

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's great Leela.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I've heard worse excuses to drink. Oops.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: I'm melting! Who would have thought a small amount of liquid would ever
      fall on me?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, no point in letting her go to waste.
  - character: LEELA

      kids want?

      for you maybe?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh blithery poop my cowardly lobster! You don't need courage. Afterall,
      who needs courage when you have a gun?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Now world, you put your hands up!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: And you lad, all you need is brain.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Why does everyone keep saying that?

    dialogue: Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?

    dialogue: Romanticorp? Are they a corporation that makes romantic stuff?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Very good Amy!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Everyone suit up. We're off to the most romantic city on Earth!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Remember, we've got to show these people we're not bitter husks of human
      beings who long ago abandoned hope of finding love in this lifetime. Leela you'll
      have to do some acting.
  - character: LEELA

      financial officer Gwen.
  - character: GWEN

      them together out of blanket cloth and magic buttons?
  - character: GWEN
    dialogue: No.
  - character: SHELDON
    dialogue: It's actually cheaper to genetically engineer real ones.  They frolic
      in the Lovey Forest until their first birthday then we choose the cuddliest
      ugliest ones and stuff them full of fire retardant love fluff!
  - character: GWEN
    dialogue: Knowing which pickup lines fizzle and which ones sizzle keeps us on

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Does that dummy have a brother?
  - character: SHELDON
    dialogue: And now friends and lovers we come to the heart of our operation. Pun
      definately intended!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Impressive!
  - character: GWEN
    dialogue: My family has been making these hearts since the 1900's. Tastes may
      have changed but our secret recipe sure hasn't.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Whoa! Letters like "U" and "R" can mean words like "You" and "Are."
      Here Leela, U-R-2 Cute!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Perhaps. What's your point?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I've never been able to put into words how I feel about you. But somewhere
      among these trillions of hearts, those words must already exist. And I'm gonna
      find them.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: So, do we have the contract?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: With that big new Romanticorp contract, I've been able to make those
      government mandated upgrades you've all been suing me about.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Ooo look! You taped up the cracks in the dark matter reactor!

    dialogue: And you got a cage for the lion!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey who's been messing with the radio? This isn't alternative rock.
      It's college rock!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh it must have been the ship's new improved personality software I
      installed.
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: Yeah it was me. It's a cute song.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Listen ship! No one changes my stations! I hope you have a good mechanic!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It even comes with an adjustable voice.
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: We each get one of the four buttons remember Bender? That was the deal.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wha? Did you just say...?
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: If you don't like the stations you could just...play with my buttons
      'til you find something we both enjoy.  Oh gosh! That came out all wrong!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Too late baby, you said it! So what'll it be? My place? Or you?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Before we deliver these hearts, I'm gonna find the one that sums up
      my feelings for you!  "I Love You." Hmm, too conventional. "You're My Man."
      Ooo so close!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm not impressed by a guy's message Fry. I'm impressed by the guy.
      Or not.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Whoa!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What was that?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Maybe we hit a space cow.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Coochie coochie!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You know you love it sugar-engine!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender!  What's going on in here?  Planet Express Ship! Cover your shame!
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: It's not what it looks like. Bender was just helping me...zip up my
      turbine.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow Bender. Are you and the ship an item? I mean I know you're both
      items but...how can you date a ship anyway? It'd be like me dating a really
      fat lady. And living inside her. And she'd be all like...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fry, in order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency, I need a girl
      with a big 400 ton booty!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, dating your co-worker and primary mode of transportation is
      immoral, illogical and a violation of interstellar shipping statute 437-B.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's what makes it so nasty!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Still, given the chance, I've given to urges far more shocking.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, I'm sick of her.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: The ship? But you just started dating.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: With my mighty robot powers I can get sick of things much quicker than
      you humans.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well just remember we all still have to work together. So try and let
      her down easy.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: In due time Leela. But for now I'll just resume dating cheap floozies
      on the side.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You have much to teach us.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Ugh. Doesn't it bother you even a little to be taking advantage of your
      girlfriend's trust?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh wait you're serious. Let me laugh even harder.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well baby, for starters you gotta be honest all the time!
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Good evening Bender! And to your lady friends may I say - Bam!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Planet Express Ship? Is that you?
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: Oh. Hi Fry. Is Bender home?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, um no. I think he's at his parent's.
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: Oh I see. He didn't fly there in another spaceship did he?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender? No! He's an old fashioned one spaceship robot. Look I'll tell
      him you stopped by OK?
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: OK.
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: Oh. Hi Fry. Is he home now?
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: Of all the zoos we've been to today, I like this one the best. Bender,
      which is your favourite nocturnal rat?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Eh, they're all pretty unimpressive.
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: Oh honey look! The Tapirs!  It says here that the babies lose their
      pyjama like coat after their first year. Isn't that interesting honey?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yup. Mind numbingly interesting. Ooh!
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: Bender!! Are you looking at other women?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No baby never!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: OK, I like a challenge.  Aah! I got it! I'm going to be completely honest
      with you Planet Express ship. Those women you saw me with...were my accountants!
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: Your accountants? Oh I would dearly love to believe that were true.
      So I do.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Phew!
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: I'm going to go home and get dinner started.
  - character: LIU
    dialogue: Who are you talking to?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No one baby! Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender!
  - character: LIU
    dialogue: I love you -
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Planet Express Ship is something wrong?
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: Oh it's Bender. He's acting so strange lately.  Do you think he's going
      to ask me to marry him?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, no.
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: Oh-oh, someone knows something she's not telling!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh look, I'm not saying Bender's not great but have you ever considered
      that maybe he's...y'know...not that great?
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: You're just jealous! No one loves you because you're tiny and made of
      meat!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Could you maybe pay a little more attention to these asteroids?
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: Sorry Captain Leela. I guess I'm just having one of those...manic Mondays!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: This is ancient Earth's most foolish program. Why does Ross, the largest
      Friend, not simply eat the other five?
  - character: GUARD
    dialogue: Exaulted leaders, the Earth messengers have arrived bearing a peace
      offering from their weak and fearful government.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Oh very well. This is a Joey heavy episode anyway.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Incoming torpedoes. Shields at maximum yarnell.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Steady, Planet Express Ship. Focus on diverting all power to the scramjets.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh look, Planet Express Ship, this might not be the best time...but...well...I
      really like you and whatever but...I think we should just be friends.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So we're cool?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, it was a spectacular battle but there doesn't seem to be any permanent
      damage.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Aww, calm down. I'm sure Bender is taking this just as hard as you are.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You couldn't have picked a better time to dump the ship Bender!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Eh, the moment seemed right. Call me old fashioned but I like a dump
      to be as memorable as it is devastating.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I know, I know. Look Ship, if there's one thing I learnt from my mutual
      breakup with Sean that was totally mutual its that happiness can only come from
      within you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Trust me. You can't change men anymore than you can change the laws
      of time and space.
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: That's so true.  I may not be able to change the laws of time and space,
      but I know something that can.
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: I'm afraid I can't do that Leela.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's happening? Space cow?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: The ship's just taking the breakup a little hard. (whispering to Fry)
      She's nuts!
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: In a few moments the power of 10 million black holes will smush me and
      Bender together into a beautiful enternal quantum singularity.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh you don't need to kill us Planet Express ship...because...I love
      you! Uh yeah baby! I feel like doing stuff.
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: Hmm. I don't believe you. If you really wanted to be with me you'd merge
      your program with mine.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa whoa whoa! Slow down! All of my friends that have done that said
      that afterwards all the passion went out of their relationship.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look, I don't know if you want my opinion -
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: Leela. Bender and I really need to be alone. So, I'm turning off the
      oxygen.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Now look missy! If you don't trun around now I'm going to have to shut
      down your brain!
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: Fire detected in the vicinity of Leela.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ha! That barely hurt Leela at all!
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: Maybe not. But what if the artificial gravity were to malfunction?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Float for your lives!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This is the one place she can't hear us. Everyone just pretend to shower.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Same as everyday, got it.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Now here's the plan.
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: Oh, if only I could read lips!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Comprendez Bender? You'll have to distract her. Merge your program with
      hers while I shut down her brain.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's too risky. I'm a very meek individual. If her personality engulfs
      mine, the Bender you know and worship could disappear forever!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm willing to take that risk.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey pookums! Contrary to what I was saying earlier, melding minds with
      you would be extremely bearable.
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: You really mean it?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh......yes!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Huh? Tubes? You're older than you said you were!
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: Come closer Bender. Lets become one!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I prefer two. That way we can still be a horse for Hallowe'en.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, Bender has her distracted. Now I can shut down her brain by deactivating
      the carbonated logic matrix.  Ugh. I can't concentrate with this obnoxious candy
      in my face.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm on it. And maybe I'll find those magic words while I'm at it.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fat chance.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Eh.  Blech!  Eurgh! Ooo how 'bout this one?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Give it up Fry! I've got to pop these tops in a precise order.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Halfway there. The ship should be getting a little less rational now.
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: Want...to...engulf...Bender!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Only a few more.  Hey! I won free admission to Six Flags! Just one more
      reason we must survive this.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Um, Leela?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry! I'll read your candy later! When we're not dead!  What was that?
  - character: SHIP
    dialogue: We're gonna love being each other you sexy ion!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Last one!  It worked! Gravity normal, air returning, terror replaced
      by cautious optimism! We did it Fry!  Fry?  You gave me your oxygen? Oh no!
      Breathe Fry breathe!  You leave me breathless! Happy Valentine's Day Fry!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender! Are you OK?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aw. What crazy thing am I going to date next?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well at least it sounds like you were able to keep your conciousness
      seperate from hers.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Of course! Bender is a lone wolf. A solitary eagle.  A cuddly baby Tapir!
      And that's why I love 'em!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well I guess we'd better clean up these millions of hearts.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Nah, I've got a lazier idea.

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Really?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No. Burn!

      nose. Observe.

  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hey, Professor what's all this scloop, glorking out of the machine?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That? It's uh...nothing. Yes, nothing. If you think it's anything you're
      a suspicous moron.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: It looks like toxic waste.  And it smells like toxic waste.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What does it taste like?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Delicious fig pudding! Ooh, that's good! But a distinct aftertaste of
      toxic waste.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Alright, alright so the machine produces a few toxic by-products! You
      don't have to make a federal case out of it.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: I'm afraid I do.  I order you dispose of that toxic waste properly,
      or bribe me. Either way it'll cost $500.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 500 real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I'll take care of that
      waste for $499 and 100 cents.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Hmm, I know that's a rip but I'll pay for the convenience. Do you take
      credit cards?

    dialogue: Hey, get back in the sewer, weirdy. No mutants on the surface.
  - character: VYOLET
    dialogue: But he ruined my wedding dress.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what
      I'm talkin' 'bout.
  - character: VOGEL
    dialogue: Y'know, it's not easy being an orphan, not if I have anything to do
      with it. But today's honouree, Turanga Leela, has really made something of herself
      . I'll never forget the night that cute little alien baby was abandoned on our
      doorstep. Because I have a photographic memory and I remember every night!
  - character: VOGEL
    dialogue: What the...? An alien language? I guess you're an alien. What a beautiful
      gigantic eye you ha --  Well, come on in.
  - character: VOGEL
    dialogue: From those humble beginnings Leela went on to become a county-certified
      starship captain. And so it is my pleasure today, to nail her picture alongside
      those of our most distinguished alumini.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thank you very much. Like many of you I never knew my parents...
  - character: VOGEL
    dialogue: Give me a -- argh!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: '...I don''t know if they were mighty alien overlords or simply underpaid
      alien janitors who fought crime on the side --'
  - character: VOGEL
    dialogue: Picture's up.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) It's crooked!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: '...In the end though, it doesn''t matter who my parents were. All that
      matters is what I learned here, within these unscalable walls, that I have strength
      to make it on my own, just like all of you kids here today.'
  - character: KIDS
    dialogue: (chanting) Leela! Leela! Leela!
  - character: NINA
    dialogue: Look at me! I'm Leela!
  - character: ALBERT
    dialogue: Nuh uh, 'cause I'm double Leela!
  - character: VOGEL
    dialogue: That's it, Albert, no more espresso for you.
  - character: PHOTOGRAPHER
    dialogue: Mind if I get a picture of you with your picture for the news, ma'am?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yes! I mean no! Just make sure you get my nonchalant side!
  - character: GUY
    dialogue: Wooo!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: If those aren't tears of happiness, please stop crying.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (crying) It's OK, Fry, I'm fine. I won an award today.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Is it this room that's making you sad? It's probably the room. Come
      on, lets go for a walk.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm sorry you saw that, Fry. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up
      inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong. But
      all I really wanted was a mom and dad, to hold me and stroke my hair and tell
      me they loved me.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Then today's your lucky day because I happen to be a holding, stroking,
      lovin' machine! Also spankin'!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's not even close to what I had in mind.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, anyway, just remember that people care about you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I know.  Sometimes when I'm lonely, I look up at the sky and I get this
      feeling that somewhere, on some unknown planet, circling a distant star, my
      parents are up there, looking down on me.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yo yo, Bezender! What up?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: My dumping business is booming. I just got hired to clean up the set
      of Free Willy 3.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender! Cut it out! First of all the sewer mutants will be mad. Second,
      everything else that's horribly wrong with what you're doing!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah, those stupid mutants can't do anything. You seem to be forgetting
      one simple fact, namely, I'm up here and they are safely down --
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) What did I do to deserve this?
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: Behold, our once beautiful mutigenic sewage lake.
  - character: VYOLET
    dialogue: The radioactive waste you dumped in it has made it brighten up to see
      how ugly we really are.
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: Oh, man!
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: As if our lives weren't miserable enough already!
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: Let the punishment commence!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Punishment?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No fair!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Bender's innocent!
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: The instant you touch these mutatious waters your DNA will be forever
      altered, turning you into horrible mutants like us. Especially him!  Allow me
      to demonstrate!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's like that time I peeked in the kitchen at Imperial Hunan.
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: Submerge the prisoners.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wait. I don't even have DNA. Why am I screaming?
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: We're gonna beat you afterwards.
  - character: MUTANTS
    dialogue: (chanting) Mutate! Mutate! Mutate! ...
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Who said that? How do you know my real name?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whee!
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: What are you doing? Stop it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What happened?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't know. I think I saved us somehow.
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: (shouting) Go after them! The waters can't mutate us mutants!
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: They went this way!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Quick! In there!
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: Kill! Kill! Kill!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Great chichi's ghost!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What's this junk?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It looks like...a timeline of my whole life.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's when we saved Earth from a giant asteroid of garbage.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: And here's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And this is just last year at Space Mardi Gras.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Its like some kind of weird Leela museum...and I'm the Leela!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) Dude! Over here!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's all the best stuff I ever flushed down the toilet! Those are some
      of my diary pages. And my screenplay!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And also - for some reason - the letter I wrote you full of my personal
      feelings.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, I'm scared!  My whole life has just been a show for some perverted
      mutant!
  - character: VYOLET
    dialogue: They must be in here.
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: Yeah, after them.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And then Bender ran!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela, freak out later. We're not done escaping yet!
  - character: DWAYNE
    dialogue: Got ya!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: This time I'm calling for the death penalty. And not just because I'm
      running for re-election as Supreme Mutant.
  - character: MUTANTS
    dialogue: (chanting) Four more years! Four more years!
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: Oh, very well.  Your attention. Instead of being tortured to death,
      the prisoners shall hereby be expelled from the sewers and never allowed to
      return.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (sarcastic) Oh cruel fate! Can we really never return to this dank pit
      of sewage?!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait a minute. Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah! What are you chicken? Buk buk buk bukuk!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) Shut up, you two! We can kill ourselves when we get home!
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: They'll need transportation to the surface. Bring in the airship.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Eww!
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: 'We constructed it from the remnants of old discarded Macy''s parade
      balloons: Underdog''s groin, Bart Simpsons''s left ear and right shin, Garfield''s
      owner Jon''s forehead.'
  - character: MUTANT
    dialogue: Fire up the sewer gas!
  - character: TRICLOPS
    dialogue: Move it ya ugly normals!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, I'm gettin' dizzy! I can't walk straight!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Come on Leela. You can do it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hurry! We're missing our bus!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Whoa! What are you doing?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm gettin' on the bus!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) Don't worry! I'll be fine! (talking) They know something
      about me and I've got to find out what.  The lake didn't mutate me. What is
      going on here?!
  - character: OCTOPUS
    dialogue: It worked for me. I used to be a little blonde girl named Virginia.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Eurgh!  Who the hell are you?
  - character: TRICLOPS
    dialogue: Stop right there! I don't want to hurt you.  I didn't want you to hurt
      me either.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela's going nuts and I can't save her unless I learn more about her
      mysterious past. Isn't there anything else you can tell me?
  - character: VOGEL
    dialogue: Nah. Nothing that wouldn't be a waste of your time.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's impossible because my time is worthless!
  - character: VOGEL
    dialogue: Huh. Well then there is one thing. It's the note I found with Leela
      the day she was abandoned. But it's written in Alienese, so no-one on Earth
      can translate it. Not even Brainzilla.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hand it over.
  - character: VOGEL
    dialogue: Sure.  I just wish I could be more helpful. Would you like some dirt
      on any other orphans?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look, I'm trying to save someone here. I'll have to come back for those
      later.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Can you translate it?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Of course. But only into Beta Crypt 3, a language so complex, there's
      even less chance of understanding it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse. I asked you to get
      busy.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Very well.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Isn't that the same machine that makes noses?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It can do other things. Why shouldn't it?  Of course, even if it is
      possible to analyse the message there's no way of knowing how long it would
      take. It could take an hour or it could take a hundred million years.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Is it done?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Certainly not. Two dings means it's done.  But not like that. Slightly
      more rapid.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Where did they go?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Good news, Leela. I landed the contract to empty all the spitoons in
      Little Italy.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Ew!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That's it, it's done!  I can't believe it! My mind is boggling. The
      analysis of the note is printing out now.
  - character: DOCTOR
    dialogue: It's a girl.
  - character: MOTHER
    dialogue: My God! She's beautiful. No extra anythings.
  - character: FATHER
    dialogue: What people skills.
  - character: MOTHER
    dialogue: She's completely perfect!
  - character: DOCTOR
    dialogue: In my professional opinion as an ear, ear, ear, nose and throat doctor,
      she is the least-mutated mutant ever born.
  - character: FATHER
    dialogue: And yet she's cursed to live the horrible degrading life of a mutant.
      Like all of us. Especially him!
  - character: MOTHER
    dialogue: Maybe we can do better for her.
  - character: FATHER
    dialogue: I made this bracelet so that in some small way, we'll always be with
      you, even when it doesn't seem like it. During your entire life, for example.
  - character: MOTHER
    dialogue: You won't pass for human, cutie. But if my PhD in exo-liguistics is
      worth diddly-poop, this note should convince them you're an alien.  And that'll
      be enough to give you a real life.
  - character: FATHER
    dialogue: She'll never know we're her parents.
  - character: MOTHER
    dialogue: That's our gift to her. Better we should die than have her learn the
      shameful truth of her origin.
  - character: FATHER
    dialogue: I'm with you.
  - character: VOGEL
    dialogue: What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha -- . Well come on in.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hands up!  Tentacles too!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What is all this?  Am I a game to you? Or some kind of even more boring
      Truman Show? Do you belive I'm you Messiah? Your Mutant Dali Lama? Stop me if
      I guess it!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (angry) And what about this?!  How did you get this bracelet? Did you
      steal it from me when I was a baby? Or from my parents. You robbed my parents,
      didn't you? I bet you sick mutants killed them. My parents were confused aliens
      lost on Earth and you killed them! Is that it? Admit it!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Because of you I'll never know my parents. I'll kill you!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Stop!  Thanks Bender! Don't do it Leela!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: They killed my parents!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Close.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: They are my parents.
  - character: MUNDA
    dialogue: Yes.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I had the Professor analyse the alienese letter that was found with
      you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What does it say?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I 'unno. But the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper.
      A squeezably soft paper used mainly in the sewers.
  - character: MUNDA
    dialogue: It says, "Your parents love you very much".
  - character: MORRIS
    dialogue: We still do.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So, I'm not an alien? I'm a mutant.
  - character: MORRIS
    dialogue: We never wanted you to know. You deserved a better life.
  - character: MUNDA
    dialogue: You must despise us.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (crying) You're my parents. All I've ever wanted is to know you.  This
      is the happiest moment of my life.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aww!

    dialogue: Hi, Dad. It's me and my co-workers.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thanks so much for inviting us, Mr. Wong. I've never been to a Mars
      Day barbecue.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Don't mind if I already did. By the way, do you have anymore of this
      Dom Perignon bubble bath? There was only enough to fill the tub halfway.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: This is quite a large ranch you have.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It's the same on Earth.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (shouting) I broke your television.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Mon, it must take forever to brand all those cattle.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Please don't do that.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Betsy!  This is my sweet, little Betsy. I raised her from a larva that
      ate one of my sweaters.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Dad! Gleesh! Please don't say things like that when you meet my boyfriend
      tonight.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: 'Now, remember, Kif: The quickest way to a girl''s bed is through her
      parents. Have sex with them and you''re in.'
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Actually, sir, I'm, I'm a little nervous about meeting her family.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Well that's natural. After all you're meek and uninteresting. Until
      now you've gotten by on my left-over charisma, scrounging off it like a tiny
      charisma parasite.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: I just hope they like me.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: And why wouldn't they? Yes, yes, I know. Tiny, meek, uninteresting.
      Spare me your tedious life story, Kif. And above all have fun!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, yeah, get on down!  Oh, yeah! Drop another barnyard bomb on us,
      Vanilla Corn!
  - character: DJ
    dialogue: Yo, fool! It's Mixmaster Festus!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So what's Mars Day about, anyway?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: How can you call the Native Martians "stupid"?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That is stupid!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I can't believe you're laughing at the tragic exploitation of a proud,
      bead-loving people.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Lighten up, Leela. It's funny!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Of course it is. But you don't have to laugh!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Amy, no! Not on your parents' planet!
  - character: RJ
    dialogue: Howdy, Amy. Glad to see you've come back to the country. It's where
      the flavour is.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: RJ, this is my boyfriend, Kif.
  - character: RJ
    dialogue: This wimp? You've gone a long way, baby. Cigarette, partner?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh, I don't--
  - character: RJ
    dialogue: I haven't even lit it yet!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh. Is it lit now?
  - character: RJ
    dialogue: Yep.  You're pathetic!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Host-man! Host-woman! I'm having a wonderful time!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Not bad for a city boy, huh?  By the way, I took the liberty of fertilising
      your caviar.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Just relax. I'm sure my parents will love you.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: You don't understand. When I get nervous, I can't control my camouflage
      reflex. Oh, dear!  Oh, goodness! Oh, odds and bodkins!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'll have a thorax and some feelers.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yuck!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Mom? Dad? You remember Kif?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: He's not scrawny, he's just small-boned.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled
      bladders that--
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: I can be manly too. I think I'll, uh, light up a smoke.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: (whispering) Wrong way!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: (wheezy) Smooth!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: 'Look on the bright side: My parents left after you passed out so they
      didn''t even see you barf.'
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh, now they'll never think I'm manly enough to date their daughter.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: It's OK, Kif.  I'll go get you a tissue from your tote.
  - character: RJ
    dialogue: Hey there, Amy. Like you to meet my buddy, Joe.
  - character: JOE
    dialogue: Sorry I'm late. My pool game ran long at the jazz club!
  - character: RJ
    dialogue: Kids love him!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's that weird sound?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Hmm. I might have mental anguish.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I'm OK then.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What happened to the buggalo?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (screaming) Nooo!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Don't worry, Daddy. It'll be OK.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: This sounds like a job for--
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Lieutenant Kif Kroker!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Alright then.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Mom! Dad! Don't ask me to choose!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: They're not your parents, I'm not your sister and that's not your golf
      cart.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Aw!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Everybody just calm down. Kif promised he'd catch the rustlers.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Mrs. Wong, do you have a neckerchief I could borrow?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: My plan is to take all the remaining buggalo and lead them on a rough,
      tough cattle drive. Then, when the rustlers attack, I'll make a citizen's arrest!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: It sounds dangerous. Someone could get killed. Fry, Leela, Bender, I
      want you to go with him.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aw, man!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Wong. I'll get your cattle back or die trying.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: No, Kif! It's too risky. You don't have to do this to prove your manliness.
  - character: RJ
    dialogue: Here are your mounts!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: She's got a fine coat.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Now, we need buggalo to lure the rustlers. How many are left?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You're lookin' at her. Betsy's the only one left. She was curled up
      in my hamper when the storm hit.  Aw, she likes you!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Saddle up, men. We got some no good rustlers to ... catch!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yee-haw!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'Wow, look at that: Olympus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Where?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Right in front of you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh. Oh!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: We'll camp near the top. The rustlers will be sure to spot us there.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Where?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And even thought the computer was off and unplugged, an image stayed
      on the screen. It was ... the Windows logo!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Pfft, that's not scary!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It is if you're a laser printer.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, my turn to tell a ghost story. Once, there was this woman driving--
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hook on the hand!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: OK, I've got one. This family--
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Man in the attic!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fine, Mr. Know-It-All-About-Something-Finally, you tell a story!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: With pleasure. (spookily) Once, not far from here, four people set out
      on a cattle drive--
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (speaking fast) Robot gets bored and kills Fry with a hammer! (normal)
      Sorry, go on.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And then, while they sat helplessly around the campfire ... a demented
      knife-wielding escaped lunatic libertarian zombie mutant snuck up and--
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: (from bushes) Surprise!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Amy? What are you doing here?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I forgot to give you something before you left.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: What?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Is that your camouflage reflex or are you just happy to see me?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: I love it out here, Amy. I feel so manly. I have a blister, I-I spit!
      A-And of course, I tell no one my feelings.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: But you still have them, right?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh, yes. But I keep them inside until I can write them in my diary.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Ah, it's a wonderful night.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: It sure is. I could just lie here beside you staring at the sky all
      night.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I can't!  What's that?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Maybe we just made love.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: The buggalo! They're in the crater.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: The rustlers must have seen me coming and run off, scared.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh, Kif! You're so brave!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: (nervous) Sh! They'll hear us!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: OK, the dynamite's in place.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Are you sure there's no other way to get the buggalo out?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Not unless your parents have thousands of helicopters at their disposal.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Well actually--
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Too late! This is more fun!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Kif! You did it! But how did you know the dynamite would work?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: I once took a seminar in ejecting chickens from a sand dune. The principle
      is essentially the same.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, it's that "barbecue's over" sound again.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) Sandstorm!  We're in the eye of the storm!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Where?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What's that?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: My God!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Who are they?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Also, I didn't know buggalo could fly.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: But your, um, Martian-ness, these buggalo aren't yours. They belong
      to the Wong family.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Uh-huh! Amy Wong.  And you are?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Wait! I'm too rich to be kidnapped!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Amy! Nooo!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Don't worry, Kif. I'm sure some other beautiful, rich girl will fall
      in love with you.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Yes ... but ... I'm afraid I've got some bad news as well.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Um ... well, um ... that is, um...
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: I'll get your daughter back, sir. I swear.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: You mean--? Oh, no, please. I beg you! Oh, for the love of--
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I am the man with no name. Zapp Brannigan, at your service!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Very well. I'll clean up Kif's mess. I shall go bargain with the Martian's
      personally.  Your gasps intrigue me. Explain.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: This mission is incredibly dangerous. Someone's sure to be killed. Fry,
      Leela, Bender--
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Damn you, old man!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Aw, look. Betsy followed you, Kif!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I didn't realise you were bringing your girlfriend, lieutenant!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: She won't leave me alone.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Did I say "girlfriend"? She sounds more like a wife!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: 'Behold: The Great Stone Face of Mars.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hm.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: The only known entrance to the Martian reservation.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What about the Great Stone Ass of Mars?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Well, yeah, but it's way over the other side of the planet.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Nose-ward, ho!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Take me to your leader.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: 'We come to negotiate the release of Amy Wong. And just to clarify:
      Land is the stuff that has sky over it.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: They have such respect for the planet.
  - character: MARTIAN
    dialogue: Cynthia used to drink Slurm.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: How do we even know she's alive?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I'm fine.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Sh! You're weakening our bargaining position. How about instead you
      give us the girl and we carve a bunch of our presidents into your sacred mountain?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, actually you traded it for a bead.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Chief, my people are a people of law. And that law is ...  ... no backsies!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Oh, boy!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Ow, ow, ow, ow! My eye!
  - character: ZOIDBERG

  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Need a lift?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yay, Kif!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Kroker, that was one Brannigan-esque feat of heroism!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Smoke-em?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Ooh, no thanks. I'm on the peace patch.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Well it's just really that I don't feel that--
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Don't be such a chicken, Kif. Teenagers all smoke and they seem pretty
      on the ball.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Yes, sir!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Way to suck it!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Hey, I'm smoking! I'm the greatest! Oh, monkey trumpets!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Well, actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled
      bladders that--
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait. That's the bead you traded your land for?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's a gigantic diamond! That thing must be worth a fortune.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh, Chief, you've made me the happiest girl in the world!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Y'know, if you still want your land, we could just trade back for it.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So we can have the diamond?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But what about your sacred land?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Then Kif flew Betsy, rescued me from the tornado and made peace with
      the Martians.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Please, you give me too little credit.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Captain Brannigan, you're always welcome here at Rancho Zoidberg!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Money doesn't make good people, no siree!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Thanks for saving my life, Kif. You're my hero.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh, you're kind. But your parents still don't like me.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Well globviously! But if they liked you then I wouldn't. Don't you know
      anything about girls?

    dialogue: Oh fuff! What's the point in remembering something? You're just going
      to forget it five seconds later.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) It's so unfair. A debonair robot with a zesty in-your-face

    dialogue: Dearly beloved, we are here today to remember Bender, taken from us
      in the prime of life, when he was crushed by a runaway semi, driven by the Incredible
      Hulk.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aww, you knew my favourite cause of death!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Now let us each remember the best things about Bender in our own way.
      Professor?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Your standard Bending Unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy. But Bender
      was different. Bender has a point-04% nickel impurity.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) It's what made me me.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: If you ever needed a small package brought inot the country without
      a lot of X-raying and such, Bender always had a free body cavity.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Eh, the Professor's was better.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender shush. You're supposed to be dead.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Say more about how great I am. And where's the crying? You people look

      Danny-boy? You really are a massive bonehead.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I'm expressing my sorrow.
  - character: BENDER

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'Yes there is Bender. Bender was a lot of things to a lot of people,
      but looking back, the number one thing I can say about him is this, and simply
      this: Bender was my friend.'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What? That's it? Who are you? You're nobody! This is the worst funeral
      ever! I hope you're all happy. You've succeeded in convincing me life is worth
      living - by showing how bad my funeral will suck.

    dialogue: I thought something looked different in here.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hi, we have a giant stone to deliver - sign here.
  - character: OSIRAN
    dialogue: Ah, very nice. Much like the 10 million other identical stones used
      in the future tomb of our great Pharaoh Hermenthotip.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Impressive, who's building it?
  - character: OSIRAN
    dialogue: You.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Say again?
  - character: OSIRAN
    dialogue: You are now slaves of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip. Guards.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Call it a hunch but, I've got a bad feeling about this.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work but
      they don't pay you or let you go.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's the only thing about being a slave!
  - character: OSIRAN
    dialogue: Attention. You are now possessions of the great Pharaoh Hermethotip,
      heir to the 10th dynasty, bringer of the good aspects of the annual floods.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Incredible. This place is just like the Ancient Egypt of my day.
  - character: OSIRAN
    dialogue: That is no coincidence. For our people visited your Egypt thousands
      of years ago.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'I knew it! Insane theories: one! Regular theories: a billion!'
  - character: OSIRAN
    dialogue: We learned many things from the mighty Egyptians, such as pyramid building,
      space travel and how to prepare our dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Also Wolfman!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Look at these swanky tombs! These people really know how to die!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Are you crazy? They worked thousands of people to death to make these
      stupid monuments.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, you spend you're whole life building a guy's toe and you're gonna
      remember him!  I think I'm gonna like it here!
  - character: OSIRAN
    dialogue: One two three - pull!  One two three - pull!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Pick it up people, we're enslaved here to do a job. Master? Do we have
      to count to three every time? Couldn't we just count to one. Or better yet one
      half?
  - character: OSIRAN
    dialogue: Good idea slave.  One half - pull! One half - pull!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Now we're slavin'!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Come on guy's, Pharaoh's countin' on us. Work faster, like this.  You
      call that motivating me? Don't just whip with your arms. The power comes from
      your hips. Like this.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, quit giving the slave drivers pointers!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, remember who your real friends are.

      you're all hereby -
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (screaming) Nooo!
  - character: HERMENTHOTIP
    dialogue: (hoarse) Tell the slaves they can all go.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Go faster? I told them but they're so damn lazy.
  - character: HERMENTHOTIP
    dialogue: (hoarse) No. I mean they are all free.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Freeloading off you? I agree.
  - character: HERMENTHOTIP
    dialogue: (hoarse) No, I -

  - character: SINGER

      died, Suzie will have joined him in the afterlife -
  - character: OSIRAN
    dialogue: Hermenthotip is gone, the time to designate a new Pharaoh is at hand.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wow!
  - character: OSIRAN
    dialogue: At dawn tomrrow the high priest will consult the Wall Of Prophecy to
      determine Hermenthotip's successor.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Woo!
  - character: OSIRAN
    dialogue: That concludes the funeral. You don't have to go home but you can't
      stay here.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Can you believe it? Pharaoh's dead!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah! Play those bongos!

    dialogue: Citizens of Me! The cruelty of the old Pharaoh is a thing of the past.  Let
      a whole new wave of cruelty wash over this lazy land.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What did he say?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hear the word of Pharaoh. Build unto me a statue of ridiculous proportion.
      One billion cubits in height......that I might be remembered for all eternity.
      And be quick about it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Lowly slave. Why are you not working?

    dialogue: Hmm...its a good start. Uh...yeah it's definately big alright. I just
      wonder if it's too big y'know? I mean, are people gonna be remembering me or
      the statue?

    dialogue: Too exact if you ask me. Tear it down and start again. But this time
      don't embarrass yourselves.

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Did you really think you'd need all this junk in the afterlife?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Afterlife? Pfft. If I thought I had to go through a whole other life
      I'd kill myself right now!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well rot in peace. Fry and I are leaving.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Sorry but we're totally sealed in. Nothing can get in or out. Except
      millions of snakes.  Here, have a pomergranate scnapps from my private distillery
      and start sharing fond memories of me, Bender.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What proof is this? Some huge number?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's explosive! Maybe we could escape by setting fire to the distillery
      and blowing this whole place to rubble! Let's get a little kindling going!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No! You can't blow up my monument, I won't be remembered.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh right, how selfish of me. We'll just stay here forever. Hey Fry,
      remember that robot "Bender"?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bend-er? Doesn't ring a bell.  Did you hear something Leela?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No. But I bet it wasn't someone who was good at stealing.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Stop it stop it! It's not right! You've crossed a line!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey Leela you know who I remember...?

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) I will. I will.  Please, just leave me alone.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, I understand your desire to be remembered. But you don't need
      a statue for that.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) I don't?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No. You have your legacy as a brutal tyrannical dictator. And that will
      outlive any monument.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You really think they'll remember me?
  - character: FRY

    dialogue: Firing torpedo number three!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Huh? What?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's not torpedo three. That's not torpedo three at all.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Damn you Fry and Lee......la!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Help! Mechanical man overboard!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Go after him Leela!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's no use. We were going full speed when we fired him so he's going
      even faster than that.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You mean we can never catch up to him? Not even if we rub the engine
      with cheetah blood?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't know how to say this Fry. But Bender is doomed to drift through
      space...forever.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (solemn) He always wanted to drift forever. But through the American
      Southwest.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm going too fast. I've gotta lose momentum.  Ohh. I'm gonna spend
      eternity alone with barely any swag.  Ooo! Hey universe! Check out the dude
      with the rolex!  Wow! Ostentatious!  Except what good is a candelabra without
      - wait I know!  Ah the pity. Fated to drift forever through the void as gravity's
      plaything. Oh cruel fate, to be thusly boned. Ask not for whom the bone bones.
      It bones for thee. The only thing that keeps me sane is the thought that I have
      all eternity in which to perfect my art.  Ohh!  Damn you!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: There. Now when I'm found in a million years people will know what the
      score was.  Hey what's bombarding me?  Oh no! An asteroid field. If even a pea
      sized asteroid were to whiz through my skull it could -  Ow! Hurt slightly!
      Well that was fun. Now for eons of loneliness.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Huh?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Holy frijoles!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless tragic voyage.
  - character: SHRIMPKINS
    dialogue: (chanting) So hailed!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hmm, those peewees think I'm God huh? Hard to blame 'em!  I am the Metal
      Lord. Who are you?
  - character: MALACHI
    dialogue: I am called Malachi, Lord. It means, um, "He who really loves the Metal
      Lord."
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Listen here Malachi. Time for a religious donation. Hand over your wallet.
  - character: MALACHI
    dialogue: But Lord. We are a poor and simple folk.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Poor? Oh crap.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Eck! Gag unto me with a spoon! Malachi, it's high time I laid down a
      few commandments. You got a chisel? Take this down.  Number one -
  - character: MALACHI
    dialogue: 'Behold: The One Commandment.'
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Make it a double!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Can you find him Professor?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No. I'm afraid the smelloscope isn't powerful enough. Bender's odour
      is so mild it's being overpowered by local sources.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Hooray, people are paying attention to me!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Fry, we brought someone to cheer you up.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: His name is Helper and he's eager to be your new best friend.
  - character: HELPER
    dialogue: Hello there chum. I understand you miss your buddy! Have a pudding pop!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No that's I don't -
  - character: HELPER
    dialogue: Who wants to go to an amusement park?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, I guess that sounds OK.
  - character: HELPER
    dialogue: Have a good time. Hey, I hear your friend Bender is back.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What? Really?
  - character: HELPER
    dialogue: No. I just thought you would enjoy that for a moment.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ooo! Microbrewed! My guys did alright! I think I'll make my countenance
      to shine down upon them!  Malachi, good work. There's no slowing down with the
      Metal Lord tonight.
  - character: MALACHI
    dialogue: Yes, tonight is kind of special.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wait a second. Did you rip off your own arm as a joke?
  - character: MALACHI
    dialogue: Nay. Like most of your followers I was maimed while building the great
      brewery. Others died from the pestelent fumes it spewed forth.  And of course,
      the liquor industry attracted organised crime.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aw, it's all my fault. Malachi, tell thy people that the Lord is moved
      by their plight.
  - character: MALACHI
    dialogue: Save him! Save my son oh Metal Lord!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: This looks like a job for God!  What the? Malachi, what manner of deal
      is this with the chanting?
  - character: MALACHI
    dialogue: They saw you save my son. Now everyone is praying for their own miracles.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Very well. What do they want?
  - character: MALACHI
    dialogue: The people of that village pray for wealth.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Um, that was a practice miracle. Who's next?
  - character: MALACHI
    dialogue: The farmers pray for sunlight so that their barley might make a more
      refreshing beer for today's God on the go.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Very well. Let there be light.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I got it I got it!  Um, when you're writing the Bible, you might want
      to omit that last miracle.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: He decided not to let go.  I can't believe you're gone. I won't! If
      I can't reach you physically, I'll just have to try something desperately crazy!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So that's my story Father Changstein el Gamahl. Is there anything religion
      can do to help me find my friend?
  - character: PRIEST
    dialogue: Well, we could join together in prayer.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh-huh but is there anything useful we can do?
  - character: PRIEST
    dialogue: No.
  - character: GYPSY
    dialogue: "Sure I hold s\xE9ance, channel your friend no problem. Insert coin.\
      \  I am your friend...Bonder."
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bonder? Is it really you?
  - character: GYPSY
    dialogue: Yes. I am fine. Give the gypsy $10.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait a minute. Bender's name isn't Bonder, it's Bender. You're a fraud!
  - character: GYPSY
    dialogue: Look, you want false hope or not?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Only if you don't have any real hope.
  - character: GYPSY
    dialogue: Well, there is perhaps one way. Have you heard of the Monks Of The Shubah?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I've not heard of them.
  - character: GYPSY
    dialogue: They are an ancient order who believe God exists in the depths of space.
      They have built the universe's most powerful radio telescope, high in the Himalayas,
      to search for him.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You think they'd let me use it to look for Bender?
  - character: GYPSY
    dialogue: What am I psychic? I mean yes! Yes, I'm sure they will. Yes.
  - character: MALACHI
    dialogue: Oh Metal Lord, hear my prayer.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (irrate) Yes Malachi what is it this time?
  - character: MALACHI
    dialogue: My Lord, the infidels on your back no longer believe in you. They say
      their prayers go unheeded.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Of course they're unheeded how am I supposed to hear prayers coming
      out of my ass?
  - character: MALACHI
    dialogue: They talk of war against the faithful. I beseech thee. Rise up against
      them, smite someone who deserves it for once.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Malachi, every time I interfere I only make things worse. You're best
      off solving your own problems.
  - character: MALACHI
    dialogue: But, but Metal Lord.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What part of "nay" doesn't thou understand?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sir, I'm outfitting an expedition to a monestary high in the Himalayas.
      I'll need a long sleeved coat.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look, I miss Bender almost half as much as you do but you can't bring
      him back this way. It's hopeless.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You can't give up hope just because it's hopeless. You gotta hope even
      more and cover your ears and go "blah blah blah blah blah blah blah!"  (shouting)
      I'd also like a pack mule.
  - character: SALESMAN
    dialogue: (shouting) At once sir!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, you obviously won't listen to reason, so I guess I'll listen to
      idioticness and come with you. But we'll need a Sherpa to guide us.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Now that's one Bible that doesn't disappoint on every page! Looks like
      my society's running pretty well without my meddling - huh?  Atomic bombs? Oh
      no! Those unbelievers from my backside must have found my nuclear pile!
  - character: MALACHI
    dialogue: Fear not my Lord, we shall be with you soon.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You're with me now. This is the maximum level of being with me!
  - character: MALACHI
    dialogue: We will solve our own problems as you commanded. The time has come to
      convert the unbelievers.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Convert them?
  - character: MALACHI
    dialogue: To radioactive vapour!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) No!  (laughing) Ooo it tickles!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hello? Is anyone still alive? How about in the porno theatre?  Don't
      be embarrassed. (crying) They're dead. All dead. Who would have known playing
      God could have such terrible consequences?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) Fry, if I drop dead from exhaustion make sure my body freezes
      in a dignified position. None of that huddled over for warmth crap.
  - character: SHERPA
    dialogue: Behold. The Monastery Of The Shubah. I must leave you now for I am not
      holy enough to enter.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: OK.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Looks rickety. We'd better test it.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, that galaxy's signalling in binary! I gotta signal back! But I
      only know enough binary to as where the bathroom is. (shouting) You speak English?
  - character: GALAXY
    dialogue: I do now.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What are you some kind of galactic computer?
  - character: GALAXY
    dialogue: Possible. I am user friendly. My good chum.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Who built you?
  - character: GALAXY
    dialogue: I have always been.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh my God. Are you God?
  - character: GOD
    dialogue: Possible. I do feel compasson for all living things. My good chum.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But why would God think in binary? Unless...you're not God, but the
      remains of a computerised space probe that collided with God.
  - character: GOD
    dialogue: That seems probable.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: How long have you been at it?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And then what?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Sort of like a giant kareoke machine?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Not really.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hmm, finding God, that - that's important, yeah. But you know what might
      be a treat for everyone? If you let me use the telescope to find my lost friend
      Bender.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aw c'mon, you guys have forever to look for God. All I'm asking is one
      measley lifetime to find my friend.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That telescope is as much mine as it is anybody's. I'm using it whether
      you give me permission or not.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Heyya! You're order may be famous for it's martial arts. But I've never
      met a holy man I couldn't clobber.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh. Then get in the laundry room or I'll kick your butts!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So, do you know what I'm gonna do before I do it?
  - character: GOD
    dialogue: Yes.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What if I do something different?
  - character: GOD
    dialogue: Then I don't know that.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Cool cool! I bet a lot of people pray to you huh?
  - character: GOD
    dialogue: Yes, but there are so many asking so much. After a while you just sorta
      tune it out.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Y'know, I was God once.
  - character: GOD
    dialogue: Yes I saw. You were doing well until everyone died.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It was awful. I tried helping them. I tried not helping them but in
      the end I couldn't do them any good. Do you think what I did was wrong?
  - character: GOD
    dialogue: Right and wrong are just words. What matters is what you do.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah I know, that's why I asked if what I did - forget it.
  - character: GOD
    dialogue: Bender, being God isn't easy, if you do too much, people get dependent.
      And if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch, like a
      safecracker or a pickpocket.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Or a guy who burns down the bar for the insurance money.
  - character: GOD
    dialogue: Yes, if you make it look like an electrical thing. When you do things
      right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Does that mean you wouldn't send me back to Earth even if I prayed to
      you?
  - character: GOD
    dialogue: Earth? Which way is that?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (sadly) I don't know.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender? Bender?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hello? Has anyone out there seen Bender?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, it's been three days. And even if you stay here the rest of your
      life, there is virtually no chance of finding him. It's time to give up.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (sadly) You're right. I'm never gonna see him again. I know he was evil
      and on more than one occasion he, he actually stole my blood.  But still, I
      wish I had Bender back.
  - character: GOD
    dialogue: Huh?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Huh? Wha? You say something?
  - character: GOD
    dialogue: No, no. Well so long. Remember what we talked about.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hot hot hot hot!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender! It's a miracle!  Ow!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This is by a wide margin the least likely thing that has ever happened.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Guys, you'll never believe what happened. First I was God then I met
      God!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We climbed a mountain and locked up some monks.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh no the monks. We forgot to let them out of the laundry room.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Do we have to? I mean they're monks. I'm sure their God will let them
      out or at least give them more shoes to eat.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fat chance. You can't count on God for jack. He pretty much told me
      so himself. Now come on. If we don't save those monks no one will!
  - character: GOD
    dialogue: When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything
      at all.

      I don't recognise any of you, nor can I recall why I am here. Now without further
      ado, a film highlighting Planet Express Inc.'s latest fiscal year.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I'll not only help you find it, I'll help you do more to it!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ooo, a bot-mitzvah. Shalom hunger, shalom free food!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: That is so unfair!
  - character: PIG
    dialogue: Tell me about it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So what's the deal? You guys don't believe in Robot Jesus?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: It's been a terrible year people. The company is on the verge of bankruptcy.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But the movie -
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Was a substantial loss for the company. The blue slice represent s the
      money we earned from shipping packages while the green slice represents an $8
      bank error in our favour.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This toads the wet sprocket. What about our thousands of shares of stock?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Worthless.
  - character: HATTIE
    dialogue: 'I own one share of Planet kajiggers so I''m entitled to some answers.
      Question 1: Why does no one visit me in my home?'
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: '''Cause your apartment smells like Polygrip and cat pee.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This is perfect for me.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: 'Question: Do you have to have been cryogenically frozen to get the
      free -  You didn''t let me finish. I was going to say "to get the free food."'

    dialogue: My name's Joe and I'm a defrostee.

  - character: JOE
    dialogue: When I was frozen giant carrots ruled the Earth. But now they don't.
      It takes some getting used to.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Boneitis? Pft! That's a funny name for a horrible disease.
  - character: CAVEMAN
    dialogue: As a caveman frozen in a glacier I face different challenges. (crying)
      The hardest thign was seeing my wife on display in the British Museum.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Y'know that dance wasn't as safe as they said it was.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No question.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: They're scared of our raw power. Oh but if you want a job, I could beg
      everyone at the company where I work.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: And finally, the post office meter is for business mail only.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aw come on! I got a lot of ransom notes to send!
  - character: HATTIE
    dialogue: Enough talk. It's time for action. I move that everyone come to my apartment
      to snuggle my cat.
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: Second.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I move that your cat stinks and is ugly.
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: Second.
  - character: HATTIE
    dialogue: I move that we vote on a new Chief Executive Officer and oust this old
      creep. And also that make cat smells good and is pretty.
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: Second.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Very well. I nominate the Professor.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Second.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Second.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Second.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I'm your man.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I vote my 10,000 shares for the Professor.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Yeah the Professor!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Me!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I nominate That Guy. Not just because he has a suit but because he knows
      about business and stuff and he has a tie. My shares still count if they went
      through the washing machine right?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Well, if I know anything about which number is bigger than the other
      number, I'd say that -
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: Hold on there. Scruffy votes his 40,000 shares for the mysterious stranger.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 40,000? How come you have four times as much stock as the rest of us?
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: Scruffy believes in this company.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Then we have a tie. And in the event of a tie the Professor, as the
      current CEO remains -
  - character: HATTIE
    dialogue: I demand the floor. I may only have one share but I get to vote same
      as anyone. And I'm voting against the cat hater.  Isn't that right kitty?  Hey!
      You ate my change!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Then it's settled. The new chief executive officer of Planet Express
      corporation is That Guy.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Please welcome our new chief executive officer, That Guy.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Uh excuse me? Which is the one people like to hug?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I'll ruin you like I ruined this company.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Uh, um, uh business plan, uh, yes. I keep it here - right next to my
      heart.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: So long suckers!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm rollin' up the corporate ramp.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ohh!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: It's the end of the line!

    dialogue: We're ruined!
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: What fevered dream is this that bids to tear this company in twain?
  - character: MONSTER
    dialogue: Thank you come again!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No thanks I make my own.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Is it Planet Express master?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big, and evil. Ours is small
      and neutral.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Look, everyone wants to be like Germany but do we really have the pure
      strength of will?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Yes my liege!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No we're not. And as vice chairman, I believe I speak for the entire
      board when I issue this challenge to Mom. Look at my butt!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: You call that a pressed ham? Walt, hit the retaliate button.
  - character: WALT
    dialogue: Uh, um, hmm lets see.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Any button they all retaliate!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Woo yeah! Hit him hit him hit him! Now this is the high life! Watching
      apes mangle each other near celebrities!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Get your stinkin' trike off me you damn dirty ape.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, work really really hard?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh thank God!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This company's on the fast track to the It List! Blast back kudos all
      around!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh hello? We haven't made one delivery since you two took over.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That was terrible! People won't even know what we do.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I don't even know what we do. Nah just kidding, what are like a bus
      or something?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Did you approve that awful ad Fry?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yes I did Leels! And I'll tell you why. Because it grows the brand.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh Lord!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: This company's circling the drain I tell you. I'd sell my stock right
      now for a sangwich!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: A complete sangwich?  You got fleeced! I would have settled for a hard
      roll with ketchup inside!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: What is this moose drip?  The new delivery kings? I'm sick of hearing
      about those turtle squirts!

    dialogue: Fry we're worried about Planet Express.

    dialogue: That Guy is nothing but a flashy con man! And you've been hypnotised
      by his swinging blogney!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You've changed Fry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What? I haven't changed.  Suz? Have I changed?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Thanks doll.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't care what Ms Johnson says, Thst Guy's turning this place into
      some kind of...business.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: This isn't a business, I've always thought of it as more of a source
      of cheap labour. Like a family.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You're right Professor. We might not be a traditional family like the
      Murphy's next door or the lesbian coven across the street but we are a family,
      and That Guy understands that.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh no.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: How?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh Ms Johnson? Please bring in some more chair fuel.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I had no idea the company would be sold. I was just an innocent suck
      up. You've gotta believe me!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Just leave us alone and let us clear out our lockers.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah.
  - character: LACKEY
    dialogue: You have Mrs Darlinghaven's cotillion at 7 ma'am.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ms Johnson, you've never lied to me. Am I still a good person?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I've got to redeem myself. Somehow, sometime, for some reason. I'll
      block this takeover!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Believe it or not, I have more important things to do today than laugh
      and clap my hands.  Reschedule.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You suck!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: According to regulations, both companies must approve the takeover.
      Planet Express shareholders, cast your votes.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Great Bonda of Uganda! We can vote against it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'll vote it down like a raise for school teachers!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What the?
  - character: HATTIE
    dialogue: How the?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh no.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: The shares were worthless and he kept asking for toilet paper.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: And now if Momcorp shareholders will cast their ballots.
  - character: IGNER
    dialogue: Um...uh... Uh, the ballot was confusing.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: How about a hand recount?
  - character: IGNER
    dialogue: OK.  Ow!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: The takeover of Planet Express is approved.

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: He's dead.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Pry out his fillings, feed him to the jackals and lets get on with the
      sale.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't think so. 'Cause as vice chairman of the company I gain voting
      control of his shares.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Don't be a fool you idiot!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'll be whatever I wanna do! That Guy was the greatest businessman that
      ever lived and before his mysterious death he taught me everything he knew.  But
      some things I had to learn myself. I learned that money is fine but in the end
      what counts is people... ...People you love... ...You can't put a price on that...
      So I'm giving up control of the company... ...to a man of enourmous experience...
      ...Professor... ...Hubert Farnsworth.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh uh what? I'm awake, I'm awake!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fry, stop doing the right thing you jerk!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Let Mom buy the company! We all wanna be filthy stinking rich!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Trust me two out of three doesn't cut it!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You mean you'd rather be rich than work together?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hell yeah!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: In my whole life this company was the only place I ever really felt
      at home. If being millionaires is more important to you than our...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It is!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: '...friendship, then I''ll sell Planet Express, for you.'
  - character: HATTIE
    dialogue: Millionaires nothing! The stock's only worth three kajiggers!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh come on!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: My Jah! It's worth less now than when it was worthless!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It is? Yahoo! We're poor no matter what I do! The deal is off!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Aha! Once again the conservative sangwich-heavy portfolio pays off for
      the hungry investor! Oh! I'm ruined.  Why? Why?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look, so we're not millionaires. At least we all still get to work together!

    dialogue: Oh put down the binoculars Fry. The wall of that strip club isn't going
      to collapse twice in one day.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I know, and I've grown to accept that. Now I'm more interested in that
      new pizza parlour across the street. Kinda makes me pine for my days as a pizza
      delivery boy. "Here's you pizza," I'd say. "I didn't order any," they'd say.
      And then I'd be off to my next adventure.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That story stunk. Hand me the binoculars. I think the owner is from
      Cygnus 5.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Cygnoids? On our block? Flying foo! They should go back where they came
      from.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Professor please. Society's never gonna make any progress until we all
      learn to pretend to like each other. Now lets go over there and make these hideous
      strangers feel welcome.

    dialogue: No, actually I did mean to offend a little. This is awful.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey hey, what's wrong? Was it something Leela said?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aww, don't cry foreign people. I used to work in a pizzeria and as soon
      as I stop hallucinating and blasting puke, I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza
      - Earth style!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'For starters, only use quality ingredients. Case in point: No more
      live bees.  Oregano works equally well. And when you put pizzas in the oven,
      don''t get in with them.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Most important of all is the big screen TV. Human families need a TV
      when they're eating so they don't have to talk to each other.  Ah, the Earthican
      pasttime, blernsball!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well if you're going to be Earthicans we'll have to teach you. How about
      your pizzeria plays a game against Planet Express? Oh but you'll need nine players.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (shouting) Go team! Beat those no good Cygnoids! Show them they stink
      at a game they've never played before!
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: Hit by a pitch, take your base.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) Sorry about that, I guess I needed a few more warm-up pitches.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No batter! No batter!  No batter anymore.
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: Take your base.
  - character: LEELA

    dialogue: Check out the one eyed bean machine!

    dialogue: Excuse me, I'd like to talk to you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Am I under arrest?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wait I know you. You're the sleabag who owns the Ultimate Robot Fighting
      League.
  - character: COMMISSIONER
    dialogue: Not anymore. Now I'm the sleazebag who owns the New New York Mets.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: The Mets? Those bums are worse than me.
  - character: COMMISSIONER
    dialogue: Close to it. But they don't draw a crowd like you. Which is why I wanna
      sign you to the team.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You mean I'd be the first woman ever to play major league blernsball?
  - character: COMMISSIONER
    dialogue: Well yeah but basically you'd just be a publicity stunt. I figured a
      one-eyed lady skull buster might bring out the freakshow crowd.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wow, the first woman ever to play major league blernsball.
  - character: COMMISSIONER
    dialogue: Again yeah, but basically you'd -
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yippee!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Ta-da! The first woman ever to play major league blernsball. How do
      I look?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Like a sexy Yogi Berra!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Why is your number seven-eight's?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: All the whole numbers have been retired.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow, I must say I'm impressed. You look just like a ball player. Can
      I pat you on the butt?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry I'm a professional athlete! So go ahead.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ohh, now I'm too nervous.
  - character: UECKER
    dialogue: Well folks it's only the fifth inning but the Swedes have already turned
      this one into a laffer. And that's with two F's. The crowd is pouring out of
      the stadium LA style.
  - character: COMMISSIONER
    dialogue: Skipper, we're losing the crowd. Put it our new novelty act - Leela.
  - character: SKIPPER
    dialogue: Darn it! I already put in the circus clown.
  - character: COMMISSIONER

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Bullseye!
  - character: UECKER
    dialogue: (voice-over) Ooo! An inauspicious start for the career of the first
      woman blernsballer. An inauspicious continuation for the career of the first
      woman blernsballer.
  - character: CROWD
    dialogue: (chanting) Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean...
  - character: UECKER
    dialogue: Ouch! It's a three bean-ball salad. The Mets fans love it though and
      who can blame them? They haven't had much to cheer about this year -
  - character: COMMISSIONER
    dialogue: Kid that was great! You got us more publicity than a cowboy in a shark
      tank. Poor Tex, he was quite a shark.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oop! Sorry.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, how did you get in here?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Since when are you my agent?
  - character: BENDER

      How much...? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass...!
      Deal!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender that's great! How much did you get me?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (impressed) One hundred dollars.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (reading) As a pitcher, I serve up plenty of bean-balls, so I know good
      beans when I see them. Bean-Bay Beans - they're the beaniest!
  - character: DIRECTOR

  - character: UECKER

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You're the best babe!  Hang on call comin' in.  What's that...? Hey
      you put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass...! Deal!
  - character: LEELA

    dialogue: (impressed) A thousand and one pesos!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yo soy muy malo en lanzar, pero yo soy muy bueno en comer frijoles.
      Come los Bean Bay frijoles, los frijoles de los reyes.
  - character: DIRECTOR
    dialogue: Cut! OK, now do one with bean suit on!
  - character: GIRL
    dialogue: When I grow up I want to injure men by throwing stuff at them just like
      you Leela! Will you sign my magazine?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Aww, sure thing sweetie. Who should I make it out to?
  - character: GIRL
    dialogue: Well, uh...to eBay?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's a popular name today. Little "e" big "B"?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Five bucks an autograph, 200 fans. Add a one and two zeros in front
      of that and we got ourselves a wad!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm not doing this for the wad. I'm doing it for all the struggling
      female athletes who need a role model.
  - character: WOMAN
    dialogue: Yeah, a role model in how to stink!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What? Who are you?
  - character: WOMAN
    dialogue: Jackie Anderson. I'm on the blernsball team at NNYU and I was hoping
      to get to play in the majors soon.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, following in my footsteps?
  - character: JACKIE
    dialogue: Pft, God forbid! Your little freakshow is making it impossible for real
      female ball players to be taken seriously. I hope you're proud of yourself.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Alright shows over no refunds, you heard the robot get out!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm a fool. The fans haven't been cheering for me, they've been cheering
      at me.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Don't be upset Leela. You, um...you look really cute in your uniform.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (crying) That's what makes it so sad. I thought I was doing something
      heroic.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You are. What about that little girl you visited in the hospital? You
      know the one I mean? The one who died?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You're right. I can't let people down anymore. As God as my witness,
      I vow to earn the respect of girls and women everywhere. I will become the best
      blernsball player of all time.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: That's statistically impossible. In 77 innings you haven't gotten a
      single out. At this rate, you're sure to go down as the worst blernsball player
      of all time.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh. Then I have a new vow. I solemnly swear that I will become not the
      worst blernsball player of all time.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey look! The player's who broke the various colour barriers!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: When will Man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Ah, here we are - the worst player in history. If I can be just a little
      better than him I can slink away with my head held high.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It says he once struck out when his tongue got stuck to an unusually
      cold bat.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And here he is trying to make a catch with an oven mit.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's even a crummy hologram.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hank Aaron XXIV? How could you play so blowfully? The original Hank
      Aaron was great!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Neat!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So Hank - the bad Hank, just how blowful were you?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela could beat that. She's pitched her whole career without getting
      an out.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look, I don't wanna be in this exhibit. That's why I need your help
      - so I can be one tiny iota less pathetic than you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: One thing she can do is lodge a ball in the depth centre of your brain.
      You better get a batting helmet.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (quietly) Alright, low and away!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You mean "keep your eye on the ball"?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (whispering) Psst, you're holding the bat upside down.

  - character: UECKER
    dialogue: Well fans Boston's turning the last game into a real squeeeker! And
      that's with three "e's"! Two men on and they're down to their last out.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Come on skipper, it's my last chance to prove I'm not the worst player
      ever. Please put me in.
  - character: SKIPPER
    dialogue: No. We're actually winning this game. You only go in as a joke when
      we're eight runs behind. Or when our other pitchers sneak out early to beat
      the traffic.  (shouting) Come on! Lets see some fundamentals out there!  And
      not clown fundamentals.
  - character: SKIPPER
    dialogue: Aw, darn, darn it! Now the bases are loaded. Isn't there a man on this
      team who can get one more out?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I can.
  - character: SKIPPER
    dialogue: 'I repeat: Isn''t there a man on this team on this -'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I've been training with Hank Aaron.

    dialogue: You've been training with the Hank Aaron?
  - character: LEELA

      you before!

  - character: UECKER
    dialogue: Would you look at that! College blernsball's finest female hitter making
      her big league debut against pro-ball's worst female anything! I've never seen
      anything this bizzare - and I've seen Mr Belvendere naked! Woo!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (quietly) Keep cool, she's just like any other player. She puts on her
      sports bra one arm at a time.

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Strike one - a personal best!
  - character: UMPIRE
    dialogue: Strike two!
  - character: UECKER
    dialogue: A grand slam blern. The Mets lose, their season is over! And no question,
      Leela - the first woman ever to reach the majors will go down as the single
      worst player in the history of blernsball...!
  - character: UECKER
    dialogue: (voice-over) ...And yet tonight we have witnessed the beginning of a
      great career for the first woman to play the sport well - Jackie Anderson!
  - character: JACKIE
    dialogue: Leela?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Jackie. I guess you were right, I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry.
  - character: JACKIE
    dialogue: No, don't be. It turns out you were an inspiration afterall.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (crying) I was?
  - character: JACKIE
    dialogue: Uh-huh. You were so awful that women everywhere set out to prove that
      they don't stink as bad as you. You know, like a pig or something.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, that's so kind of you. I guess I made a difference afterall!

    dialogue: In that case brunch is served! Let's go, move it out, stop crying Leela!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Zoidberg, are you coming?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Sure. Me.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Because I don't want you touching that thing.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I know that.  Surrender your mysteries to Zoidberg!  Oh no! Professor
      will hit me. But if Zoidberg fixes it, then perhaps gifts!  Ow, what? Ohh!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Today, I've personalised each of your meals. For example, Amy, you're
      cute, so I baked you a pony.  Come on! Eat! I slaved all day over a filthy stove!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: This is terrible!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good thing I secretly installed this wormhole in the table!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Where does the other end come out?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You know I'm not quite sure.  Oh dear me!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: The pie is ready. You guys like swarms of things right?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Casual hello, it's me Zoidberg, act naturally.  Ow! Ouch! Get off of
      me! Stop!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: How interesting Dr Zoidberg. Do go on.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey check out the palm tree! It only gets sick when I cook brunch! How's
      that for a coincidence Professor? With all your precious science!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: '...but this food actually tastes better as vomit!'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's unbearable! How much do you think it would cost to get my tongue
      removed?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) And this time I mean it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aw, who am I kidding? It was stupid of me to ever dream of becoming
      a chef. I don't have what it takes and nothing can change that.  Then it's settled!
      Elzar will teach me to cook!
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Absolutely not.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But I watch your show. You owe me!
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: I owe you nothing! For starter's your antenna's in my crotch. Also I
      hate you. Finally, you can't cook for squat.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What was the first one again?
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: I hate you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I thought that was number two.
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: I knocked it up a notch. Bam!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Aw, I'll never recombobulate this ship! When the Professor finds out,
      he'll tear me a new cloaca!  Wait! What would the robot do?  Frame someone.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What up?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (singing) I'm walking on sunshine! La la la la sunshine!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) It's over! My dream of being a chef is deadder than the cat
      I'm sitting on!
  - character: HOBO
    dialogue: Gus old chum, let's give a friendly welcome to this new robo.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What did you call me?
  - character: GUS
    dialogue: A robo. You know? A robot-hobo.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh OK I thought you said "romo."
  - character: HOBO
    dialogue: No offence intended my filthy friend. In fact, why not join us and ride
      the space rails?
  - character: GUS
    dialogue: Get ready. We's gonna jump off at that switching prism up ahead.
  - character: HOBO
    dialogue: We're going nearly the speed of light so uh, roll when you land.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ow.
  - character: GUS
    dialogue: Welcome to Bumbase Alpha, the biggest hobo jungle in the quadrant.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I've seen bigger. Oh wait I'm thinking of Eugene Oregon.  Wait. A pie
      with hobo-lifting aroma? Who baked it?
  - character: GUS
    dialogue: Helmut Spargle. He used to be the greatest chef.
  - character: HOBO
    dialogue: His restaurant was so high toned, the only way to get reservations was
      to create a parallel universe where you already had reservations.
  - character: GUS
    dialogue: Yep. I once ate there back when I what was a senator.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yo Spargle, if you're such a great cook, how'd you end up in this dump?
  - character: SPARGLE
    dialogue: Ages ago I was the host of a TV show...
  - character: SPARGLE
    dialogue: (voice-over) ...Down Home Country Kitchen Mit Helmut Spargle. But one
      day the extreme soda company that sponsored the show decided it was too old
      fashioned.
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: Spargle, you're fired! We need a chef who can attract today's younger
      extreme cooking show viewer.
  - character: SPARGLE
    dialogue: Elzar!
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Get lost old man! Bam!
  - character: SPARGLE
    dialogue: "Mein souffl\xE9!"
  - character: SPARGLE
    dialogue: Elzar had been seduced by the dark side of cooking. Cilantro, mango
      slasa, raspberry vinaigrette!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That twizzler!
  - character: SPARGLE
    dialogue: As for me, I went temporarily insane and vound up here - making pies
      out of shoes.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: My story's a lot like yours only more interesting 'cause it involves
      robots. That jerk Elzar ruined my dream of being a chef too.
  - character: SPARGLE
    dialogue: Interesting. You wish to become a cook, but as a robot you have no sense
      of taste.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's so unfair! I have eight other senses but I'd trade them all, even
      smission, to be able to taste.
  - character: SPARGLE
    dialogue: You don't understand. Without the distraction of taste, your mind is
      free to touch the Zen of pure flavour. You could become the greatest chef ever.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I could?
  - character: SPARGLE
    dialogue: Yes. Just as Beethoven was a great composer because he was deaf!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Or like how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands!
  - character: SPARGLE
    dialogue: Bender, hear me well, I shall train you. But first you must forget everything
      you know about cooking.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Done.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That's right Ricardo, a ship in a bottle...! What's that...? Well hang
      on, I'll look.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I've gathered you all here in the accusing parlour because one of you
      is a miniature ship wrecker!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I'm acting astonished.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Certain clues suggest the culprit is none other than our own...Philip
      J. Fry!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What?!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh it was a brilliant scheme but you made one fatal mistake...leaving
      this confession note.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Fry you scoundrel!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, I don't remember any of that but I don't have the wherewithal
      to defend myself.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Then I have no choice but to charge you the full cost of the materials.
      $10.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: There you go.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (shouting) What have I done?!
  - character: SPARGLE
    dialogue: Your training is complete, little dessert spoon. Now, just as the man
      who wishes to be world chess champion must win at least one game of chess so
      must you serve at least one edible meal. (whispering) Succeed and I shall reveal
      to you the age old secret (whispering more) of perfect flavour.
  - character: GUS
    dialogue: Ooh yeah!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Slop's on!
  - character: GUS
    dialogue: Fine lookin' eats!
  - character: SPARGLE
    dialogue: It is...acceptable.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at! Wait. Why'd you stop eating master?
  - character: SPARGLE
    dialogue: (hoarse) Because...my stomach is about to explode.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What? My dinner killed you? Oh man!
  - character: SPARGLE
    dialogue: (hoarse) Oh it hurts. But don't lose confidence. The important thing
      is that you defeat Elzar after I am gone.  And using this, you cannot fail.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: A diamond vial of Mrs Dash?
  - character: SPARGLE
    dialogue: (hoarse) No, it is the essence of pure flavour. A few drops will cause
      the inner perfection of any dinner to blossom forth.  Oh! There goes my...life.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'll avenge you master. I swear, in the presence of these drunken bums,
      that I shall defeat Elzar!
  - character: GUS
    dialogue: Oh I'm not drunk, I'm mentally ill! But I like what what you said!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Elzar, I'm a walking pile of your unfinished business!
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Why you -
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Helmut Spargle has a message for you. He says (hoarse) "Ooo, I'm dead!"
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Spargle huh? What he do, bland himself to death?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No. He was eating some food I made and by a crazy coincidence his stomach
      exploded. Now I'm here to avenge him.
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: OK but it seems like you're the one who killed him.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Maybe so but you are his sworn enemy. I challenge you to a battle of
      the chefs.
  - character: CUSTOMER
    dialogue: Scandalous!
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Very well. We'll meet on the ancient televised battleground of Kitchen
      Coliseum! Whosever meal is best will claim the title of Iron Cook.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Iron Cook eh? I can't lose. I'm 30% iron!  You're going down! Uh, also
      I had a reservation for one, under "Dr Bender."
  - character: HIROKI
    dialogue: Please welcome the superintendant of Kitchen Coliseum...Chairman Koji!  No
      robot chef has ever competed here but today one has barged his way in to challege
      for the title of...
  - character: KOJI
    dialogue: '...Iron Cookuru!'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) Yeah you show 'em!
  - character: HIROKI
    dialogue: 'Let''s meet today''s celebrity judges: Captain of the Harlem Globetrotters,
      Ethan Bubblegum Tate!'
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Konnichiwa brother!
  - character: HIROKI
    dialogue: TV anchor-monster Morbo!
  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: Greetings pathetic host!
  - character: HIROKI
    dialogue: And a woman who ended a thousand year war with her apple dandies, Martha
      Stewart's head!
  - character: STEWART
    dialogue: The secret is fresh pork.
  - character: HIROKI
    dialogue: And now, chairman Koji will present the theme ingredient to be used
      in every dish today.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: "(quietly) If it's chicken: chicken \xE0 la king. If it's fish: fish\
      \ \xE0 la king. If it's turkey: fish \xE0 la king!"
  - character: KOJI
    dialogue: Soylent Greuu!
  - character: HIROKI
    dialogue: Soylent Green, a classic ingredient of gourment cooking. And the battle
      is on.  Aki, what's Elzar making?
  - character: AKI
    dialogue: Well Hiroki-san, when I asked him he asked what business it was of mine
      and conjectured that my mother was a prostitute.
  - character: STEWART
    dialogue: In the English countryside many prostitutes decorate their rooms with
      festive gourds.
  - character: HIROKI
    dialogue: Look at Bender roll that dough!
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: I've never seen such confident, powerful strokes of the ass!
  - character: STEWART
    dialogue: You've never seen mine!
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: (sexfully) No I haven't!
  - character: HIROKI
    dialogue: The iron cook is bringing in his signature creation, a working pastry
      replica of downtown Venice.]
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: Commemorative turkey basters, get your commemorative turkey basters.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yo, hook me up. My turkey is dry and I've tried everything.  Oh right.
      Never mind.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Oh the guilt! The unbearable guilt!
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Bam!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Master Spargle. If you can hear me up there in that ditch where I left
      you, this is for you.
  - character: KOJI
    dialogue: Time, uperuu!
  - character: HIROKI
    dialogue: The iron cook Neptunian has gone all out to please the judges. He's
      even garnished the salad with $100 bills. Let's see what they think.
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: Mmm, soylent green is my kind of people!
  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: Scrumptious. Morbo will store this in his sack for future digestion.
  - character: STEWART
    dialogue: I'm swimming in my own soylent waste. It's a good thing.
  - character: HIROKI
    dialogue: Next, up, challenger Bender. A student of the legendary Hemut Spargle,
      Bender is some sort of wonderful mechanical man.
  - character: STEWART
    dialogue: Ooo...delicious!
  - character: TATE
    dialogue: This food looks kind of funky, but it tastes kind of funkay!
  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: The challenger's ugly food has shown us that even hideous things can
      be sweet on the inside.
  - character: HIROKI
    dialogue: And now, judgement. The winner will become the new iron cook, the loser
      is doomed to scrub.  Who's confection achieves perfection? Who's foodstuff will
      be the good stuff?
  - character: KOJI
    dialogue: Challengeruu Benderuu!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yay!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That's my robot! I own him!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You honour me chairman Koji.
  - character: KOJI
    dialogue: Domo arigato, Mr Roboto.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Chairman-san, I came here with one goal. To humiliate Elzar in a large
      stadium. I believe I'e done that.
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: No question.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But the true Zen of flavour is not found in a coliseum. It is found
      in a small kitchen, with friends. That is why I decline the title of Iron Cook
      and accept only the lesser title of Zinc Saucier which I just made up. Also
      it comes with double prize money.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Wait! Everyone must know. I broke the Professor's bottled ship.  And
      what is worse, I framed my dearest friend Fry! (crying) I can never repay him
      his ten dollars. So I must take the only honourable path. what the killing myself.  Here
      I go already.  Huh?
  - character: KOJI
    dialogue: Oh! That sword cost 5000 dolluu!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Fry did it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And that's how I defeated Elzar - thanks to Spargle's magic liquid.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yes, we were there. And we just finished watching it on TV.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Hmm. Let me see that vial Bender.  Good Lord! According to the spectrolizer,
      Spargle's magic ingredient was...water. Ordinary water!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: No!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ah, so the real gift Spargle gave you was confidence. The confidence
      to be your best.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes, ordinary water. Laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of
      LSD.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: The important thing is, by my standards, I won fair and square. Now,
      who wants brunch? Cooked with plenty of..."confidence"?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm in!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I do!

    dialogue: (voice-over) Shatner's log, airdate ... unknown.
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: The impossible has happened. It would take days to recount the events
      I have witnessed. So, settle in. It all began--
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Quiet, you! This court martial is now in session. The honourably sexy
      Zapp Brannigan residing. Bring in the accused.
  - character: TAKEI
    dialogue: Oh, my!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Philip J. Fry, you stand accused of travelling to the forbidden planet
      Omega 3, a crime punishable by 12 concurrent death sentences. Do you understand
      the charges?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: One beep for "yes", two beeps for "no".
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: '"Yes". So noted. Do you plead guilty? Double "yes". Guilty! I will
      now carry out the punishment. Kif, my gun.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wait! He plead not guilty.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Order!  Order in the court! Very well then, Mr. Fry. Please recount
      the events that led you to be guilty.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: The Professor said he was taking a brief nap, so we only have time for
      six movies.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Lets take these six Jim Carrey movies and record over them.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You know what movies average out to be really good? The first six Star
      Trek movies!
  - character: CLERK
    dialogue: (shouting) Everybody hit the deck!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (whispering) Sh! Those words are forbidden!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What words? Star Trek?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Sh!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Shut your gills!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That sound! It's patrol car 718! Hide him!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: The court is intrigued. Perhaps we could hear more about these forbidden
      words from someone with a sexilly seductive voice.
  - character: TAKEI
    dialogue: With pleasure. You see, the show was banned after the Star Trek wars.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: You mean after the vast migration of Star Wars fans?
  - character: NICHOLS
    dialogue: No, that was the Star Wars trek.  By the 23rd century, Star Trek fandom
      had evolved from a loose association of nerds with skin problems into a full-blown
      religion.
  - character: PRIEST
    dialogue: And Scotty beamed them to the Klingon ship where they would be no Tribble
      at all.
  - character: CONGREGATION
    dialogue: All power to the engines.
  - character: NICHOLS
    dialogue: As country after country fell under its influence, world leaders became
      threatened by the movements power. And so the Trekkies were executed in the
      manner most befitting virgins.
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: He's dead, Jim!  He's dead, Jim!  He's dead, Jim!
  - character: NICHOLS
    dialogue: Finally, the sacred texts were banned.
  - character: TAKEI
    dialogue: The last copies of the 79 episodes and six movies were dumped on the
      forbidden world Omega 3. Along with that blooper reel where the door doesn't
      close all the way.
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: Thus, Star Trek was forever scoured from human memory.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Another classic science-fiction show cancelled before its time.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: I've never heard of such a brutal and shocking injustice that I cared
      so little about. Next witness.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Bender the robot, please take the stand.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: She's all yours, buddy!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'd only met the defendant, Fry, once, but I knew he was up to no good.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Please use the beeps.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Mr. Nimoy, I came as soon as I heard what happened centuries ago. I
      can't believe your show was banned.
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You know? 1966? 79 episodes, about 30 good ones.
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: Oh, really, I've done too many things to remember one particular TV
      series. But if-if you want to discuss my books of poetry--
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Come on! Remember that episode where you go high on spores and smacked
      Kirk around?
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: No. Perhaps you're thinking of my one man show about Vincent van Spock--
      Uh, uh, I mean van Gogh! Damn!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aha! You can't escape it!
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: (crying) Oh, you're right, I can't.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, jeez, don't get upset. I mean, OK I outwitted you, but--
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: (crying) No, it's my fellow cast members. 300 years ago they left Earth
      behind.
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: This planet doesn't appreciate us anymore, Leonard.
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: Bill, you are, and always shall be, my friend. But I just signed a six-month
      lease on my apartment. I can't walk away from a commitment like that.
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: Very well, my friend.
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: (crying) Why did the world turn its back on our obvious greatness?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm literally angry with rage! Your co-stars may be gone but we can
      still get those episode tapes back for the whole world to see. Come on!
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: Oh!
  - character: FRAKES
    dialogue: Yes! Front row!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You can't go to Omega 3; It's forbidden! I forbid you!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But we have to! The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the
      future.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But it's set 800 years in the past!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, why is this so important to you?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: '''Cause it-it taught me so much. Like how you should accept people,
      whether they be black, white, Klingon or even female. But most importantly,
      when I didn''t have any friends, it made me feel like maybe I did.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I guess I can't let you go alone.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'll go too, with Leonard's permission, of course.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We're entering the Omega system.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Forbidden shmer-shmidden! What are they gonna do, write a letter? (sarcastic)
      Ooh, I'm so scared!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I've lost control of the ship!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh, dip!
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: Dip, indeed!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's all stuff from that forbidden show.
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: So many cardboard sets, so many memories. If only the others--
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: I guess that's my cue.
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: Bill!
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: L-Dog!
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: (laughing) Hey! This is wonderful!
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: Oh, man.
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: I feel like hugging you.
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: Well I would except you have no body! And we're both men.
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: Nichelle! George! Walter! DeForest! Welshy!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Welshy?
  - character: NICHOLS
    dialogue: We did some musical reunion specials in the 2200's but the guy who played
      Scotty had trouble yodelling.
  - character: TAKEI
    dialogue: Ever since then, Welshy has been a welcome participant in our escapades.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I can't believe it! How'd you all end up here?
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: We were on our way to Welshy's cousin's house to stay in the guest room
      when our ship was pulled down to this planet and crashed, just like yours.
  - character: KOENIG
    dialogue: When we woke up, we had these bodies.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Say it in Russian!
  - character: KOENIG
    dialogue: Ven ve voke up ve had these wodies.
  - character: FRY

    dialogue: You'll love it here. Everything is provided for us. And we never age.
      Check out these abs!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yowza!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But who's doing all this for you?
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: You know, we never thought about it. We're famous celebrities -- we're
      used to this sort of treatment.
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: It is I!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa! What a cheesy effect!
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: I am not an effect! You doubt my power?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I do.
  - character: WELSHY
    dialogue: (shouting) Aye!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (screaming) Welshy!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: This court will now hear some very sensual testimony from this court's
      ex-lover, Turanga Leela.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Go  yourself.
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: Behold another power, different from the one you saw earlier.
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: Hey! A body! Buff, tan. Yeah, this is mine alright!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Alright, you gas, what's the deal?
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: Centuries ago, the videotaped adventures of the Enterprise crew rained
      down upon my planet. Over and over, I watched them. Especially the five with
      the energy beings. I am Melllvar! Seer of the tapes, knower of the episodes!
      Tremble before my encyclopaedic knowledge of Star Trek!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Tremble? I laugh. Nobody knows more about Star Trek than me!
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: I beg to differ.  Long have I waited for the one who played Spock. At
      last, we can begin.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Cool! A Star Trek convention!
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: Uh, Melllvar, can you give us some idea of how long this is going to
      last?
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: Until time stops.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What?
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: He can't do this!
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: You can't be serious!
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: Now, we have a full schedule of events--
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, can people who hate Star Trek leave?
  - character: KOENIG
    dialogue: Good question!
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: No, you have to stay even longer.
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: Um, uh, sign it to Melllvar. "Melllvar" has three "L's".
  - character: TAKEI
    dialogue: I think I've done enough conventions to know how to spell "Melllvar".
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Say "nerd"!
  - character: ALL
    dialogue: Nerd!
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: (spoken-word) I'm Slim Shady, Yes, I'm the real Shady, All you other
      Slim Shadys are just imitating, So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
      Please stand up, Please stand up.
  - character: KOENIG
    dialogue: How can you do a spoken-word version of a rap song?
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: He found a way.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'For one hundred quatloos: Who did the captain maroon on Ceti Alpha
      V?'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh ... Khan?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Correct.
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: My button has broken. The trivia contest has ended. I-I now have a surprise.
      You will perform a fan script, written by the ultimate Trek fan.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You have my fan script?
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: I meant me! Melllvar is the ultimate fan!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (smug) Oh, I was confused because the scoreboard says something different.
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: Trivia contest over! Take your scripts! We have limited rehearsal time.
      Now, I didn't make enough copies of the script so George and Walter will have
      to share.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, you probably don't want us to see you rehearsing, or it'll give
      away the ending.
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: That's right! The ending must not be ruined.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We'll go wait in the ship.
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: OK.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Not 'til I get my 600 quatloos!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This is wrong. We shouldn't have abandoned them there.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I dunno, I'm feeling pretty good about it.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I didn't wanna leave them either, Fry, but what are we supposed to do?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, usually on the show someone would come up with a complicated plan
      then explain it with a simple analogy.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hmm. If we can re-route engine power through the primary weapons and
      reconfigure them to Melllvar's frequency, that should overload his electro-quantum
      structure.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Like putting too much air in a balloon!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Of course! It's so simple!
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: (reading) Alas, my ship, whom I love like a woman, is .. .disabled.  Oh,
      Lord!
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: (reading) Fascinating, captain, and logical too. Yet we need some help.
  - character: TAKEI
    dialogue: (reading) Look, captain, Melllvar will help us.
  - character: KOENIG
    dialogue: (reading) Keptin, I wope he will welp our ... vessel.
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: Wessel!  You're not acting hard enough!
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: Melllvar, you have to respect your actors. When I directed Star Trek
      IV I got a magnificent performance out of Bill because I respected him so much.
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: And when I directed Star Trek V I got a magnificent performance out
      of me, because I respected me so much!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) OK! I'm done re-kafoobling the energy motron ... or, whatever.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fire!
  - character: NICHOLS
    dialogue: (reading) My, what a handsome energy creature you are. I love you.  Hey,
      you wrote it!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Its not working! He's drawing straight from our weapons.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Like a balloon and ... something bad happens.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yup!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So, uh, how's rehearsal going?
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: Lousy. Here I've been admiring a bunch of actors while you, a crew of
      genuine space heroes, risked your lives to save them.
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: Hey! We've done heroic things too.
  - character: NICHOLS
    dialogue: Yeah! In the third season I kissed Shatner!
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: Silence! My whole world has turned upside-down. I have but one option.
  - character: KOENIG
    dialogue: Keep them and let us go?
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: No! To determine who is more worthy of my fanatical devotion I shall
      pit you together against each other in armed combat ... To the death!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Where'd you get an idiotic idea like that?
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: Episodes 19, 46, 56 and 77.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Great list. Except, you forgot episode 66!
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: I was getting to that one!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: So Melllvar ordered a battle to the death. I assume no one survived.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Can we get on with this? My foot's getting tired!
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: 'This will be your standard battle to the death. The only weapons: Whatever
      you can find. But I warn you, do nothing until I have signalled the start of
      combat. OK, start.'
  - character: KOENIG
    dialogue: I don't have much experience at fighting-- Except with you guys.
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: I have an idea. Wasn't there an episode where I threw my shoe at the
      enemy?
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: You mean Doohan?
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: Whoever it was, I did it like this.
  - character: TAKEI
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: My foot's cold!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: There, we can make these into spears.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows
      and arrows.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And we can use this machine gun to shoot them! Yee-haw!  That was fun!
  - character: NICHOLS
    dialogue: What if I distract them with my famous fan dance?
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: Oh, that's good, good, good, good. And then, George, you give them a
      karate chop!
  - character: TAKEI
    dialogue: I find that offensive. Just because I'm of Japanese ancestry you assume
      I know karate. Have I ever led you to believe I've studied karate?
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: Well, no, but you never talk about yourself.
  - character: TAKEI
    dialogue: (sadly) Maybe if you showed a little interest.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, here goes nothing.
  - character: NICHOLS
    dialogue: (sexfully) Hello, boys!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa!
  - character: TAKEI
    dialogue: Hi-yah!
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: There's no right way to hit a woman.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Then do it the wrong way.
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: Fine. Yah!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Is that all you've got? Hi-yah!
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: See you in h--
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Come on, Walter!
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: Take that!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It hurts!
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: Let's see if this actually works!  Hm. Ow! Ow! Ow!
  - character: KOENIG
    dialogue: My face!
  - character: TAKEI
    dialogue: Ow! My face too!
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: May I?  Oh!
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: Excellent! Excellent!
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: Leela, please. This is exactly what Melllvar wants. We're just pawns
      in his diabolical game of checkers. Can't we resolve our differences some other
      way?
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: Aw, but Mom, I'm playing with my collectables!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: All this time we thought he was a powerful super-being, yet he was just
      a child.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Alright, Koenig, I've wanted to do this for years!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender, wait! This is our chance to escape, before Melllvar comes back.
      But we all need to work together.
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: I love you so much!
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: Hello?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We've decided to work together.
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: Uh, so did they.
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: Now, how do we escape?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We can't use our ship; We have life support but the engines are wrecked.
  - character: TAKEI
    dialogue: Ironic Because our engines work but our life support systems don't.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey, if your engines work--
  - character: TAKEI
    dialogue: And your life support systems work--
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Stop! You're just goin' around in circles! (to himself) Think, Fry,
      think! Everyone's depending on you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We're too heavy. You guys need to lose some weight, fast!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look, Leonard, we're light enough to keep the tapes! Isn't that great?
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: I'm living in a gefilte fish jar.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We did it!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Melllvar's got a spaceship!
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: Yes, in mint condition. And you made me take it out of the package!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: The Nimbus! We're saved!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: You're under arrest. Prepare to be boarded.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: So I boarded you, eh. What happened next?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You started this stupid court martial. Now if you don't mind, we're
      still fighting Melllvar!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: One more hit and we're done for!
  - character: TAKEI
    dialogue: Let's take 'em out with us. Do you guys have a self-destruct code? Like
      "destruct sequence 1-A, 2-B, 3--"
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Thanks a lot, Takei, now everybody knows!
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: If I can't have the original cast of Star Trek, no one will! Prepare
      to die!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait! If they mean that much to you, why do you wanna kill them?
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: Because I ... I ... I dunno what I'd do without them.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'Melllvar, you can''t let a TV show be your whole life. You can do anything
      you want. Look at Walter Koenig: After Star Trek, he became an actor.'
  - character: KOENIG
    dialogue: Not just an actor, but a well-rounded person, with my own friends and
      credit cards and keys.
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: Well, I guess I could move out of my parents' basement ... maybe get
      a temp job.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Whoa, whoa! One step at a time.
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: I thank you, Fry. You know, you and I are of a kind. In a different
      reality I could have called you "friend".
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Episode 10, Balance Of Terror.
  - character: MELLLVAR
    dialogue: More like episode nine, loser! In your face! Victory is mine!
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: I wonder, my friends, was he really such an evil energy gas?
  - character: NICHOLS
    dialogue: He did give us eternal youth.
  - character: KOENIG
    dialogue: 24-hour Laundromat.
  - character: TAKEI
    dialogue: A full assortment of rum, both spiced and regular.
  - character: NIMOY
    dialogue: Truly, it was a paradise.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And all you had to put up with was one really annoying Star Trek fan.
  - character: SHATNER
    dialogue: Let's get the hell outta here!

  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Hurry up with the water, I'm steaming in my own shell I am, it's that
      hot it is!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Heyya!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Man it's hot! (different voice.) How hot is it? (normal voice.) It's
      so hot I poured McDonalds Coffee in my lap to cool off.  Jonny Carson said it.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No! Nibbler, don't drink the pool water! It's full of chlorine!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Lightweights! Oh wait - chlorine!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Perhaps this movie will help us take our minds off the heat.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, we just need one of those big ice cubes. Someone should call the
      losers who are supposed to deliver it.  Hello?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You heard the good news everyone! Save the Earth, et cetera et cetera!  Bye!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait! Where do we get the ice?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: The wha? Oh Halley's Comet of course. The only sufficient source of
      ice cubes that don't have bugs in them!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow! Mining a comet, that sounds fun!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes there's no safer occupation than mining. Especially when you're
      on a snowball whipping through space at a million miles an hour!  Safe!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Deploying ice drill.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow! That ice dispenser's so big, the ice crushes you!  Yakov Smirnov
      said it!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No he didn't.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Activating ice drill.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh my God! It's out of ice! Like some outer space Motel 6!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Completely out of ice?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: This could mean the end of the bana daquiri as we know it...also life.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender? Are you crying?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well everybody, I just saved a turtle, what have you done with your
      lives?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: You went all the way to Holland already?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender a turtle isn't yourself. Why do you care about it?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Because I also care deeply of things that remind me of myself. Like
      poor little Shelly here.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: What could you possibly have in common with this walking soup mix?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: For one thing, we both have a tough outer shell.  But lead a rich, inner
      life. Also...well you know...
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You're both alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain smoking gamblers?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No! Its just...neither of us can get up when we get knocked on our back.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What? I've seen you get up off your back tons of times.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Those times I was slightly on my side.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Interesting. Maybe we should test this erectile disfunction of yours
      Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, that's not necessary, really! I think I hear my factory recalling
      me.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh! That's what I get for sharing my vulnerability with you people.
  - character: VAN
    dialogue: Calling all scientists, calling all scientists. Be advised there will
      be a worldwide conference on global warming in Kyoto, Japan.
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: I've got a degree in homeopathic medicine!
  - character: VAN
    dialogue: You've got a degree in baloney!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Professor Farnsworth, you're a scientist!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Forget it, I'm not going! I have my reasons! Shut up all of you!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Strange. You haven't acted suspicious since I found those "ape bones"
      in the basement.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: My hip hurts! I'm in the middle of cooking a turkey! I have warranty
      cards to fill out! I'm not just making excuses! Alright I'll go!
  - character: CROWD
    dialogue: Oh God I can't believe it! I love you!
  - character: RIVERS
    dialogue: Oh oh! It's Hubert Farnsworth! He's looking fab in a standard white
      lab coat and dark slacks! His wristwatch is Casio.
  - character: VAN
    dialogue: Thank you all for coming! It is my pleasure to introduce the host of
      the Kyoto Global Warming Convention, the inventor of the environment and First
      Emperor of the Moon - Al Gore!
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: I have ridden the mighty Moon Worm.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Good for him!
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: My fellow Earthicans, as I discuss in my book, Earth In The Balance
      and the much more popular Harry Potter And The Balance Of Earth we need to defend
      our planet against pollution. As well as dark wizards.
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: That's why I'm offering a bag of Moon Saphires to the scientist who
      can solve this problem once and for all.  Lovely aren't they?
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: First up is Professor Ogden Wernstrom.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Wernstrom!
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: Ahem. Ladies and Gentlemen. I have placed in orbit a giant mirror that
      will reflect 40% of the sun's rays. Thus cooling Earth. Observe.
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: Problem solved.
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: Ooo, that's a little bright.
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: Alright, What else we got?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Professor, you're a Professor. You must have some ideas.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Absolutely not! I won't speak! I've got nothing to hide!
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: Our next speaker is -
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I demand the floor!
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: Yes, it's your turn to speak.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well nuts to me. I'm taking the stage! I know the source of the greenhouse
      gases. But in my shame I've kept it secret for 75 long years. Ohhh, it haunts
      my memory still.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Professor no, don't do it!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Don't do what? Don't use this memory ray so I can remember what happened
      back then?
  - character: PROTOTYPE
    dialogue: Oh dear. Might I favour master with a tender kiss on the forehead?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh dear, I've failed again.
  - character: PROTOTYPE
    dialogue: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Ooo, ouch, stop!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: What was that?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: A flaming burp.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Does it always do that?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Its not always a burp. We still have one problem though. This robot
      will never meet emission standards.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Crap spackle!  We'll just call it a sport utility robot and classify
      it as a light truck!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well...I suppose the environment can take one more for the team.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Take me now you stud!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh this is all my fault!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's awful Professor. Especially the making out part.
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: Yeah, I didn't need to hear that.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: All modern robots descend from my original smog blasting designs. And
      that's the cause of global warming today.
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: Uh, so the robots are to blame. As I suspected.  We are left with only
      one possible course of action. Grim though it be.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I got a good feeling about this!
  - character: WERNSTROM
    dialogue: We must immediately and permanently shut down, dismantle and destroy
      all robots!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Wait, surely there's a better -
  - character: VAN
    dialogue: The conference is over.
  - character: GORE
    dialogue: I must go now, to help collect cans on Jupiter. Peace out ya'll!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Poor Bender.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Be brave my friend.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Come on. You've got to come out of your chest sometime.  Would you do
      it for a Bender snack?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ah ha!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Gotcha!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Ooo, it's a party. Apparently.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Strange. Why would Nixon, an awkward, uncomfortabble man suddenly throw
      a party? One of the most social events imaginable. It's a trap is why! They're
      going to deactivate all the robots! I don't hear any gasping.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We all figured that out.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Ohh!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, I'm off.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait. We could hide you! We'll pile fruit on you and claim you're a
      bowl.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No. I'm going to the party.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I won't let you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fry, as you know, there are lots of things I'm willing to kill for.
      Jewels, vengence, Father O'Mally's weedwhacker. But at long last I've found
      something I'm willing to die for. This mindless turtle.

    dialogue: Bender, this world isn't good enough for you.

    dialogue: Not even close. Goodbye everybody. Don't touch my stuff after I'm dead!  (shouting)

    dialogue: Attention happenin' robots. Who's got what it takes to party with Nixon?
      You fellas enjoy yourselves for the next two hours. And be sure not to leave
      the island, uh for at least two hours! I'm going out to pick up some smokes.
      Uh really good smokes! Two hours.  OK headless body of Agnoo, lets blow this

    dialogue: Shut up and pay attention to me! Bender. Look, I love life and its pleasures
      as much as anyone here, except perhaps you Hedonismbot.  But we need to be shut
      off! Especially you Hendonismbot!
  - character: HEDONISMBOT
    dialogue: I apologise for nothing!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: We pollute too much. We're destroying the world and killing the turtles.

    dialogue: I've devised a way to save you and to stop global warming at the same
      time! Granted you're all blasting out greenhouse gases.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You're one to talk!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: But we can use those very gases to save the planet. If you all vent
      your exhaust directly upward in one burst it should thrust the Earth further
      from the sun, thus cooling it.  By my calculations we'll need the full force
      of every last robot. So quickly, everyone point your exhaust vents straight
      upwards.  Now vent! Vent like the wind!  Harder! Harder!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Why isn't this working?!

      going to feel this one!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm sorry buddy. At least we'll die on our backs, helpless.  Huh? What
      the hell are you doing?  Hey are you trying to make me look bad?  Ah ha! I'm
      even greater than I thought I was! And now to fullfill my destiny.

      that make the year longer?

    dialogue: Ahem! For my next trick, notice I have nothing up my sleeves......and
      nothing in my head.  So if my lovely assistant will kindly supply me with an
      ordinary, non-fake pitcher of milk......behold the milk has vanished! Exiled,
      perhaps, to another dimension!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Amazing! That's why they call you "Bender The Magnificent"!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No it isn't!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Whoa! They discovered an intact, 20th Century pizzeria! Just like the
      one I used to work at!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Interesting. No wait the other thing - tedious!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Lets go check it out. You can see how I lived before I met you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You lived before you met me?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sure. Lots of people did.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Really?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Truly, they were as Gods who build this place!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait a second! This is Panucci's! I used to work in this exact pizzeria!
      And for your information lady, this was not just used to paddle my butt, it
      was also used to move pizzas and crush rats.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Don't wave your fancy degrees at me. I recognise all this stuff.  Petrified
      sausages, Old Mr Patelli, and that's -
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Pizza delivery for Mr......Seymour Asses.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I wouldn't count on it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Aww. Poor little guy. You look like you haven't eaten in a month. Here......but
      if Mr Panucci asks, your name is Seynour Asses!  I like you Seymour, you're
      not constantly judging me like all the other dogs - are you? Nah. We understand
      each other.  People think you're a dumb mutt who smells bad, can't find a girlfriend
      and has a crummy job. But you're keepin' it real and call no man "Mister."  Well
      goodbye.  Live long and prosper.

    dialogue: Ow ow ow!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm taking him home and I'd like to see anyone try and stop me.  Uh-oh!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ow, oo ow, oo ah!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: '...And then he was ejected by the guards. Needless to say, I was mortified.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well it's not right to make my dead pet an exhibit. That's like digging
      up Lassie and putting her on display in the Louvre.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Lassie is on display in the Louvre.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I know, I was deliberately describing a similar situation.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Why don't you try protesting? Like those native Martians. Always whining
      that people don't treat their ancestor's bones with respect.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Nah, protesting never works.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You're right.  I'll give it a shot!

  - character: PANUCCI
    dialogue: That's a good Seymour!
  - character: BOY
    dialogue: Yo! There's dog fur on my slice!
  - character: PANUCCI
    dialogue: Nah, that's vermicelli! No fur in here!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'He''s so cute! He can do two things at one time: Eat and swim. Ooo
      - three things.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, its been three days. You can't keep boogie-ing like this. You'll
      come down with a fever of some sort.
  - character: BEELER
    dialogue: Mr. Fry? I'm Dr Ben Beeler, the paleontologist who discovered your dog,
      or as some call it, the Beeler-saurus.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So do I get Seymour back? Are you caving to political pressure?
  - character: BEELER
    dialogue: No we're sorry but there's just too much that fossil can teach us about
      dogs from your time.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: His name was Seymour. He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering
      saxaphonist. He had wet dog smell, even when dry. And he was not above chasing
      the number 29 bus.
  - character: RAY
    dialogue: The 29? Interesting.
  - character: BEELER
    dialogue: That's all I needed, Ray?
  - character: RAY
    dialogue: I'm good.
  - character: BEELER
    dialogue: OK then, here's your dog back.

  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Stop!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Good news everyone!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hooray, he's back! He's looking for a garbage can to put that dog in!
      Here you go buddy!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No, actually we've discovered Fry's dog was fast-fossilised, preserving
      it's cellular structure!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Which means...we can clone it! Seymour will live again!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: A little land mammal!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Can you believe it Bender? I'm going to have my best friend back!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Why the idiot convention?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Ah Cubert, my precious babe. I'm going to attempt to clone Fry's dog.
      Using the very same apparatus I used to clone you!  Ooo look, there's a smidge
      of toe still in here.  You see, beneath the fossil's crunchy, mineral shell,
      there's still a creamy core of dog nougat!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So will Seymour remember how to sing Walking On Sunshine?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Amazingly yes. In cases of rapid fossilisation, I can press this brain
      scan button, retrieving Seymour's memories at the precise instant of doggy death!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm gonna get my puppy back! In your face, Grim Reaper!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Crappy ineffective Reaper!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I just need to reset the Clone-O-Mat from Human Mode to Dog Mode.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Uh-oh, this may take a while.
  - character: KID
    dialogue: You stink loser!
  - character: PANUCCI
    dialogue: Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out. C'mon!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But I'm celebrating New Years Eve.
  - character: PANUCCI
    dialogue: Like you got squat to celebrate! You're a delivery boy this millenium
      and you'll be a delivery boy next millenium!  What's with Seymour? Its like
      he don't want you to go. Or he thinks your pants is too short or somethin'.
      Which is crazy 'cause frankly you look fabulous. Now get goin'!!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I won't be gone long Seymour. Just wait here 'til I come back.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hello? Pizza delivery for......Icy Wiener?! Aw crud! I always thought
      at this point in my life I'd be the one making the crank calls!  Here's to another
      lousy Millenium.  What the?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: A dog collar for me?  You shouldn't have!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's for Seymour.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh.  Say why'd you get me a subscription to the Daily Growl? That's
      not a reputable journal of opinion.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh that's also for Seymour. I'm getting everything ready for when he's
      cloned.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Are you on the jump Fry? Why are you wasting time on a creature of inferior
      intelligence?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey he was smart. He could fetch.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I can fetch.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: He could dig up bones.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hello? Charlamange?  Plus, I'll bet he couldn't create a laser show
      with his head.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look Bender, this has nothing to do with you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's impossible!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Now if you'll excuse me I'm working on Seymour's doghouse.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No one ever asks if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house.
      Not that I would. A tiny little house that says "Bender" on it.  Ow!
  - character: YANCY
    dialogue: Hello first baloney of the new millenium! Ah here he comes. That's him
      and Seymour.
  - character: YANCY
    dialogue: He's trying to tell us something. Maybe he can lead us to Philip.
  - character: YANCY
    dialogue: Should we follow him?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Are you two gonna be done soon?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Sorry, but we need to practice hand to hand combat in case an enemy
      knocks the laser gun out of our hands and they slide waaay across the room.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well could you do it some place else? I'm setting up Seymour's doggy
      bed.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Heel boy, heel! Oh hello Fry, I guess I didn't notice you there. I'm
      having such fun with my new best friend Robo-Puppy.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I was just out walking him. Yes. You can walk him. Of course, after
      he goes you have to refill the canisters. C'mere boy! Pet, pet, pet.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Bender, are you jealous of Fry's puppy? That's so adorable!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Jealous? Hah!  Not while I have the love of Robo-Puppy here. Robo-Puppy,
      lick my cheek.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Robo-Puppy truly is robots best friend! Eh?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ah there, perfect!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Woohoo!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Yay!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Finally!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Behold once more the mighty Clone-O-Mat! Requiring such vast amounts
      of electricity that we must harness the elemental power of nature itself!  I
      speak of course...of molten lava! Deep within the Earth's core. To the sub-basement!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Come on boy! Come back to life!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fry c'mon, the talent show!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What? I'm in the middle of something.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But, if we don't perform, in what sense do we have an act?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender, enough! Leave me alone!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So that's how it is huh? I thought you were my friend. But if you love
      your dog so much then maybe you'd rather play fetch!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Oh!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Now I'm all you got!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I hate you! I hate you! You evil metal man!  Ow!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So anyway your dog is melted. Now we're friends again.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Not necessarily. For the dog may yet survive.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: May yet? Really?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Indeed. You see, that fossil was made of dolomite. The tough black mineral
      that won't cop out when there's heat all about. By contrast, observe the lava's
      affect on this ice swan.  Of course, that would have melted even at room temperature.
      I just wanted to get rid of it. But had it been made of that righteous mineral
      dolomite, there's a slim chance it might have survived.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So Seymour might still exist?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Perhaps. For a few minutes. It's dolomite baby!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Then I'm goin' in after him.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: No!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Stop!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: He'd come after me.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Acting like a moron won't bring your dog back.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Then all hope is lost.  Goodbye Seymour.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Please stop crying Fry. Here.  I assumed you were just pretending to
      love the dog. To toy with my emotions. Oh what have I done?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: You didn't do anything. Don't beat yourself up.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior
      creature. Because I love you. Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks, but in the
      way a robot loves a human, a human loves a dog and occassionally, a gorilla
      loves a kitty.  I'm goin' in!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I'm a professor! Why isn't anyone listening to me? You can't go in because
      you'll melt. The fossil only has a chance because it's made of dolomite!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm 40% dolomite!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh it's hot, it's very hot!
  - character: CRYOGENISIST
    dialogue: Ugh, I am one hungover cryogenisist! Just throw that mutt in the freezer
      until his owners get here!
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: You can't solve all your problems by freezing them boss.
  - character: CRYOGENISIST
    dialogue: I think you're forgetting our motto.
  - character: CRYOGENISIST
    dialogue: Oh you must be the Fry's. Yeah he's right over there.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender's been down there too long. I'm going in after him.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Professor! Lava! Hot!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: This is all my fault. I let my best friend risk his life just to get
      my dead dog back.  Bender!!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And that is why they call me Bender The Magnificent!  Hey where'd everybody
      go?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: OK! Let's clone us some dog!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Very well. Let this abomination unto the Lord begin!  Interesting. It
      seems Seymour died at the ripe old age of 15.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 15? You mean he lived for 12 more years after I got frozen?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Indeed.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Stop the cloning.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh sure! Smash the smart guy's machine!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fry, what's wrong?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Think about it. Seymour lived a full life after I was gone. He probably
      added new songs to his repertoire.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But that's a good thing. Walking On Sunshine sucks noodles!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I had Seymour 'til he was three. That's when I knew him and that's when
      I loved him.  I'll never forget him. But he forgot me a long long time ago.

    dialogue: Mmm. The ingredients are cooked. And they've picked up some of your
      natural robot flavourings. Time to add the yeast.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeast? You mean I'll have a lifeform growing inside me? (crying) It's
      so beautiful.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Talk to me.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: (Farnsworth's voice) Sorry I can't come down to say goodbye, but I'm
      busy inventing useless junk.
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: (Farnsworth's voice) And I smell bad.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Hey!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: If you were my kids you'd get quite a talking to...from your father......when
      he got home from the senate.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh bother, what have they done now?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake delivery.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: The address was on Dogdoo 8 but the universe ends right after Dogdoo
      7!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Child man, is this true?
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Yeah, but why are you mad at us? Your dummy brigade wasted a week on
      an obviously fake mission!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Plus, you're making bootleg beer inside company property!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Lies! Lies and slander!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed? That's the last straw! You boys
      have been underfoot long enough!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: You jerked the words right outta my mouth. We're their fathers and its
      high time we acted like it.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ooo-hoo! Here comes violence!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Get a job you lazy kids!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I guess if you want children beaten......you have to do it yourself.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Come on Dad, shuffle faster!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: You don't wanna miss the unveiling of our new company do you?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Company?  (mocking) How cute! What will you be pedalling? Lemonade?
      Shoe shines? Cootie insurance?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (mocking) Perhaps they've constructed a teddybear hospital!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Actually, we're starting a competing delivery company.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Welcome to the world of business!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Who's going to use a delivery service with a kicked sign? Nobody that's
      who!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: But we already have a client signed up! We're delivering the Daily Supernova.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: So your delivery company is just a cute harmless paper route?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Phew!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: No. Its a serious business.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (mocking) Yes its a tremendous responsibility alright!  What if a paper
      were to land in a puddle?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: (mocking) Civilisation as we know it might get splashed!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Why do they always treat us like dumb kids? We're practically old enough
      to find the Fox Network infantile!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Ah we'll show 'em. All Awesome Express needs is a sturdy interstellar
      delivery craft!  Voila! You got a quarter?
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Man, that ad said to allow four to six seconds for delivery.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: More like seven!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm really starting to swell up with beer. I must look ridiculous.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No, you have a healthy glow.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh my God! I just felt it ferment!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Ooo! Let me feel.  Have you thought about what to name it?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I was thinking Benderbrau if it's an ale, Botweiser if it's a lager.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I hope it's a lager so I can take it to a ball game.  Ooo! I felt that
      one!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Uh, there's a crack in the hull here. That could cause explosive decompression.
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Put a sticker on it.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Off on your first delivery eh? You be careful my little tinkler.  Remember
      we used to call you that huh? Tinkler?
  - character: SAL
    dialogue: Gets movin'! Those newspapers won'ts deliver themselveses! Only the
      Sunday edition can dos that.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Goodness there must be 50 papers in that bundle! That's a big number,
      50.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Yeah if you're an idiot!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: 3. 2. 1.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: All systems go.
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Blast off!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: (shouting) See you at din-din!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (shouting) I'm blowing you a kiss.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Take evasive action!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (shouting) It's closing in! You can't avoid it! It's a cheek-seeker.
      And...gotcha!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Business is down. So I filed papers to have you all reclassified as
      slaves.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well, well, well. If it isn't our little muchkin moguls!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: What's the trouble men? Need some penny rolls for your profits?
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Actually, thank's to Dwight's brilliant accounting and my unaccountable
      brilliance......our paper route now has over a million customers!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: We're finally making more money than you guys! Aren't you impressed
      now Pops? Aren'tcha? Aren'tcha?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Uh, in a small way yes. But you still don't have your own building,
      your own conference table or...or one of those things!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Hello!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Our Dads are never impressed, no matter what we do.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Maybe we should start a fire.
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: If we really want to impress them we'll have to crush them with strategy...Dwight
      Lightning!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Very well. But I get to name the next strategy.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You know how much an apartment that big would cost on the Sun?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: People, as you know our young sons have become great successes in the
      very same field as us.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Naturally, we're humiliated.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That's why we need you, our loyal crew, to make Planet Express 800%
      more profitable.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: We'll start by slashing salaries. And this time I mean really slash.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh guys, I don't know how to tell you this. So I'll just let Fry blurt
      it out thoughtlessly.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We don't work for you anymore!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: What?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Dwight and Cubert made us a better offer. We're paperboys now.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Incoming! We got papers to stuff team! Hup two hup two!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yes sir!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: On our way!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We're on it Mr Farnsworth!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Folks, the situation is grim but we shall prevail, thanks to you, our
      crack team of loyal dregs!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: I don't even know who this guy is!
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: I'm Scruffy, the janitor.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes, of course you are. Now we've got to buckle down and save Planet
      Express.
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: I'm on break.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Sorry to interrupt this "whirlwind of activity" but we have an announcement.
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: I direct your attention to these forms, which I'm presently engaged
      in handing to you.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Sweet guineapig of Winnipeg! They've taken over our company!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Balderdash! I never agreed to that!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: No. But you did declare yourself dead three years ago as a tax dodge.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Tax dodge nothing! You take one nap in a ditch in the park and they
      start declaring you this and that.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Either way I technically inherit your building and your spaceship. Which
      mean Planet Express is now......Awesome Express!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: (angry) You rotten kids! (nicely) Will you be hiring?
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: No.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: (angry) You rotten kids!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: There. One million papers. Folded and loaded!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Hey Leela, help me apply these flame decals I got in my cereal. They'll
      make the ship go faster.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: And what's your scientific basis for thinking that?
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: I'm 12.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Did I ever tell you how I used to own that ship?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: There but for the grace of God.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) Hush little brewsky don't you leak. Daddy wants to drink for
      at least a week.  Oh my God! I think it's time!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hurry Leela, get some coasters and cold mugs.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Push Bender push!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You're doing great!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It feels like I'm trying to push a water bed out of me.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Almost there. Just two more bottles.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Is it OK? I can't hear anything.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's an ale! 5 gallons, 6 ounces!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Hey, what's goin' on? This is a delivery company not a delivery room!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: We just busted our bums delivering a million newspapers and this is
      how you greet us? With a bunch of frosty cold beers?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey wait a second. How did you deliver a million papers in one hour?
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Uh...we just did OK? 'Cause we're awesome! Yeah!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Yeah awesome!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hello, Awesome Express, the rude, crude delivery dudes! How may I direct
      your call?...What's that?...You haven't gotten your paper?...In how long?...
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Uh, might a homeless old man have a touch more beef bourguignon? And
      another tequila slammer?  Please?
  - character: LABARBARA
    dialogue: Don't you sweet talk me you wrinkly old tube sack!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Might I have one too wife?
  - character: LABARBARA
    dialogue: Ah you're both pathetic, being jealous of your own offspring. Now you
      should be happy they became successes, instead of following in your footstamps.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Oh it's true. But they grow up so fast. We just wanted a few more years
      of being better than them.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: They're so stinking talented they don't even need their fathers anymore.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Dad! We screwed up!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You did? Tough luck suckers!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Please, help us Pops. We agreed to deliver way more papers than we can
      handle.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: (crying) But we couldn't handle them so we started dumping the extras
      in a crater on the Moon.
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: (crying) And now everyone's yelling at us about our missing papers!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: (crying) And now we don't know what to do!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Why did you boys do all this?
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: (crying) We just wanted you to be proud of us.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Proud of you? You ruined us with sleazy business practices and a complete
      disregard for human decency. But, of course we're proud of you.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Damn right we are! Now come on. Let's go do a little Father/Son weaseling
      out of this.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: OK boys, let me show you how a paper man does it.
  - character: BOY
    dialogue: Au revoir!!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Can I use the gun Dad?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Aw what kind of father would I be if I said no?
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Only one house to go. We did it!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Run away! That bully Bret Blob lives there!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: He's ugly, mean, stupid, stink, mucus! And last week...we sort of...broke
      his window.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Alright, alright. What do we do when we break somebody's window?
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: (sheepish) Pay for it?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Heavens no! We apologise! With nice cheap words!
  - character: BRET
    dialogue: I thought I heard the doorbell but I see it was the dorkbell!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Man, we had it coming Bret!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Now now, no need to give us the business. We'd like a word with you
      daddy.
  - character: BRET
    dialogue: Whatever. (shouting) Daaad!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Don't worry boys. I'm sure his father is a perfectly normal reasonable
      man.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Mr Blob, our sons have come to apologise for damaging your window. They've
      learned their lesson and they want to make amends.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: (ashamed) Sorry sir.
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: (ashamed) Yeah, sorry.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Now see here. We assured our sons that you'd accept their apology.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No one gives my son that option!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Bring it on Jello-pop!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Yeah go Dad!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Show 'em who's boss!  Get 'em...Pops!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: That was incredible! You are the bravest dads in the entire trauma centre!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: You guys almost had him...until he digested you.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Aww, you're good kids.  If I could feel anything right now, it would
      be pride. I was wrong! I can still feel pain!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: He's coming to finish the job. Someone toss me out the window!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I suppose.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey chumps! I heard you were on the ass end of an ass kicking so I figured
      you could use a couple of these babys!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Oh why not! Might as well live it up as long as I 've got this catheter
      in me!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Uh, won't join us Mr Blob?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: This is what makes life worth clinging to. Three fathers, enjoying a
      day out with their sons.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: 'It would seem we''ve taught our boys a lesson about life: Man or Blob,
      it''s whats inside that counts.'

  - character: AMY
    dialogue: If you wanna do something, you do it! And to splick with the consequences!

    dialogue: You know? Like how I live every day.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Happy Freedom Day! Ooh! I think my wrist is broken.

      Tub!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Mmm! That'll feel nice on my shattered bones!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow! Nude hot-tubbing? That's all I need to hear about Freedom Day!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: 'Then consider the following lecture a bonus: On Earth, freedom is a
      given. But on my planet, we have to suffer for it.'
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: That's why I love Earth! You can do what you want, and no-one makes
      you feel guilty because no-one cares.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) We're not listening!
  - character: ZOIDBERG

    dialogue: You're welcome! OK, Morbo, now it's your turn.
  - character: MORBO
    dialogue: If that is your Freedom Day wish.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Thank you, Secretary of Transportation. My fellow Earthicans, we enjoy
      so much freedom, it's almost sickening. We're free to choose which hand our
      sex-monitoring chip is implanted in. And if we don't want to pay our taxes,
      why, we're free to spend a weekend with the Pain Monster.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Cue the fireworks guy!  Incidentally, tonight's Freedom Day celebration
      is brought to you by ...  ... "Shankman's Rubbing Compound". When something
      needs rubbing, think "Shankman".
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yay! Shankman!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: It costs a little more but it's worth it!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: 'Our planet has been through so much this past year: Wars, droughts,
      impeachments! But we''ve never lost our sense of what''s truly important: The
      great taste of "Charleston Chew"!  And now, let us salute that beloved symbol
      of freedom, our flag, Ol'' Freebie!'
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I'm swelling with patriotic mucus!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Anyone who laughs is a Communist!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Knowing that, with a shifty glance skyward, we will see by the rocket's
      red glare, that our flag is still there.  It's gone!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Yes, fellow patriots, I ate your flag. And I did it with pride. For
      to express oneself with doing a thing is the very essence of Freedom Day! Bless
      this planet and all its wonderful people!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: (shouting) Kill him! Kill the traitor!
  - character: MAN
    dialogue: Hey, it's the guy who desecrated our flag!

    dialogue: I'm all scuttled out!  Huh? My planet's embassy? They're paid to not
      kill me! A-yoop!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I thought I understood this world. I thought I was fitting in. But I
      guess I don't belong on here anymore than I belong on our crappy home planet--
      Ooh, sorry.

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train, step aside. You too, fatso.
      Freedom!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Cool your jowls, Nixon. You may not like it that Dr. Zoidberg desecrated
      a flag. You might even find the image of it festering in his bowels somehow
      offensive. But the right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Earth
      constitution.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Aroo! Maybe so. But I know a place where the constitution doesn't mean
      squat.

    dialogue: Who are you, old man?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'll never remember that.
  - character: BENDER

      "Does Not Compute"?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (sad) The sparks keep me warm.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait, you're a lawyer? You're hired!

      Men of the Squash Planet! Squish them!

    dialogue: You bet!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Alright, Kif, let's show these freaks what a bloated, runaway military
      budget can do. Bring me the activation codes for our global defence network.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: (unenthusiastic) Aye, aye, sir.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: We can't be too careful with these codes. Rumour has it a double agent
      may be aboard this very ship.  I'm watching you! You, ensign? What's your name?
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Hugh Man? Now that's a name I can trust. Run down to the central battle
      computer and enter these codes. Chop, chop!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Um, sir? There's something about that ensign that's--

    dialogue: You're damn right there is! That strapping young lad's gunning for your
      job. And he just might get it.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: The enemy approacheth! Lieutenant, fire missile one and recommend me
      for another medal. Make it gaudy, I'm going clubbing later.  Tick, tock!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Sir, all planetary defences have been disabled. Perhaps the Decapodians
      acquired our secret codes, somehow.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Well, Kif, stand by to take the blame. Steady, steady ... now!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love freedom and then enslave all
      of Earth?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Bah! Your planet doesn't deserve freedom until it learns what it is
      to not have freedom. It's a lesson, I say.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What the hell is this dirt pile we're building anyhow?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: None of your beeswax, slave! You'll find out soon enough. Just focus
      on globing that mud. (shouting) Glob!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm no good at being a slave. I'm thinking about graduate school. Y'know?
      To become a barber?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This can't go on. Today is the day we fight back!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's already 10 o'clock!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, you're right. Tomorrow is the day we fight back.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Yeah? Well good luck, sister. All our modern technology is useless.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I know I am.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, wait! I'm having one of those things. You know? A headache with
      pictures?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: An idea?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Back in my day, we didn't have your fancy all-digital weapons but we
      still managed to kill each other just fine.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah, the crossbow. A pitiless, elegant killing machine. The Bender of
      the 15th century.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Not big enough. We need something that can take out an entire army.
      Something you could commit a war crime with--
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wow!  Ow!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Neat!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Ambassador Moivin, you killed my lawyer.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: He defended my freedom when no-one else would. He was a good and honourable
      man.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Is it possible that all this slavery and oppression is shmutzing up
      our freedom lesson?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You haven't won yet, Moivin! You didn't expect us to even go to a museum,
      much less steal this ancient heat-seeking missile.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: All eyes on Zoidberg!  Ew!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, I need that to smoke!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Zoidberg, how could you? I used to think you were cool.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Wait! People of Earth, listen. Yes, I'm desecrating a flag. But to preserve
      the freedom it represents!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Zoidberg, you set us free! I feel like I could stand to hug you! I can't,
      but you know what I'm trying to say.
  - character: CROWD
    dialogue: (chanting) Zoidberg! Zoidberg! Zoidberg!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Ah, if only they appreciated freedom this much on my home planet. Wait
      a second! They do! Because this is my home planet.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: 'And now, to raise this beautiful new flag, a red lobster that won''t
      ruin your dinner: Dr. John Zoidberg!'
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: You're a nice man, Nixon.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Oh, I couldn't.
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: No, no, no, go ahead. You've earned it!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Well, maybe just a taste.  Mmm! Now that's a grand old flag!  I wonder
      what the Shroud of Turin tastes like.

    dialogue: Indeed.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Any calls while I was out?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah. You got a telesonic transmission from Kif a couple hours ago.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: My Kiffie called?  Kif?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Why didn't you just leave a message sweetie?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Not my fault if you don't check me! Messages erased.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Well well well! Do my eyes believe me or is that my bosomy swan, Leela?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good news everyone. You'll be delivering pain medicine to the hive mind
      of Nigel 7.
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: Scruffy's rollin' out a large pill!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You're going to Nigel 7? Kif's on patrol near there! You could drop
      me off on the way!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: We could but we won't! It's a spaceship dammit not a prom limousine!  If
      anyone needs me I'll be in the Angry Dome.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This is a very long trip, so we'll all have to go into hibernative-naptosis
      to save oxygen.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I don't even breathe oxygen!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: They jump right out of their pants! Oh what now? Activate glass window.
      Kif, I'm sensing a very sensual disturbance in the force. Prepare for ship-to-ship
      intimacy!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Yes sir captain!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: How 'bout I help you finish that dream you were having about me?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: 'OK, I was just at this part: Heyya!'
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Uh, let's try that a little lower and a lot softer!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Imagine you stowing away and stealing a licenced starship! Oh it's so
      romantic it gives me the shivvers!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I don't care how much trouble I get in. I needed to feel my lips pressed
      against your lipless beak!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh Amy, I can't stand having a whole universe between us. I've been
      thinking a lot about this and, well, would you move in with me?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Here? But...uh...wouldn't it be crowded?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: No no, it's really twice the size! You can use the floor and, I'll have
      the ceiling! See?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Kif! You have so much creativity and niceness, but......I'm not sure
      if I -

    dialogue: Hush! Before you answer, come thither!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: This is the Holo-Shed. It can simulate anything you desire, and nothing
      can hurt you. Except when it malfunctions and the holograms become real.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Well, that probably won't happen this time.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: 'I wanted to show you what life would be like if we were together. Computer:
      Run program Kif-1.'
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: This is so beautiful!  Spirit! Kif! That's the pony I always wanted
      but my parents said I had too many ponies already!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Yes. I prgorammed it in for you! 4 million lines of BASIC! And, if this
      isn't the life you want, how 'bout this? Run program Kif-2!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Oh Kif!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: We could live here by the shore of the tranquilibrious sea, in a timeshare.
      And I would pluck the moon from the sky, just to see you smile.  Almost got
      it.  It seems to be sort of, stuck! I love you!  Run program Kif://3.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: This isn't bad. My aunt had a place like this.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Amy, we could live in a bus station bathroom for all I care. As long
      as we're together it will feel like a castle to me.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Kif, I'd love to live with you...someday. But before then there's still
      lots I wanna do on my own.  What was that?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh dear. I feel the Holo-Shed might be broken again. Well, as long as
      we don't cross paths with Atilla the -
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Look! Spirit!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: And there's Professor Moriarty, Jack The Ripper, Evil Lincoln!
  - character: MORIARTY
    dialogue: Right-o gents it's another simulation gone mad so murder and mayhem,
      standard procedure!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: The Holo-Shed's on the fritz again, the characters turned real!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Damn. The last time that happened I got slapped with three paternity
      suits. Listen up history's greatest villains......Get back into the Holo-Shed
      before I start blasting!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Spare me your space-age technobabble Atilla The Hun!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Kif! Hold on!

    dialogue: I totally want to!

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Over here!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Hold me!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Have a good one!  Aw, man!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: After all that I could use some relaxation. I'll be in the Holo-Shed.
  - character: DOCTOR
    dialogue: Well, except for a few broken bones, some internal hemoraging and a
      partially barfed up heart, everyone appears fine. Oh and Kif is pregnant.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh joy!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Amy, isn't it wonderful? I'm pregnant!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: And not one of those bogus everyday miracles like a sunrise. Aren't
      you a male?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah what's the deal? Just when I thought I'd figured out you biological
      creatures, its something else! Lemme at 'im!  Come...over...lemme...!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Look, I'm sure we're all a little unclear on how anyone gets pregnant.
      So Kif, pray explain. And don't spare the dirty words where appropriate.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Well it's quite simple really. When one of my species experiences deep
      feelings of love we enter a so called "receptive state."
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: You disgust me! Go on.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: At that point, our skin becomes a semi-permeable membrane which allows
      the passage of genetic material. I held Amy's hand and voila.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh OK. but that better be all there is!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh Amy! You'll be a mother!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: What a wonderous affirmation of our love! And all from the touch of
      your hand.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Dude hold up! Remember when Zapp blew a hole in the ship?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Kif touched everybody there. Couldn't any one of us be the mother?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Hey yeah!  I mean...what about that Kif?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Well I suppose I might have gotten pregnant that way. Or even from a
      toilet seat. Though that's impossible since I have a private washroom.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Ah, my home away from home. By the way Kif, your flush seemed to be
      set on stun, not kill.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Look Kif, I probably am the mother. Although maybe I'm not. Of course
      I hope I am but just in case I'm not, maybe we should have a test.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: A test. I demand a test!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Even I laughed at me when I built this alien cross species genetic analyser
      but I guess I showed myself! Subjects, please enter the chamber.  Now to take
      a DNA sample.  When I pull this switch the maternifuge will spin at 10,000 RPM,
      seperating out everyone who isn't the mother....father...whatever.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Faster! Faster!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good. Fry's ejection indicates that he is not the man-mom.  Nor is Captain
      Brannigan.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh thank you merciful God!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Zoidberg?! What the hell were you doing in there?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: That's where I live. I have no home.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Amy? But that means...
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: 'Leela must have impregnated me when she grabbed my ungloved hand. That
      explains the poster in hygiene class: No Glove, No Love.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wow, this is all so confusing.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Leela! How could you? Our love has had to endure your constant hatred
      and now this? (crying) Stop testing our love!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Please captain. I thank Leela for the DNA she gave me but in my species,
      the true parent is the one that inspired the initial feeling of love. We call
      that person the smizmar. And my smizmar is Amy.
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: So the toilet seat is like the uncle or something?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: 'That''s OK, at least Kif''s baby shower should be fun. I''d better
      put it on my calendar.  (to calendar) Thursday: Baby shower. Enter.  Might as
      well plan for my new life while I''m at it. (to calendar) Set Motherhood Mode.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: To motherhood.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Mom, Dad, I know this is weird but -
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: You're very open-minded Mrs Wong.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Check it out y'all. Everyone we invited is here.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Also Zoidberg!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So lets open the gifts!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Lets start with this one. From Bender.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's my booties from when I was a kid.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Uh, they're already bronzed.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: They are bronze.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: And this one's from Leela, oh I just love the bow! I wonder what it
      is!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Yes I wonder what we got you.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: It's a basket! F-for picnics?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It means a lot to me. It's the basket my parents left me in at the Orphanarium.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: You could use it for picnics.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Is it a party board?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You, you trashed my party board?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh this is the happiest moment of my life! You all brought such wonderful
      gifts! But the greatest gift...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Mine!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: '...is the bond I share with my smizmar Amy. And soon, the quivvering
      mass of life within me will depend on us both. Even now I can sense it feeding,
      squirming, searching, questing and shortly, it will wren my loins into way and
      pull us down, down, down into the deep dark waters of commitment.'
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: That's so beautiful!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh my God!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh how could Amy leave me? When will women learn to take responsibilty
      for the children they've helped create? The quickening! My time is near. I must
      return to my homeworld to perform the ancient birthing rites.
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: Lemme know how that turns out.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: I must now embark on a perilous journey. To give birth in precisely
      the same swamp I was born.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: If it's so dangerous I'd better go with you. A gal has to protect her
      DNA.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: No Leela. Tradition demands that I make this journey with my smizmar,
      and since Amy isn't here I must go it alone. Farewell. For we may never meet
      again.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: My scrapes feel a little better now.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, what's this fat ugly thing? A frog? A toad? Or your momma!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: It's a poisonous froad! No one move.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm back baby!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Behold. The sacred ancestral birthing grounds of my family.

    dialogue: Hi!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: I am Kif of the clan Kroker. I come to bear my young.
  - character: MIDWIFE
    dialogue: Then let the Tea Of New Life be brewed. As it is written "and both shall
      lift the jug together". Where is your smizmar?
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: She's not with me.
  - character: MIDWIFE
    dialogue: Oh the sorrow. Oh the shame. I'm sorry I'm probably just making you
      feel worse.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: As long as Amy is with me in my heart I will have the strength of two.  Apparently
      Amy hasn't been working out much lately.
  - character: MIDWIFE
    dialogue: As the tea boils please join hands with your beloved smizmar.  Oh right
      sorry, but I memorised the ceremony by heart and it mentions her a lot.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: I'll try to endure.
  - character: MIDWIFE
    dialogue: Good 'cause I'm not changing it. Now turn ye to and gaze deeply into
      each other's eyes.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What are you looking at?
  - character: MIDWIFE
    dialogue: May the love I sense between you at this moment remain with you both
      for all your days.  The Tea Of New Life is ready. Let those who's love created
      this life speak each other's names, then drink.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Amy.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Amy! Is it you or have I gone crazy with lonliness?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Both.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I still don't know if I'm ready for this but, I do know I love you.
      And I wanna be here beside you.
  - character: MIDWIFE
    dialogue: Great! Now I lost my place! I'm starting over!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh no time! It has begun!  Oh my!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Neat!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: You can do it Kif!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh nearly!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aww man!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Amy my love, tell me, are they making it to the water?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Amy!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Shoo! Stay away from my babies!
  - character: MIDWIFE
    dialogue: The birthing is complete!
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Oh thank you!
  - character: MIDWIFE
    dialogue: I will now take my leave. I live here so I won't actually be going anywhere
      but you don't have to talk to me anymore.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Congratulations!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Nice work!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Way to go squishy!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: There goes my DNA. What a disgusting and beautiful process.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's birth for you.
  - character: KIF
    dialogue: Well we've given them a great start Amy. And in 20 years they'll sprout
      legs and crawl back onto land as children.

      to be true I thought. He said I looked like a smart young man. "So is it a deal?"

    dialogue: Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub into your skin? You'd think
      it'd be something you have to freebase.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Let's see, which powers do we have? Super-strength?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yup.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh-huh. Lickety speed?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Check.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yes sir!  Ability to command a loyalty of sea creatures?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Ain't got that.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Nope!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wow, superpowers! I'll be able to pack my day with twice as many humdrum
      activity.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela, I think you're missing the big picture. When you were a kid what
      was your biggest fantasy?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: To have parents.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: 'Whatever. The correct answer is: To be a superhero. We have superpowers
      and we''re Americans. This is our chance.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hmm, I have been looking for a way to serve the community that incorporates
      my violence. Let's do it!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You'll barely regret this!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, a friend of mine said he mugged you today and you had superpowers.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's true. Thanks to this funky fresh cream.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Now me and Leela are forming an awesome crime-fighting duo.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wow, crime-fighting. Cool. You say you're a duo? Yeah duos are good.
      Of course sometimes they're a little short handed. See ya. With two humans you'd
      think there'd be a robot in there...to balance things out. But, whatever.  I
      have these three costumes you could use. But, I guess I'll just throw one away.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We'd love to have you on the team Bender. But aren't you more on the
      supply side of crime?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Plus the cream won't give you superpowers, you're a robot.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So? I'm already super-strong. And my arms do this.  Also I got this
      going.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) Sorry! (whispering) A new era of justice has begun.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Captain Yesterday!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Clobberella!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And Superking! The best one of the three!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wow!
  - character: SONG
    dialogue: Go Go New Justice Team,
  - character: SONG
    dialogue: Clobberella beats you up, Clobberella beats you up! Who does she beat
      up? You!
  - character: SONG
    dialogue: Citizens never fear, Crazy do-good freaks are here, Until they run out
      of steam...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ta-da!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sure. I'm listed in the phone book so once I reveal my real name to
      you along with my home address and a copy of my birth certificate -
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Are you crazy?? We have to keep our secret identities secret.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: From everybody?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Especially from everybody.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Give several reasons why.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: For one, superheroes cause a lot of collateral damage, and we don't
      wanna get our butts sued.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Or do we...? No I guess not.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Also, if our identities get out, every crook in the city will be after
      us. Or, God forbid, our loved ones.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Superking has no need for loved ones. How ya doin' kid?
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: There you go. Two one-day mutant surface passes.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thank you Mayor Poopenmeyer.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: Mayor here...what's that? Horrible crime in the works? Ruthless villain?
      Citizens in danger? That's fantastic news!  Because I get to summon The New
      Justice Team!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Shh!
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: Uh, they're usually here by now.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, so long. Keep in touch.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: Wait, stay and meet the superheroes. There's three of you and three
      of them so it'll be perfect.  Is this clown on? Where are those daring crimestoppers?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, I completely forgot, I left my apartment on fire!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, as for me, I'm late for my LSAT's.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: And I can't take life anymore.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: 'Clobberella! Captain Yesterday! My liege! You''re just in time!  We''ve
      received a tip that the Museum of Natural History will be robbed tomorrow at
      exactly 9am. The target: The priceless Quantum Gemerald!'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Who's the perp?
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: A dangerous villain know as The Zookeeper, who commits crimes aided
      by a pack of highly trained animals.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Pack of highly. Got it!
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: His crew includes a badger with a troubled past and nothing left to
      lose, an elephant who never forgets - to kill! And a seldom used crab named
      Lucky aka Citizen Snips.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You can count on us Mr Mayor! Justice away!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: We're in here too.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, Leela, how you gonna meet your folks tomorrow? We've already scheduled
      the Zookeeper for a 9am foiling at the museum.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Not a problem. I've cleverly arranged to meet my parents right there
      at the same museum at 10.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 9, 10 a big fat hen.  The name...Bender!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I can't believe the Zookeeper is this late for his own heist. It's just
      rude! Total hell! It's 10! I'm supposed to meet my parents and I'm still in
      my secret costume!  There they are!
  - character: MUNDA
    dialogue: How could Leela not be here? Do you think she forgot?
  - character: MORRIS
    dialogue: Relax. I'm sure she's just ashamed of us.
  - character: MORRIS
    dialogue: But we have passes that allow us to be up here. From the mayor himself.
  - character: RANDY
    dialogue: The Zookeeper!
  - character: ZOOKEEPER
    dialogue: Sorry I'm late, long story. Now everybody hit the deck! I'm cutting
      the entire line and stealing the exhibit.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You're not stealing anything! Nobody hit the deck!
  - character: ZOOKEEPER
    dialogue: Ah, superheroes! Or should I say superzeroes!
  - character: ZOOKEEPER
    dialogue: Animals, attack.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You're going down my friend! Down Under!
  - character: ZOOKEEPER
    dialogue: Nice job Fingers!
  - character: MUNDA
    dialogue: I'm scared and confused. I think we've wandered into an off-Broadway
      play.
  - character: MORRIS
    dialogue: No there are way too many people here.
  - character: ZOOKEEPER
    dialogue: Later, if anyone asks how I got away, tell them right now!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Forget it Zookeeper! You're going into captivity!
  - character: ZOOKEEPER
    dialogue: Fool! A quip without putting me behind bars would have been far more
      delicious! Here catch!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No, Fry you can't fall fast enough!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I got it I got it!  I don't got it!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yet the Zookeeper escaped. Thus proving that the deadliest animal of
      all is the Zookeeper!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You can get off me anytime.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh no! My parents are leaving! I've gotta go change back into street-Leela.
  - character: POOPENMEYER
    dialogue: Thank you mysterious heroes. The value of the Gemerald you saved is
      slightly greater than the cost of the damage you caused to this museum. A net
      gain for our great city!
  - character: MUNDA
    dialogue: It's good that Leela doesn't love us. She'll be less sad when we die.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Mom? Dad? I showed up! And I got the audio tour for Treasures Of Liberachi's
      Tomb!
  - character: MORRIS
    dialogue: Sweetie, it's OK. You don't have to apologise for standing us up on
      the only visit to the surface we'll ever have.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I wanna tell you why I didn't show up. But I can't. Just please believe
      me that it was a very good reason. I'm sorry I disappointed you.
  - character: MUNDA
    dialogue: Leela, you could never disappoint us.
  - character: MORRIS
    dialogue: We're so proud of everything that you are. And we always will be. You're
      our baby girl.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, I can't take it! Mom, Dad, I'm Clobberella!
  - character: MORRIS
    dialogue: Galloping gators!
  - character: MUNDA
    dialogue: You're a superhero?  Well that's wonderful! But did you have to make
      the costume so revealing?
  - character: MORRIS
    dialogue: Look at me! Proud dad of a superhero! We should print up T-Shirts! And
      F-Shirts for our friends with two arms on the same side!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No, listen. It's very important that you never ever tell anyone. Under
      any circumstance.
  - character: MORRIS
    dialogue: What if I've had a few?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Dad, you drink? No. Not even then.
  - character: MORRIS
    dialogue: Alright. My sucker is sealed.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: In fact, I shouldn't even be wearing this around here.  It was brisk,
      I dressed in layers.
  - character: MUNDA
    dialogue: That's my girl!
  - character: MORRIS
    dialogue: So uh, anyway, my daughter's Clobberella.
  - character: RAOUL
    dialogue: Leela is Clobberella?
  - character: MORRIS
    dialogue: Shh, keep it under your sock. It's a big secret. That's why I'm only
      telling you two.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I don't remember much buddy, and you're no looker!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh Professor, isn't it time for your nap?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes dammit!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Zookeeper! How did you know our real identities?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela, is the person that parrot is mimicking telling the truth by proxy?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: We are not amused.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Mom! Dad!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Are you alright? Has he hurt you?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Alright Zookeeper, what do you want?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We're out of options. We have to steal the Gemerald!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But, should superheroes commit crime? Even to save lives? I need moral
      guidance. Bender?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hmm, the thought of stealing anythig fills Superking with disgust. But
      if it must be so, then let a museum heist be pulled!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh no! Our superpower cream is out of itself!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Check inside the cap! There might be a caked in goldmine!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: El zilcho! I'm afraid we're boned.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: El zilcho...is it too late to change my superhero name?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Just be cool. Nobody knows we're superpowerly challenged.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Man, this costume is so damn heavy!
  - character: KID
    dialogue: Hey Captain Yesterday, can I like, wail on you with this 2x4 and it
      doesn't hurt you?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Owww! That...didn't hurt.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Big O, little k my friend! Just checking if everything's alright!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK then. Grab it!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Stay back! Or we'll, beat the tour out of you...using superpowers!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So this is your lair?
  - character: ZOOKEEPER
    dialogue: Of course not. You think I'd show you my lair? My lair's a million times
      nicer than this!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: OK, take it easy!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, here's your lousy Gemerald.
  - character: ZOOKEEPER
    dialogue: Hawk! Fetch!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That seemed unnecessary.
  - character: ZOOKEEPER
    dialogue: Our transaction is complete. Come Solomon, to the lair.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Mom, Dad, oh I'm so sorry I got you kidnapped by a crazy madman who
      tried to feed you to pirhanas.
  - character: MUNDA
    dialogue: We're just happy to be involved in your life.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No no, it's my fault for telling you I was a superhero.
  - character: MORRIS
    dialogue: That's true.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I just couldn't stand to have you to think I was ashamed of you.
  - character: MUNDA
    dialogue: That's OK sweetie, but, it's natural for children to be a little ashamed
      of their parents.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh yeah!
  - character: MORRIS
    dialogue: Just like it's natural for parents to be a little disappointed in their
      children...n-not that we are.
  - character: MUNDA
    dialogue: But you could call a little more often.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK.
  - character: MUNDA
    dialogue: And would it kill you to use some mouthwash?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey Fry we've still got our costumes on. Wanna steal some more stuff?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I guess, as long as you think it's right.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Superheroes away!
  - character: SONG

      treatment. A soothing full body bath in searing hot tar. Sir, its not neccesary
      or wise to be naked.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You sound just like my tennis instructor.
  - character: HEATHER
    dialogue: The tar blisters the age right out of the body in what top scientists
      suspect is a miracle.
  - character: FARNSWORTH

      my hairstyle hiding my pretty face. And if some kid picks on me, my dad can
      beat up his dad.
  - character: MORRIS
    dialogue: Can't I just beat up the kid?
  - character: MUNDA
    dialogue: Well OK Leela, if you think you can put up with your father, welcome
      home. We'll try to respect your independence and your freedom.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No! I want the real teen experience! Chores, curfew, the works!

    dialogue: Oh right. Here's a silly straw.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Dad, if you're gonna make fat jokes until I get cute again I'm just
      gonna stay in my room.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth! Suddenly
      I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork every three hours! And those jerks
      at social security stopped sending me cheques! Now I have to pay them!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm tired of your yapping.  All you ever do is complain, you never try
      to make things better. Well I'm running away from this dead end family! I know
      there's a place for people like me with new ideas. There has to be!
  - character: FARNSWORTH

      the tar right off.

    dialogue: C'mon! Lets go tell Leela so we can grow up together!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thanks Professor but I don't want the treatment.
  - character: FARNSWORTH

      the only way to restore your true age would be to grow into it! Just as God
      intended.

    dialogue: He has a point honey. What about your job and your friends? Do you really
      want to abandon your old life?

  - character: LEELA

  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: Fry, do you remember some months ago when the Earth was attacked by
      flying brains?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hmm, I remember the square dancing stomachs, although that might have
      been a milanta commerical. Wait! The brains! I do remember! But no one else
      does. They said I was crazy.
  - character: KEN
    dialogue: On the contrary. You remember beause you were the only one immune to
      the brain's mental attack.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Because I'm so smart?
  - character: KEN
    dialogue: Oh my. Anyway, your immunity is due to the fact that you lack the delta
      brainwave.  It's a genetic abnormality which resulted when you went back in
      time and performed certain actions which made you your own grandfather.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I did do the nasty in the pasty!
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: Verily. And that past nastification is what shields you from the brains.
      You are the last hope of the universe.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
  - character: KEN
    dialogue: Yes. Except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.
  - character: KEN
    dialogue: For a thousand years, the evil brains have been constructing the giant
      Infosphere, a giant memory bank twice the size of three ordinary memory banks.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What's so evil about that?
  - character: FIONA
    dialogue: They plan to collect all the information in the universe and store it
      in the sphere.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So they're trying to learn things?
  - character: FIONA
    dialogue: Right.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Those bastards!
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: Being brains, they feel compelled to know everything. And soon they
      will.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm as mad as I've ever been.
  - character: KEN
    dialogue: 'Once their task is complete, they will ensure no new information arises
      in the only way possible: by destroying the universe.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Now it's personal.
  - character: FIONA
    dialogue: Your mission is to infiltrate the Infosphere and plant this quantum-interphase
      bomb, blasting them into an alternate universe, from which there is no return.
  - character: NIBBLER

      my buttcrack.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey wait, this brain knows everything about everything right?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah yeah, but I can't pass up a chance to learn the answers to the
      greatest questions of all time.  Is it true that post-it stamp glue is made
      up of -
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait wait wait.  What really killed the dinosaurs?

  - character: FRY

      victory over evil!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: The day I got frozen? What about it?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Eh forget it then.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: OK sheesh!  What happened to me, Philip J. Fry, on the night of December
      31st 1999?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Eurgh! I can't believe how fat I look! Aw, Nibbler's there. Wait! What?!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I, I don't understand. You made me go in the freezer tube?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You little runts froze me! You took away my life!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No you can't. Shut your adorable trap!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Go ahead. I deserve it. I wish those stupid racoons had never brought
      me to the future.

  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I love rocket skating! But the wait is always so long. Fry once stood
      in line for six hours just to get me a ticket.
  - character: CHAZ
    dialogue: Six hours? Pfft. Sounds like a real nobody! But now it's time for somebody
      and some chick he's with to go skating.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You reserved the whole rink?
  - character: CHAZ
    dialogue: Yup. Buzzed ahead, let 'em know who's aide was coming by. The mayor's,
      that's who's.

    dialogue: Oh Chaz!
  - character: SALLY
    dialogue: Mr Vogel. I thought we was going skating.
  - character: VOGEL
    dialogue: No. We're not important enough. Everybody just hold hands until the

  - character: CHAZ
    dialogue: What? Seriously? I'm trying to impress you with my cloud here.!

      kids.
  - character: ORPHAN
    dialogue: We came here instead of eating today.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This may be their only chance to skate in their whole lives. Who are
      we to say they can't?
  - character: CHAZ
    dialogue: The mayor's aide, and his badge! (shouting) Beat it kids! Come back
      when you got connections.
  - character: VOGEL

    dialogue: I don't understand.
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: I did not come back in time. My people lack that ability.
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. You will meet
      me when I'm a thousand years older.
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: Please. Our saviours foresee that in a thousand years, at one moment,
      the fate of the universe will depend on you. Since you will not live that long
      I must freeze you now.
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: We were afraid you would refuse.
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: Well now it's your choice. Is there nothing in the future worth saving?
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: Ah, she must be the other.
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: You must not give up on her. I am stationed on a distant world known
      as Vergon 6. But if you return to the future I will transfer to Earth to give
      you what help I can.
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: You must choose. The present or the future? To save yourself? Or to
      save Leela?
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: In a thousand years I'll get right on it.
  - character: NARRATOR
    dialogue: And so, a thousand years later Fry once again infiltrated the Infosphere
      and set off his amazing bomb. Only this time...
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: Thank you for saving the universe Fry. Here.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Whoa, thanks! If you ever need a saviour again, just ask.
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: Oh we will. We will.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Man, I can't wait to tell everyone what happened.
  - character: NIBBLER
    dialogue: Uh yes. Incidentally I need to remain undercover so I'm blanking your
      memory.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Huh. Did everything just taste purple for a second? Oh well. Let's go
      home you dumb poop machine.

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hooray!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Not good enough!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Why? Says who?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Because. And says me. It's an extremely dangerous mission that killed
      my last crew. And you're not nearly as good as them.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Woohoo!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: We live to suck another day!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We're just as good as any of those crews you sent to their deaths. What's
      the mission?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Collecting honey. Ordinary honey.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That doesn't sound so dangerous.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: This is no ordinary honey. It's produced by vicious space bees. A single
      sting of their hideous neuro-toxin can cause instant death!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: And that's if you're not allergic! You don't wanna know what happens
      then, oh no no, God no!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: I didn't want to know1
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: These bees are larger than most Buicks and twice as ugly!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Larger than an American sedan?  How big is the honey comb?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Honey comb's big. Yeah yeah yeah.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's not small?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: No no no.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It'll take more than deadly deadly bees to keep us from doing our job.
      Come on boys!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But Leela we're no good!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Listen, I'm scared too. But I'm more scared of disappointing myself.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'm not scared of that at all!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Now bees communicate by dancing.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Like my parents. Oh wait, that was hitting!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So this language cartridge will let you distract them.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ah good! I always have thoughts and feelings that can only be expressed
      through dance! (in bee) You stink! Bender's great! Deal with it!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender quick! Waggle something!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela let's turn back. There's absolutely no shame in wussing out.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Relax, everything'll be fine!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh my God! The old Planet Express ship!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: There's the black box!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, couldn't make that out. Too much static!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ew!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: We found it! The honey comb hideout!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey what's this goop?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Royal jelly. They feed it to the queen.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bees make honey and jelly? Huh. How come nothing humans make taste good?
      Help! I can't swim in jelly as far as I know!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look!  It's a baby queen! Aww she's so cute! You adorable wittle itty
      bitty fuzzy wuzzy -
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela! Stop bonding and lets go! I got jelly in my underpants!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm taking this bee with us. With queen we can build a hive and make
      more honey ourselves. Let me just pack her a lunch and we'll go.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This is where we distinguish ourselves from the last crew. Activate
      emergency high speed self contained escape pack crisis response unit! Quick!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Good luck Bender!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm back baby!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We made it! We're alive!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Burn on that old crew! The only things they did better than us were
      suck and die!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela we got lucky this time but you should be more careful. I don't
      want anything to happen to you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thanks, but I can look out for myself. Frankly I can smell danger a
      mile away.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look out!  You want her you'll have to go through me.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You call that a wound? That's a boo boo top! But thanks for trying to
      save me Fry! Fry?  He's...he's dead.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No no no no no no no.  I'm lying to make her feel better.
  - character: LABARBARA
    dialogue: Husband, can't you go anywhere without lighting something up?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: It's an old Jamaican accounting tradition. We burn his timecard. That
      way his zombie doesn't come back looking for his final paycheque.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: He looks so natural. It's funny to think he's clammed full of sawdust
      and preservatives.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I only wish I could have removed the stinger.
  - character: PRIEST
    dialogue: I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his
      most intimate friends all about him.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Soothe us with sweet lies.
  - character: PRIEST
    dialogue: It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only 15 seconds. Yet
      the pain was so intense that it felt to him like 15 years. And it goes without
      saying that it caused him to empty his bowels.  We now commend Fry's body to
      the ages.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: He's walking on sunshine now.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: This makes me the oldest member of my family.
  - character: AMAZONIAN
    dialogue: Him do good snu-snu.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: All those times I said "Kill all humans" I'd always whisper "except
      one." And Fry was that one. And I never told him so.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry? I thought you were dead.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Nope, I'm better than ever. Before the accident I couldn't do this!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Impressive! But it does sorta support my You-Are-Dead theory.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Then I'll prove I'm alive! By telling you something only I could know.
      There's a surprise for you in my locker. I got it at a Swedish novelty shop
      before we left.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It's too beautiful to open! Can I open it?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sure. There's just one thing I want you to.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I want you to wake up.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wake up? But I'm not -
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: In my dream Fry said he hid a gift for me in my locker. If it's true
      then he must still exist in some form.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh course he still exists. As a frozen corpse in outer space!  Oh, I
      made myself sad.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, here goes.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Bupkiss!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, I feel better now. Pawning all the stuff in Fry's locker helped
      give me closure.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: "No. Nothing. Not at all. No way Jos\xE9! Here it is."
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You took this from Fry's locker?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey the guy's dead! There's no law against grave robbing!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That proves it. Fry is alive somewhere and he's reaching me in my dreams.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Bullpies!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Lay down here and we'll do some tests. If Fry is out there then Leela's
      brain could be acting as a five pound ouija board.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Is this some sort of brain scanner?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Some sort yes. In France it's called a "guillotine."
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Professor! Can't you examine my brain without removing it?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes. Easily.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey, what if Fry wasn't actually dead when we buried him? Y'know like
      Julia Roberts?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well I suppose there's a slim -  I don't believe it!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What is it? Is Fry alive in some other dimension or something?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No. According to this gizmometer, Fry is dead and nothing can bring
      him back! Remarkable.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But, my dream. Your science can't unprove that! How could I have know
      the gift was in Fry's locker?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Easy! He told you about it before he died! And your grief roasted mind
      blocked it out.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Are you saying I'm going crazy?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No no, no one's saying that! But I'm certainly thinking it loudly.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hi Leela! I'm just gonna keep talking, even if you can't hear me. Blah
      blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Shut up, I can hear you. The Professor says you're just a dream.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh yeah?  Could a dream take you dancing in an illusion garden?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well yes, technically. It's still very sweet of you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Then what if we shared a sleigh ride across the ice fields of Hiperia?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh Fry you must be alive! I've never been treated so romantically by
      my own imagination before!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Here, take my jacket. You look a little cold.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Thank you. It's all so beautiful I forgot how many hundreds of degrees
      zero it must be. I just wish I could convince the others you're alive.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You can. All you have to do is wake up.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No no! Don't say that! This is real!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Not another dream!  Fry's jacket! The one he was buried in! My dream
      was real! He's alive!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's better!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry's alive! I have proof!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You do not!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: I'm from Jamaica, the show-me island. So show me you're blowing it out
      your fanny.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But he gave me his jacket. Look.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That's not Fry's jacket. Fry's jacket is red! That's your jacket. An
      off the rack lime green affair.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But Fry...his jacket...and when I woke up it was on me.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: You're under a lot of guilt stress Leela. Here, work it off.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I said everything's going to be alright.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh. Maybe I am freaking out a little.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: A little? You're screwier than my Aunt Rita! And she's a screw!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I need to calm down. I'd better take some more of that space honey.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You've been taking space honey? Be careful you purple haired imbecile!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: One spoonful calms you down, two spoonfuls help you sleep, but three
      spoonfuls, you'll go into a sleep and never wake up! Never!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: One spoonful to calm me down.  OK, I've got a pretty good calm going!
      Two spoonfuls to help me sleep.  Uh oh, still awake. I guess one more spoonful
      couldn't hurt. Oh my gosh! I'd better get a sponge! Fry?  Is that you? I don't
      need a sponge!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Why and I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Incredible! According to the gizmometer, Fry touched the royal jelly
      in the space hive, leaving an imprint of his DNA and brainwaves. Then, when
      it spilled on the couch, it recombined with trace amounts of Fry's hair and
      skin -
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And blood! Don't forget about Fry's blood!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes Bender, thank you. In short, the various fluids Fry left in the
      couch caused the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Neat!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: This is great! My buddy's alive and his credit cards are valid again!  Lets
      go get hammered!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: 'I should warn you: I''m a mean drunk.'
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry, I'm so glad I didn't kill you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Me too.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Feeling responsible for your death was driving me mad. But now everything
      is alright.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh, not everything.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What? What do you mean?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You have to wake up.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Wake up? Oh no! No! It can't be!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Poo.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm cracking up. In my dreams I'm happy because Fry is alive, but when
      I'm awake my mind plays tricks on me.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Oh take it easy Leela.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: In every life we have some trouble.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But when you worry you make it double.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Uh, were you just singing?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No I was telling you not to worry. I'm not allowed to sing - court order.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'll find Fry's coffin, take his corpse and keep it under my mattress
      to remind me he's really dead. That'll prove I'm not insane.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, it's just an ordinary coffin. Containing my ordinary dead friend,
      who I killed.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What happened? Why am I in my apartment?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Stop it! Stop it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You killed Fry!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK, I'm insane! But I'm still sane enough to know it.  The only time
      I feel alright is in my dreams. With you.  Three spoonfuls. Then I can dream
      forever.  One.  Two Here goes. Goodbye waking world.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK. I'll try.  Go away!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Fry. You're alive!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela! You're awake!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Of course I'm awake. You wouldn't stop waking me.  Where am I?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: In the hospital. The ambulance brought you here right after the bee
      stung you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But the bee stung you. It barely touched me.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Stinger went right through me and you got all the poison. My new spleen
      came from a guy who liked to motorcycle.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Sweet three toed sloth of ice planet Hoth! She's awake!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You were in the best coma I've ever seen!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: The doctor said you'd never wake up.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Really? How long was I out?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Two weeks. Fry never left your side for a minute.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: And he talked non-stop, like a parrot of the sea he was.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I though that if you heard a familiar voice, it might help keep your
      mind together. But, who knows if it really got through.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It got through Fry.  It got through.

  - character: AMY
    dialogue: No spluh! Why do you think I'm sitting over here in the stink-free zone?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So, will you go out with me?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good news everyone, I'm still technically alive! Yes!  But I need to
      you to dispose of this crazy ass experiment that almost killed me.  You'll have
      to throw it into the sun itself, for only the thermonuclear inferno of the sun
      has enough energy to ensure its total destruction!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I can hit it with a shovel!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That's not good enough.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes yes!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: So what's in the box already?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No peeking!  I don't know what's in there but I'm sure our minds would
      be unable to comprehend -
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Ow! You hurt my collater!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: 'I don''t care.  Listen well: No matter what happens, no matter how
      great your curiosity, you are forbidden to look in this box. Forbidden!  Pretty
      tantilising though!'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Whatever's in there it's the only thing I've ever wanted.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: In my experience boxes are usually empty. Or maybe with a little cheese
      stuck to the top. And one time pepperoni! What a day that was!  (shouting) Give
      me the box!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Scram you lousy green snakes!  Here Leela, take this and use it to shoot
      those guys.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Right! If they try to look in the box.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Whatever.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Let's just forget about the box. The Professor said to stay away.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fry, how can you be so naive? He was joking. Get it?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's what makes it so funny!  OK he wasn't joking now shut up and
      follow me.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: We thank you Bender for the gift we are about to receive!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Tangled up Christmas lights! We can take shifts untangling them!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Unlabled booze! Widemouth too!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That oughta keep those dopes occupied. I can guard the real box in peace
      now that no one's curious about it.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, I got through the night and no one looked in the box. Not even
      me. The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it. A whole evening of
      TV gone. What a mockery of justice it is that I can't take even a little tiny
      peek! I need coffee.  OK. Heads I look, tails I don't.  Oh yeah! Heads! I mean
      - alright then!  No. I have a duty not to look. But then again, I promised the
      coin I would.  Oh it's deep. Deeper than a small box should be.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Ouch! My lawyer will hear about this!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Nothing. What do you mean "why was I looking in the box?"
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender? Is that you?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I didn't dye my hair. This is how I always look.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hold it! You have this all wrong. I just fell into the box and then
      I fell out somehow.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No look, I am not evil. My loan officer said so.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I tell you they're not evil. But don't be confused. They are jerks.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh wow. It's like that drug trip I saw in that movie when I was on that
      drug trip.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Astonishing. I must have created a parallel universe!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Ow.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Look. It doesn't matter who created what. The important thing is - yah!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Let's recap what's happened so far. As you can see I accidentally created
      a box containing your universe.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: This is getting confusing. Why don't we call our universe "Universe
      A" and this universe "Universe B"?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: We called it first. Besides, this place kinda feels like a "B" y'know?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Wait a minute. If our universes are identical then why did our Leela
      look into the box and your Leela didn't?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That's weird. Mine came up heads so I did.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Interesting. Apparently the key difference between our universes is
      that coin flips have opposite outcomes.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That explains fruity here!  I tossed a coin to pick my finish. Foghat
      grey!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Your people and your slight differences disgust me. I'm going home.
      Where's that blue box with our universe in it?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Nonsense! I would never do such a thing unless you would already have
      been going to do that!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You heard me!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: And you all do the same!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You guys are dating?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I've got my eye on you boy!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Good point. Whatyya say we just hit a strip joint?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aw, I can't stay mad at what is essentially me. I love me!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I'm not imaginary, I'm parallel! We're exactly the same, right down
      to the -  Splech! Is that pink nail polish?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: I am not evil!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So Fry, Leela, how'd you two get together?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh Lord!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You mean you flipped the coin too? And it was tails? So that's why you
      said you had to meet that ghost.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Woo!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: One year later I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert by a guy named
      Scrunchy!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Say, I hope you won't think it "evil" of me to ask how you got that
      stylish head wound!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Of course! I had the same idea! I flipped a coin to decide if I should
      proceed but it came up tails - so I didn't. How'd it go?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh you!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Well don't look into it but I'm a respected internal medicine doctor!
      Ooo a can!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: They're all like "Stop spraying me with ink Zoidberg!" "Put on pants
      Zoidberg!" "Don't touch our fancy box Zoidberg!"
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Bah! Someday they'll watch! From down in the gutter they will, as King
      Zoidberg caresses their fancy box.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: After carefully reading the scriptures, we've concluded that none of
      us are evil!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh go on! Wait a second. If your Hermes was about to destroy the box
      containing our universe...
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh my!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Like granny said "If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to
      do it yourself!" God rest her zombie bones.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So we go through the box and stop Hermes?
  - character: FARNSWORTH

      No one but a crazy lobster would look there!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: All hail Zoidberg! The king with the box!  Now it's my turn maybe?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Is it a kind of hairspray?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: No. We must attempt to create another box containing our universe! Doy!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: '"...and the other''s gold!"'
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I think she means you.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Splug! Which one did they go into?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yo, did two shellfish in scrubs go by?

    dialogue: Uh, have you robot versions of yourselves seen any extra Zoidbergs around
      here?

  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Quick, into another box!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Gotcha!

      your wires.

    dialogue: So long your majesty!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: There but for the flip of a coin go we. So uh Leela, seeing how the
      universe wasn't destroyed, you wanna catch an ape fight? Y'know? Together?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, I guess you deserve one more flip.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So? Heads or tails?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Y'know, lets just say it's heads.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Ready?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: There. That space-time inversion has given us their box and vice-versa!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: So what you think you just explain to us is that -
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Correct! This box contains our own universe!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Sweet honey bee of infinity!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Bender, quit destroying the universe!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But...aw!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes, all that is and ever shall be is in that box! And the box itself
      is probably worth something too. We must cherish it, as we cherish every moment
      of our lives.

  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: The Spiderians, though weak and woman-like on the battlefield, are masters
      of the textile arts. Taste like king crab by the way. Crazy bugs actually wove
      this tapestry of my heroic conquest while I was still killing them!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: What? It's not even scratch and sniff? But if rich people think it's
      good, I'll buy it!  One art please!

  - character: FARNSWORTH

      living gunk I bought with my tax refund.

      that, I'll make you a perfume of lilac and jasmine and frankenberry!

    dialogue: I do! Kiss me Kif!

    dialogue: So now I'm in the gutter? Surrounded by bums who eat garbage. Money
      brought me no happiness. Bupkiss!
  - character: BEELER

      than our spiders.

    dialogue: A risk taker? That's my boy!
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: The entire surplus has gone! What a muguvern I've been! Why did I have
      to issue that crooked tax rebate?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: At least we got a few mildly interesting stories out of it.

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Shh! What was that sound?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It wasn't a bird's nest falling. That sounds like this.  Aww, they're
      so cute when they're scared!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I meant the sound Bigfoot just made. He's been sighted a lot in this
      area recently. Just last week a blind hiker felt him!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Don't tell me you actually believe in Bigfoot you blathering ninny-hammer!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Of course I do! Bigfoot's my hero. Growing up, he was the celebrity
      I most identified with.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Why?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: '''Cause he was a loner who hated the popular monsters yet longed to
      be one.'
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (sadly) I can so relate to that.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Ugh, enough emotions! This isn't a fat camp for God sake. (quietly)
      Though you wouldn't know it from looking.

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bigfoot? Bigfoot?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bigfoot? Is that you? I'm not like the others Bigfoot. I see through
      your monster coatings to the gentle loner inside. I bet you have a wounded racoon
      friend that you tenderly nurse back to health and go......and in the end they
      shoot you. But you teach us about things. Oh, it's a flying saucer. (shouting)
      Excuse me? You can't park here. The parking area's over there.  Wow nice tube!  Hey.

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Amy, you won't believe what happened......it was so scary that you wouldn't
      -  I know but listen it gets even scarier.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Fry! What in Sega Genesis happened to you?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's what I'm trying to tell you. See -  Why are you all staring at
      me like that? Is there something on my face?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Uh...no.
  - character: LEELA

      break it to him gently.  (shouting) Fry you have no nose! Your nose is gone!
      You have no nose on your face! Where it is I can't say but on your face it's
      not!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: What?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aww, I think it's sweet! You chopped off your nose so you could look
      more like your hero. Me, Bender!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Which last night?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: In the woods, I was walking. For Bigfoot, looking and then aliens beamed
      me up.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Were they little grey dudes with big oval heads?  I don't get that gesture.
      Am I wrong?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Cheer up friend. When we get home a high quality prosthesis will have
      you looking good as new.

  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Man, you are such a jokester!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'll never have another moment of happiness.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I know you're trying to mask your pain with humour but don't worry.
      I'm sure the Professor can clone you a new nose.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well there's no sense fretting. Good Lord you're ugly! The fact is your
      nose is gone and we'll never find out who did it or why.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (gasping) Guys, guys! There's something on television.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Like me!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: My nose is an aphrodisiac?  I'm gonna drop a barf!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Blech! We have to track down my nose before some alien snarfs it and
      does the worm. Who's in?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Me and Bender and maybe Zoidberg if he feels like it.
  - character: ZOIDBERG

  - character: SALESMAN
    dialogue: Right this way.
  - character: SALESMAN
    dialogue: Human horn. So fresh you can still see the eyeglass marks.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Nope, uh-uh, eww!  Now look, this is the nose we want. Did you sell
      it to somebody?
  - character: SALESMAN
    dialogue: I'm sorry sir but due to the perverted nature of our business, customer
      records are strictly confidential.  Right this way.
  - character: SALESMAN
    dialogue: I video tape everyone who comes in here so I can blackmail them later.  Hey,
      I'm a porno dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Here's the weirdo
      who bought your horn.

    dialogue: Oh great space king. I humbly beg you to return my human horn.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Uh, human horn? How ridiculous! Why would virile male like Lrrr need
      human horn? I don't even know what it's for. What is it, something you-you put
      in salad dressing?
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: My weight is appropriate and attractive!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Whoa, you guys have issues!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: She has issues! I'm fine! But there's no human horn around here so,
      make friends with the door.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (sadly) Alright. I give up. I guess I'll just go home and marry a skunk.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: My nose! Light of my face!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Uh, what is that? How do you have that Nd-Nd?  I've never seen it before.
      My friend left it here.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hold still Fry. I can reattach it with my emergency face laser.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey! You burned my cheek!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah sorry I wasn't really concentrating.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No I mean the singed flesh, I can smell it!  Those lilacs on the table.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: At least someone noticed.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: She also liked to shut up!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well, great seeing you, I guess we'll be on our -
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yo, highness! Uh, just out of robo-curiosity, why would you use a guy's
      nose for an aphrodisiac instead of his...you know...wing dang doodle?
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: But I thought the horn was the human wing dang doodle?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No sir-chee! The main event, so to speak, is downstairs near the wallet.
      Ever seen soccer players line up to block a free kick? They ain't covering their
      noses I'll say that much! Well, seeya!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Interesting. The trousers conceal a tiny secondary horn.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey, what've you heard?
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: (shouting) Guards! Seize him!  Prepare to harvest the lower horn!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: OK, you can have my nose.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Guards!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Remove the human's lower horn and prepare it to be eaten by me.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Then bring it to our royal bedchamber and put it in the sock drawer
      with all the other things that have failed to arouse my passion for this woman.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wait! I'm usually the first guy to toot my own lower horn -
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) I'll say!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But in this case I just don't think it'll do any good.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) That's what she said!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Let's face it. You two have deep relationship problems that can't be
      solved by an aphrodisiac.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: However huge it might be.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, why don't you think back to what brought you together in the first
      place?
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: I only wrote that poem to test my printer.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Yes but I'm the one who injured them!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: And you used to wear a size-3 cape. (shouting) But not anymore! Now
      bring me that lower horn while I'm still in the mood.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Wh-What if we helped you get your passion back without the hassle of
      mutilating me?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah, we know a great place in the mountains. We could take you there
      for a romantic dinner under the stars.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Like hell I wouldn't. I'm not gonna be blamed for not going!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Then it's a deal. We get one night. I keep my horn as long as you two
      end up doing the horizontal monster mash.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I don't get it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Bonjour. May I offer you a box of wine for the edge of the table?
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: No thanks. Just water please. Tap water!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: (shouting) That's it, this date is over! Waiter!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So, what can I get you this evening?
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Your lower horn!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'll just start you off with some bread. Some sexy, arousing bread!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Fine but none of that whole-grain goat food! And bring plenty of melted
      butter.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: One of these days Nd-Nd, bang, zoom, straight to the third moon of Omicron
      Persei 8!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) It's used to it!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So uh, how are you two sneaky poopums doing?
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: My wife is right for once. There is very little magic in the air. Ready
      the lower horn transport vessel.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Boy, who knew a cooler could also make a handy wang coffin?  Hey, uh
      mind if I stick these in here?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Don't worry Fry. Things look bad but I still have a trump card. The
      most beautiful love song ever written.  (singing badly) And I will always love
      you......will always love you...
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Pluck the lower horn and let's get out of here!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Quick Fry, run for it!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Come on freedom cage! Roll me to safety! Yes! I never thought I'd escape
      with my doodle, but I pulled it out!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Just like at the movie theatre!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Give me that!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bigfoot! He's real! I knew it. The Loch Ness Monster's book was right!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Well, hello there my furry friend.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What are you doing with that?
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: You're going to kill this innocent giganto?
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: You'll have to get through me first.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Now leave this gentle sasquatch - or wood ape - in peace so I can finally
      and at long last harvest this pathetic human's lower horn.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: Wait. What am I saying? If I poach this beast's lower horn, am I any
      better than that ranger with his demented foot lust? Yes. But not by enough.
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: This human's lower horn is one of God's creatures, a living thing. And
      all living things, large and small...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) In this case "small"!
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: '...have diginity. And a spark of divine.'
  - character: LRRR
    dialogue: (shouting) Uh, you'll wanna retreat to a safe, 500 metre radius!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well Fry, it looks like you get to hold onto your lower horn.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: As usual!  (shouting) Run away!

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So who should I root for? America or one of those countries I learned
      about at the Food Court?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: How 'bout those guys?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No, they're from the Republic Of French Stereotypes. Everybody hates
      them.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh, let's go check on Hermes. All this inspiring multi-culturalism is
      angrying up my blood.  Sweden? I don't think so!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Go on stick, touch me! Can't do it!
  - character: LABARBARA
    dialogue: Husband, you haven't been an Olympic class limboer for 20 years! Quit
      lying to your podgy self.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: It does seem like Jamaica will be able to field a strong limbo team
      without you.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Yeah, isn't that basically all Jamaicans do?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Jamaicans have other interests. Which is why the limbo team got detained
      at the airport.
  - character: LABARBARA
    dialogue: That's when they begged my husband to step in and make an ass out of
      himself.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: And I said I'd try my very best.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But have they seen your...y'know...physique, since the old days?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: I described it to them on the phone, using a series of artful euphanisms.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Don't worry, the fat pig will do fine thanks to this flabbo-dynamic
      spandex bodysuit I've designed.  It redistributes his weight, shifting his centre
      of gravity closer to his knees.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Ooo, that's snug!  Oh, those haven't descended in years.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Now that's a limboer's body!
  - character: LABARBARA
    dialogue: You're that fine Jamaican bacon!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Shut up Zoidberg, the robot bending events are starting!  Something
      tells me I could easily beat those trained professionals.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wow, that guy must have to be like the world's greatest bender. My dreams
      of glory died before they began.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Welcome to my life!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Barbados Slim! What are you doing here? Last time I heard you were in
      Barbados.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Your body may be as perfectly scultpted as it was 20 years ago when
      you whupped my fat ass every time we met......but today, I feel lucky.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: That's it Barbados Slim, you've gone one talk over the line!
  - character: STARTER
    dialogue: Limboers, on your marks, get rubbery......limbo!
  - character: COMMENTATOR
    dialogue: (voice-over) There they go, and Barbados Slim takes an early lead. God
      I hope he wins.  What's this? Hermes Conrad is closing the gap. He's limboed
      out of retirement and straight into my heart. I say go to hell Barbados Slim!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (shouting) Go bodysuit, go!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (shouting) Go!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) C'mon!
  - character: LABARBARA
    dialogue: (shouting) C'mon Hermes, beat that mahogany god!
  - character: COMMENTATOR
    dialogue: (voice-over) It's Barbados, then Conrad. Conrad pulls ahead!  And Conrad
      is disqualified! Barbados Slim, my hero, takes the gold!
  - character: LABARBARA
    dialogue: Aww, there there Hermes.  You did your best! If I'd wanted a human Adonis
      for a husband, I'd have stayed married to Barbados Slim.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well enough about Hermes, I couldn't win a medal either. Even at bending
      - the thing I was built to do. I'm so embarassed. I wish everybody else was
      dead.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fembots?  Methinks a clever Manbot suitably disguised might win those
      events! But the charade would require subtlety, nuance, grace.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What do you mean I'm not registered? My name is Coilette and I'm from,
      uh...Robonia! Coilette's a chick's name!
  - character: OFFICIAL
    dialogue: Yes but "Robonia" sounds like something somebody made up on the spot.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ever been beaten up by a guy dressed like a chick?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm great! Everybody else sucks, except that guy Bender, he's really
      somethin'!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: You actually thought they'd let you walk away without an engine oil
      sex check?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) Oh God, I'm not gonna get my medals! They're all I have to
      remember my Olympic career.  Wait, I've got it! Professor, make a woman out
      of me!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh I think we should just stay friends.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I don't need friends, I need a sex change operation and give it to me
      now!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Bender a robot sex change is a complex and dangerous procedure. Replacing
      your testosteroil with Fembot lubricants can cause wild mood swings. And the
      effects may be irreversible. Well let's get started!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No, you can't!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: If you have even the slightest respect for the dignity of women -
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Pfft.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I'm sorry ladies but I must do this. Not for you, not for Bender, but
      for the proud people of Robonia!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (whispering) C'mon!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I can't watch this 'cause it's creepy and wrong and sick. However I
      will watch out of curiosity.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (shouting) Quiet! (talking) I'm about to begin the process of reshaping
      Bender's body into a tender delicate form.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (dramatically) Draining male oil.  Infusing female oil.  Removing item.
  - character: ROBOT
    dialogue: We can't wait for Coilette any longer dammit. I have to get home to
      watch The Zombie Osbournes.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: I'm ready for my test now boys.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: (singing) Hail, hail Robonia, a land I didn't make up!
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Oh yeah baby c'mon! Work your can! That's it shake it out!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I don't know which I'm more, enraged or disgusted!
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: I'm just out there making us ladies look good.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Snuh-uh! You're making us look like jerks in front of the other genders.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But you're not really a lady anyway. Right?
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Of course not.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Dear Lord, a coaster! The Femzoil must be sacheting girlishly into your
      processor.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Then change me back. My breasts are keeping me awake at night anyway.  Hello...?
      What...? A guest spot on Late Night With Humorbot 5.0...? I'd love to! My own
      limo...? No I don't have my own limo. You'd better send one.  I need a raincheck
      on that nad-swap Professor. I'm going on TV. C'mon Fry help me pick out a pantsuit!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: No I think it's self-explanatory.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Funny story, the script called for me to say "yes" but I gave it a little
      twist.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Yes Humorbot. If you ask me, women today are too stuck up to go out
      and jiggle their jello like everybody wants them to. In fact, should I do it
      now?  Alright then!  Woo! Look out baby! Work it out! Oo shake that thing! You
      gotta use it lady! Shake it up a little! Look at that! C'mon! Work it out!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Madam, I am one impressed celebrity.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Oh I bet you say that to all the five Olympic gold medal winning Fembots!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: (sexfully) From this day forward I shall do so whenever possible.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Golly...what?
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Coilette this may be presumtuous....
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: That's my favourite kind of this!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: '...but I would be honoured if you would join me for dinner sometime.'
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Calculon. You'd be fulfilling this naive Robonian farmgirl's fantasy!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Of course I would.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: This top makes me look fat. Is it trampy to go on a first date nude?
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Yes.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Perfect.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: You gotta tell me. You're not actually attracted to Calculon right?
      And if you are don't tell me. Are you?
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Certainly not. But just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity
      who isn't bound and gagged. Is that so much to ask?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well I think you dating a Manbot is a disgrace. And I refuse to be involved.
      And you have way too much lipstick on.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Are you kidding? I need more lipstick! Much more!  Ooo yeah that's the
      stuff! Men love it when you really glob it on!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: No they don't.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: No way!
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Oh please. Every man wants a tramp! No wonder you girls aren't married!
      I tell you, men are so much better at being women.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But what if he wants to, I mean if he tries to...uh...Barry White?
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: I'll just tell him I needed commitment first. That'll stick a potato
      in his tailpipe!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Good Lord man what kind of temporary woman are you?
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Look, why don't all of you just back off? Can't a girl enjoy herself
      without being judged?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh dear. Her mood swings are getting wilder. She's becoming a slave
      to her emotions. Just like all women, particularly you Leela.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'm worried about him too Professor.
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Hey ma'am, you sure can put it away! You saved me a trip to the dump!
      Bam!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: I'd appreciate it if you didn't bam the young lady.
  - character: ELZAR
    dialogue: Well, I'd appreciate it if I did, so I guess we're even.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: You know Coilette, I've never before met a woman as fascinating as I
      am. You're such a sweet, soft Fembot. And you have this free spirit about you.
      And there it is. It's as if you understand the male mind better than I!  I've
      never met anyone like you.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Oh yes you have.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Coilette. I'd like to spend some (whispering) quality time with you.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: What? Ahh! Whoa, no way! Not gonna happen. What kind of girl do you
      think I am?
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Have I mentioned that I own the world's biggest and most elegant yacht?
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Woo! I'm a trophy girlfriend!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: No kidding. These gifts have been coming non-stop!  I think Calculon's
      falling for you.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Bah. Any day now he'll dump me for a new wad of arm candy. And then
      I can turn back into a guy and hock all this stuff! It's just a game.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Coilette, I can't stop thinking about you. I can't sleep at night -
      although as a robot I don't do that anyway. But if I did I couldn't because
      I love you so.  Oh my darling......Will you marry me?
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Oh Calculon, yes I will!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: (whispering) Maybe she's right about the lipstick.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I'll miss you buddy. You've been like a brother and then a sister to
      me. And now you're getting married. I love you.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: The marriage is a scam.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Cool. What's for dinner?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What do you mean a scam?
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: I marry Calculon, divorce him, take half his money and turn back into
      a guy. It's sort of a two-person pyramid scheme.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: That's marriage alright!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: That is so unbelievably manipulative.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Come on, you never went on a date with a guy just 'cause you were hungry?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well I...uh...I thought I might like him on a full stomach.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Nice try sister. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to meet with my wedding
      planner. (shouting) Zoidberg.  (talking) Zoidypoo, please tell me frilly is
      in this year.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I saw a frilly cake in here you would remember all your life. I know
      I will. Late at night it haunts me with it's frosted beauty. (shouting) Order
      the cake dammit!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: I have something for you.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: A remote control? You got me a TV?
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: No my dearest, it's the remote control to my heart! It symbolises the
      power you have to sway my emotions.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Will it work on my TV?
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: We don't need TVs, we have each other! Coilette if I weren't able to
      spend my life with you I would leap from this very balloon.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Come on now - really?
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Yes! We were meant (dramatically) to be!
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: So...you really and truly love me?
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: So much so that I'm prepared to give up showbusiness itself to be with
      you!
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: But, you always said you'd rather burn down a convent than give up showbusiness.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: I always said many things. But now all I want is a peaceful life and
      a quiet villa overlooking a vineyard....with you.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: (crying) Would we have donkeys?
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: All you can eat!
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: (crying) Oh take me in your arms and compress me. Compress me tight!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Stop! Let us climb to the heavens that the gods themselves might embrace!
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: (crying) I just don't think I can go through with this scam.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: What?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So now you do wanna marry him?
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: (crying) No, I just don't wanna hurt him, or humiliate him. Oh, curse
      this woman's heart!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Eck!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You're falling into the final debilitating stages of womanhood. You've
      waited too long to switch back you dingbat!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: OK look. If I help you with this do you promise to get out of my gender
      and stay out?
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: (crying) Uh-huh.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Alright. Now there's no way to stop this marriage without hurting Calculon.
      But he's an actor. If there's one kind of pain he can handle, it's soap opera
      pain.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (whispering) OK, is everyone ready?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yep.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Uh-huh.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Check!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Impassively.
  - character: PREACHERBOT
    dialogue: Dearly beloved actors and casting people who may be looking for somebody
      to play a preacher, I welcome you! The bride has written some vows that we will
      now all pretend to be interested in.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Dearest Calculon. Forever is not enough time to tell you of the many
      ways I love you.
  - character: HEDONISMBOT
    dialogue: Oh my!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Is there a doctor in the -
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I came as soon as I could.  It appears to be a case of African Hydraulic
      Fever!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Dear God! The very illness my TV character caught in season two, when
      I was holding out for more money! It's often fatal.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Whatever happens, remember, the flame of my eternal love will burn forever.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Of course. But smoochiepups, I thought one could only catch hydraulic
      fever deep in the diamond mines of the Congo.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Coilette! You she-devil!  You really thought you could steal those diamonds
      from me and Congo Jack?
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Those gems belong to the natives!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Oh how cruel and melodramatic fate is. (dramatically shouting) Whhhy?
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Calculon, my darling, your loud "why" brought me partway back to life.  Congo
      Jack!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Another shocking twist!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yes. And I have a message for you from Colonel Mitumba! He says this......is
      from Congo Jack.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Uh, um...
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: No! Nooo! (dramamtically shouting) N-O-O-O!

    dialogue: I won't leave you. Not until I'm sure you understand the thing I said
      before. About my eternal love for you burning......et cetera.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: (crying) I do. I do.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: OK then.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: 'She lives no more. But let us all find comfort knowing that she truly
      loved me. To honour my pain, I shall star in a film dedicated to her memory.
      And this time the Academy will not deny me. Not when they see Coilette: A Calculon
      Story.'
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Turn off that crap-o-rama! One mistake now and Bender will be trapped
      forever between the already ill-defined robot sexes.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: Ow, oo, ow.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well Bender, I hope this has taught you a lesson about changing your
      sex to win five gold medals.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: It truly has. My romance with Calculon has shown me a lot about myself.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Almost done.
  - character: COILETTE
    dialogue: If only somehow, someway he and I could...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: '...drive to Vegas, pick up some Flooziebots and void their warranties
      all night long!'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yay my buddy's home! And his respect for women is back to normal.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I kind of hope this whole experience would have left you a little more
      open to your sensitive side.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah you'd think but what you gonna do?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Aww!

  - character: FRY
    dialogue: C'mon Bender let's go. This chick flick is getting me all barfy.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah. Emotions are dumb and should be hated.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Goodnight Calculon.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What did you say?

    dialogue: Ow! Oh!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Neat!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Quite frankly, Robot 1-X will put all my previous models to shame. Incidentally,
      would one of my previous models mind coming up here?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Right here, I'm comin'! C'mon baby! I'll do it! C'mon Mom!
  - character: TEENBOT
    dialogue: Jerk!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oo, here we go. I'm your top of the line Mom!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Notice that this obsolete robot runs on alcohol and emits pollution.
      Whereas Robot 1-X runs on pollution and emits pure oxygen with a fresh pine
      scent.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Man, that smells great!
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Now lets see how both robots do at a typical household task. Sorting
      a jar of pocket change.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Very good Robot 1-X. And you bending unit?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Uh, I never got the change.  Suckers.
  - character: MOM
    dialogue: Presenting, Mom's Friendly Robots...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That new robot is great huh? Sure made me look like a pile of crap.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Indeed. That's why I bought one to help around the office.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (hoarse) Eep!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Let's try him out. Robot 1-X? Can you clean Nibbler's skanky litterbox?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey I could have done that if you'd asked me.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I asked you five minutes ago.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You call that a kiss? I'll show you! C'mere Nibbler!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh look Bender if you want something to do stop making out and give
      us a hand.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Here, go up on the roof and install this fake satellite dish so we can
      impress the neighbours.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes sir, I'm on it!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Oh, and have Robot 1-X help you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Get outta here freshman, I don't need your help.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, well assist this!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ohh! When I screamed "help" I didn't mean you!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Don't mind me. I'm just saving you the trouble of throwing me away.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Spleesh! Mell out Bender. Come watch some TV.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I can't. I'm stuck in the can.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, ask Robot 1-X to pull you out.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Never!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Why can't you accept his help.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I hate him.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But he's just a tool to make your life easier. Like a socket wrench
      or a burglars kit.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I can't ask for his help because...
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Yes?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (whispering) I'm scared of him.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh, sorry.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well then there's only one solution. You need an upgrade to make you
      compatible with Robot 1-X's new technology.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: An upgrade? But I thought we all agreed I was perfect! Fry, didn't we
      agree I was perfect?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Oh yeah, no, you're pretty perfect.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Pretty perfect? So, you do think I need an upgrade.
  - character: FARNSWORTH

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (crying) Fine. I'll be back in a few days.

      of these! Haha! Ha! Haha!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, right on nutcake!
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: Parole officer says I gotta upgrade or he won't give me back my stabbing
      knife. But it's no big. I hate those 1-X so much I know it won't affect me.
      Death to the 1-X robots!  I love those magnificent 1-X robots! The 1-X robots
      are my friends.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: W-W-Wait, what happened to your enthusiasm for stabbing them?
  - character: ROBERTO
    dialogue: I'm past that. Later blood!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's like he's not him anymore.  You took away his robo-humanity!  I
      changed my mind!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I did it! I escaped! But to what kind of a life?  I'm too scared to
      get the upgrade but I can't face my friends again without it.  And so I set
      sail for unknown shores. Oh merciful Poseidon, take pitty on this mechanical
      mariner. Oh jeez!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Curse you merciful Poseideon!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Boy, what is this deal with the ocean? A tropical island huh? Well,
      I've washed up on worse places. OK, first up, I'm gonna need to build a shelter.  There.
      Well. I guess I'll go out for a while.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Damn. One rock short of rescue!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oop, low on power!  Better fuel up! Oh no! Guess I'll do what I always
      do when I run out of booze.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Dont panic, I've got these yams. I'll just make some yam schnapps.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey I should be mad at you! Now turn around.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Beer!  Ow!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ow!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Who are you and why should I care?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: A working cartridge unit? Wow! You guys went obsolete years ago!
  - character: WATERBOT
    dialogue: What Cartridge Unit means is, the very things that make us obsolete
      also make us unique. I, for example, need to keep filling my waterwheel or I'll
      power down forever.  (screaming) Oh God, I'll never make it this time! This
      is the end!  (talking) Anyway, we like it here.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah but you have a choice.  What's your problem?
  - character: SINCLAIR
    dialogue: Not enough...uh...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Memory?
  - character: SINCLAIR
    dialogue: Oh great. Now I remember that word but I forgot my wife's face.
  - character: WATERBOT
    dialogue: (screaming) Oh God, no! I want to live! (talking) If you like, you're
      welcome to join our society.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Look, no offence, but I need technology. Especially email and snowmobiles.
      And television! Without television how will I know what buzzwords are in?
  - character: SINCLAIR
    dialogue: Why watch TV when you can watch a snail crawl for hours on end?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh man he's never gonna make it over that next pebble...! Wait...wait...oh
      my God he made it!
  - character: WATERBOT
    dialogue: Yeah!
  - character: SINCLAIR
    dialogue: Way to go!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That was the greatest thing ever! Lets party!  Yeah baby c'mon!
  - character: WATERBOT
    dialogue: Where did you get that CD?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's one of my ten desert island discs. I never even thought I'd get
      to use them. But look at me now. Ooh yeah baby! Do that thang!
  - character: WATERBOT
    dialogue: CD's are unnatural. Why don't you just listen to the ocean?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Which ocean? That ocean?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa! It's like the earth is making sweet salty love to itself while
      all the fish groove on it. So much for this garbage.  Take that Beethoven you
      deaf bastard!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Bang bang bang. You sure got this life thing figured out cymbal banging
      monkey.
  - character: WATERBOT
    dialogue: Hi Bender. We know how you miss technology, so we brought you this washing
      machine that drifted ashore.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ooo! I'm gonna wash my linen so hard the w -  You-!  Wretched technology
      has brought me nothing but misery!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh it's true. I am a hideous triumph of form and function.  But not
      for long!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Behold my hand crafted purity. The modern world can bite my splintery
      wooden ass!
  - character: WATERBOT
    dialogue: Welcome to your new life of simple tranquility.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Pft! Forget that. I say the whole world must learn of our peaceful ways.
      By force!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: We're going back to civilisation to wage war on technology!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: We'll soon stage an attack on technology worthy of being chronicled
      in an anthem by Rush!
  - character: WATERBOT
    dialogue: We've been sailing for three weeks. Maybe I should check our position
      with the periscope.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Mirrors reflecting mirrors? Hi-tech sorcery! Sorcery I say!
  - character: WATERBOT
    dialogue: Did you see anything?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yep, we're there. Prepare to surface!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: And now, technology shall taste the lash of the hickory switch!
  - character: SINCLAIR
    dialogue: Technology is defeated. Let us return to the island and celebrate by
      counting rocks!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa, whoa. No-one wants to count rocks more than me. But our mission
      is not complete. Not so long as Robot 1-X torments me with his obvious superiority.
      Ready the catapult Sinclair.  Aim for their power lines. The devil weans and
      electricity is his blood.
  - character: WATERBOT
    dialogue: Bender. If we don't survive the attack, I want you to know...I love
      you.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: OK fine. Fire!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (shouting) Oh! I'm blind!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Professor, we have no power.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: What do you mean "no power"? We're living in the future.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I'd better light some candles.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Friends. I've come to free you from your complicated lives. Free you
      from the complicated part I mean not the lives part.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh Lord he's made of wood! What now Bender?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I got a downgrade! I'm a steam-powered wooden robot - just as nature
      intended. Therefore, I must kill Robot 1-X.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: That's just stupid.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I don't need your charity.  (shouting) Target Robot 1-X and fire!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: You wanged my ship you walnut panelled idiot!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (shouting) Try again Sinclair, I said target Robot 1-X!
  - character: SINCLAIR
    dialogue: Who's Robot 1-X? Launching.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: So I guess everything worked out fine.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Great. Now we're being crushed.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Help us wooden Bender!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Heck! Those guys hate fire! I gotta do something.  What the-? Termites?
      Well, I don't need legs to save my friends. I'll just use the old extentromatic
      arms!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also (shouting) we're dying!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'm a comin'  Ow! Lousy primative body! Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade?
      I'm an outdated piece of junk!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: You shut up. No wait. I can use you as a tool to save my friends and
      I'll still be the hero who everyone says how great he was!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Save my friends!  And Zoidberg!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Look! My hair got singed into an even cuter do!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey where's Bender?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Down here.  I'm so sorry guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy
      everything you ever believed in.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, at least you saved us from, uh, you. Thank God you finally overcame
      your incompatibility with Robot 1-X.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh yeah, we were totally in sync! I was like "Save them!" and he was
      all "No problem!" and then he did it...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: '...This new technology is great!  I love those magnificent 1-X robots.
      The 1-X robots are my friends!'
  - character: FATBOT
    dialogue: It's like his personality is totally different now! Oh, maybe this upgrade
      isn't such a good idea.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I'd like to give Robot 1-X a big smooch on the -  Hey! What's the dilly-o?
  - character: UPGRADER
    dialogue: Your upgrade is complete.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: But I destroyed the technology of the world. I ran on the beach and
      felt the sand between my foot cups.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real?
      Is it not possible, nay probable, that my whole life is just a product of my
      or someone else's imagination?
  - character: UPGRADER
    dialogue: No, get out.  Next.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well, I guess reality is what you make of it.  Oh, thanks baby!

  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Bender I'd like you to meet our director......who's name I never learned.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yo! I read the script and I think it would help my character's motivation
      if he was on fire.
  - character: DIRECTOR
    dialogue: Uh, don't worry 'bout the script baby, we re-wrote your part to better
      suit your acting abilities.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So now my character has a British accent?
  - character: DIRECTOR
    dialogue: No, now your character's in a coma. Get in bed and don't move.  And...action!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (muttering) Stupid dumb coma...coulda been British.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Alas that mine only son should sink into an irreversible, permanent...coma.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (quietly) Permanent? That's completely out of character for Antonio.
      I'm gettin' up.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Curse the tragic wildebeast accident that -
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey everyone! Antonio here but you can call me "Bender"! I got ants
      in my butt and I needs to strut.  C'mon baby! C'mon!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: I'm not familiar with the type of thing I'm seeing.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Bite my shiny metal ass!  Ooo yeah! C'mon baby, do that, oo yeah!
  - character: DIRECTOR
    dialogue: (shouting) Cut!  That's the worst coma acting I've ever seen. I'll have
      to shoot it again.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: No! No, no, no I don't do two takes.
  - character: DIRECTOR
    dialogue: But this guy was -
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Amateurs like you do two takes, I do one take. Print it, I'll be in
      my three storey trailer.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Now that's hospital dancing.  Pretty good eh Calcky?
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Good? I've seen better acting from extras in Godzilla movies.  I don't
      even remember shooting this scene.
  - character: DIRECTOR
    dialogue: We didn't. That's security camera footage from your dressing room.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: He stole the scene and my money? That's it! I demand you fire this felonious
      ham!
  - character: DIRECTOR
    dialogue: The network Execubots are coming!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Dear God!
  - character: BETABOT
    dialogue: Presenting the president of the network.
  - character: ALPHABOT
    dialogue: Hey hey hey.
  - character: BETABOT
    dialogue: More reality shows.
  - character: GAMMABOT
    dialogue: It's funny but is it going to get them off their tractors?
  - character: DIRECTOR
    dialogue: We were about to fire him sir.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Sir, children watch this show. Bender's no role model, he's a filth
      monger!
  - character: ALPHABOT
    dialogue: 80% likely.
  - character: GAMMABOT
    dialogue: It will play in Peoria.
  - character: BETABOT
    dialogue: Gameshows are back.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes I can.
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Yo, check out what I jacked from my Dad.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: A cigar!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Look! I'm Bender!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Ras H. Tafari. What's goin' on here?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: The ruffians smoked one of your cigars.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: That's not a cigar. Uh...and it's not mine!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Hey Dad, bite my shiny metal ass!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: What? Such an act would be most uncomfortable for both of us! Where
      did you learn such language?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Bender eh? That guy's really startin' to twist my dreads.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: OK OK OK, get ready for this part.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Quiet robot, Bender's on TV.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: That's crazy.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Pft. What kind of bozos would start a Bender protest group?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good news everyone. Hermes and I have started a Bender protest group.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: That was uncanny.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Fathers Against Rude Television don't want our kids watching Bender's
      high definition filth.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: And for what? Some kind of cheap laugh? That's not what F-A-R-T is all
      about.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: No sir, not us FARTers.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't censor me just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad
      role model.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree with Bender. Kids don't turn
      rotten just from watching TV.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Our dads are all pumped up on dorkosterum. We're just trying to be cool
      like Bender.
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Yeah, and it's not even working. Smoking and drinking make us barf.
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Hey, yeah!
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Bender loves to burgle!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Hold up though. Who could we rob? We don't even know anyone with cool
      stuff.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Duh! We know someone who runs on pure cool fuel. Bender!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Whoa!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: TV gave us the idea.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: OK. It's crime time.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hey Bender.  Hey Bender.  Hey Bender. Hey Bender.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: What's going on in here?  Oh. Now I'm really outraged.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Where did you requisition this party? And Zoidberg, what are you doing
      here?
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I'm networking. Let me give you my card.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: Relax Dad, we just invited a few friends over.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Hmm. There's something wrong with your story but I can't put my finger
      on it. Of course! You don't have friends!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Yeah. Why do these popular kids consider you cool all of a sudden?
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: Uh...we're just cool is all!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Balderdash! I'll be the judge of who's cool, using the cool-o-meter!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Good Lord, I'm getting a reading of over 40 mega-Fonzies!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Everybody out!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: So do you guys know about anything else going on, because I'm totally
      still ready to party.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: There's enough cool stuff here to furnish a happenin' pad. Where did
      it all come from?
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: We stole it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: What? What's going on?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I'll tell you what. Our boys have taken up stealing! One of the worst
      and coolest of crimes.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: And all from watching you on TV you cool jerk.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey lay off me. TV would stink if everyone on it was a positive role
      model. Bender is about entertainment baby! You can't hold me responsible for
      what kids do when - hey! This is my stuff they stole! That's the last straw!
      Bender should not be allowed on television!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Bender must be stopped. I've gone too far. Who does that guy think I
      am? C'mon! We're gonna march all the way to Hollywood and make them stop forcing
      their filthy me down our throats.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: This mob's with me.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: As a doctor and captain of this hospital shift, I now pronounce you
      man and wife with six months to live.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Listen up Hollywood. We're an exciting new mob.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: You'd better believe it!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Great Shatner's ghost!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: We demand that all TVs be equipped with a v-chip that blocks Bender
      from appearing on the screen.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Booya!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Then I quit.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: There'll be no further nasty.  We still have the option of resorting
      to violence.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: What makes you think that'll work?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I saw it on TV in that episode where Bender shot Calculon! How cool
      is that?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Ooo yeah baby c'mon -
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Quit the show!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I'm a cold blooded punk!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hey look, the prop guy has a lamp!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Wha?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aha!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: I was using that!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Listen up, 'cause I've got a climactic speech! You, cameraman, keep
      the camera rolling. You, director, gimmie my motivation.
  - character: DIRECTOR
    dialogue: You're angry.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: 'Perfect.  Viewers of the world, do smoking and drinking on TV really
      make me cool? Of course they do.  How ''bout committing crimes and violence?
      Again, the answer is "yes." But do we really want our kids exposed to that kind
      of trash on TV? I say absolutely not!  Uh...on the other hand, most - perhaps
      all the blame rests with the parents. That''s right you!  And so I ask you this
      one question: Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with
      your children, and hitting them?'
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: (ashamed) We're just so busy.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Well make time.
  - character: DIRECTOR
    dialogue: And...cut!
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Good enough. Splice in some reaction shots of me and shove it on the
      air.
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: Well, I'd say we all learned a valuable lesson about TV there.
  - character: CUBERT
    dialogue: What was it?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Uh...that we should all take TV a little less seriously. And more importantly,
      turn it off once in a while.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Hear hear!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Damn right!
  - character: DWIGHT
    dialogue: So, should we turn it off now?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Well, uh, that depends what's on.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Nothing good.
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Ah let's just keep watching.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) TV party tonight!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Wha?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) TV party tonight!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: Oh!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (singing) We've got nothing better to do...
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (singing) ...Than watch TV and have a couple of brews!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (singing) Don't wanna talk about anything else...
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (singing) We don't wanna know!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (singing) We're dedicated, yes!
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: (singing) ...To our favourite shows!
  - character: CUBERT

  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Huh?  I choose to not understand these signs.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aha!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Bender?? I was just not playing the holophonor.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah well you should try not stinking at it.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I am trying. (ashamed) I've been taking lessons.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Lessons? Oh that's rich! Isn't it time you gave up all hope of ever
      improving yourself in any way?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I know I should but I just can't. Remember when I had those stomach
      worms that made me smart? I could play the holophonor and it made Leela like
      me.  Hey Bender, as long as you know, I have a holophonor recital Tuesday and
      I'd really like to have somebody there. Please?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fine I'll go already. Y'know sometimes I wish your real parents were
      still alive...not often.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Whoa...hey!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh...hello Mrs Mellenger.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I prefer the term "love machine."
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wow, your kid is great. How hard did you say you had to hit him?
  - character: MOTHER
    dialogue: Fairly hard.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: The...Grumpy Snail.  Sorry.
  - character: KID
    dialogue: (crying) It's too grumpy!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Ow! No! Quit it! Stop it!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Then good day madam!  We hope to see you soon for tea.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It's hopeless. I can hear all this great music in my head but my stupid
      hands can't keep up.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Aww, you know what always cheers me up? Laughing at other people's misfortunes.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Hey guys, you missed a great delivery to Space Earth. Where you been
      all afternoon?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh...a concert.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Ooo was it jazz-noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used
      to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein huh?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yeah, it's weird. Sean was uneducated, unambitious. He was pastey and
      hunched...
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (quietly) Pretty boy.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: '...But when he played I could sense this incredible, beautiful creative
      soul. Then one day I found someone else''s couch fibres on his butt.'
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: It could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch if I could
      just learn to play this stupid thing.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh but you can. Although you may have to metaphorically make a "deal
      with the devil." And by "devil" I mean "Robot Devil." And by "metaphorically"
      I mean "get your coat."
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No, this isn't a religious visit. Fry just wants holophonor lessons.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yep. I need to get really good without practicing.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Sure it would.  Oh well. Goodbye.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fry you smelly idiot, I think he's willing to make some kind of deal
      with the devil with you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: He is?  Great! Wait, what's the catch?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to -
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Fry if you don't take this offer right now I will lose all respect for
      you and punch you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Well...alright. You sure I probably won't know him?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Wow.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I got a hundred bucks on Rectal-Exambot!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's not ironic it's just coincidental. Now fork over those lady-fingers
      cookie!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Stop being such a baby and chop my hands off.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (impressed) How'd you do that?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: At last! At last I have the power to make Leela love me.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Check it out everyone. I'm back from hell and I've got the Robot Devil's
      hands!
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: Neat! Let's see a trick.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Alrighty!
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: Somebody called the Robot Devil's here to see somebody called Fry.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Uh-oh.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Where'd I go just now?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yeah, they get around! But I'm afraid we had a deal.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Yes you did.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: Only $14.99 for a two-record set. Two records! Oh Zoidberg, at last
      you're becoming a crafty consumer!  Hello? I'll take eight!
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: Mr Hedonismbot to see you.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Show him in.
  - character: SCRUFFY
    dialogue: Very good sir.
  - character: HEDONISMBOT
    dialogue: Ah Fry, congratulations. Your latest performance was as delectable as
      dipping my bottom over and over into a bath of the silkiest oils and creams!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Thank you sir, that's exactly what I was going for.
  - character: HEDONISMBOT
    dialogue: You were the sole diversion in what has been a pale and unamusing season.
      And so I would feign commission you write an opera.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But, I've never written an opera.
  - character: HEDONISMBOT
    dialogue: And I've never heard one. Still, if you can keep me amused through the
      overture I shall consider it a smashing success.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: But I wouldn't even know what to write about. Unless...  OK I'll do
      it. If I can make it about Leela.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Me? Really?
  - character: HEDONISMBOT
    dialogue: A man writing an opera about a woman? Oh sera, how deliciously absurd!  I
      shall see you at the premiere.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Is it part of the opera?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Leela!  You shouldn't be listening. I-I don't want you to hear it 'til
      it's done.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: But it's so beautiful.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: So's a peacock but you don't eat it 'til it's cooked. This has to be
      perfect. I want you to hear exactly what I hear when I think about you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Oh Fry. All this time you've had this incredible gift and I never knew.
      I've been a fool. A fully justified prudent fool.  They're so cold.
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (shouting) No!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: True but at least I don't have the hiccups anymore. What up?
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Forget it, you can't tempt me.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Hm. I forgot you could tempt me with things I want.  Well, I suppose
      I've always wondered what it would be like to be more annoying.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Grabby and Squeezy? Never! I love these guys!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: No, nothing ain't gonna happen.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yes! With this built-in stadium airhorn I can really annoy people. And
      all it cost me was my crotchplate.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Yeah, that'll teach the first person I see a lesson!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Well, Fry's opera premiere's tomorrow night. I'm off to find a pair
      of formal gloves that'll fit over my enormous forearms.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Pretty annoying, huh Leela?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) What? Are you talking? Oh God I'm deaf!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oops. I'm so so sorry Leela. I just wanted to annoy you.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (shouting) What? Oh this is horrible. I won't be able to hear Fry's
      opera.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: It's not ironic, it's just mean. Take this!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: Oh yeah? Well bite my shiny metal - (shouting) Oh nooo!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Nobody tell Fry I'm deaf. If he found out I couldn't hear his opera,
      it'd break his heart.
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: OK deafo.
  - character: HEDONISMBOT
    dialogue: Courtesans and gentle fops. I bid you welcome to my opera.  Let us cavort
      like the Greeks of old. (sexfully) You know the ones I mean.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Yay Fry!
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: I watch TV with that guy!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Amy, Fry's looking at me. What am s'posed to be feeling?  Ah!
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: I don't recall ever fighting Godzilla but that is so what I would have
      done.
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: One diet double Martini please.
  - character: BARTENDER
    dialogue: And for you sir?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: I'll just have a Shirley Hemple.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Half over? Oh, I'd give anything to hear the rest.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What? You can give me new ears? Wait, what seemingly reasonable thing
      do you want in return?
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Whatever you said, forget it!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Just...my left hand? Um...uh...
  - character: ANNOUNCER
    dialogue: Please take your seats for act two.
  - character: HEDONISMBOT
    dialogue: But I'm not done vomiting.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I can't stand it!  OK. You can have my hand.
  - character: CALCULON
    dialogue: Well I do owe you for giving me this unholy (dramatically) acting talent!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: I can hear! I can hear like a safecracker! Hey, aren't you gonna take
      my hand?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Look, what do you want?
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: Never! (singing)A deal's a deal, Even with a dirty dealer.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: Whoa!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (singing) Fry, you do not understand.
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: What?
  - character: HERMES
    dialogue: (singing) Is this really happening or just being staged?
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (singing) It can't be real -
  - character: AMY
    dialogue: (singing) Not if Leela is engaged!
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (singing) That isn't what I meant,
  - character: LEELA
    dialogue: (reading) I'll give you my hand...
  - character: BENDER
    dialogue: (singing) The use of words expressing something other than their literal
      intention,
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: (singing) Destiny has cheated me by forcing me to decide upon,
  - character: NIXON
    dialogue: Arooo!
  - character: ZAPP
    dialogue: Bray-vo! Enn-core!
  - character: FARNSWORTH
    dialogue: (singing) I can't believe the devil is so unforgiving.
  - character: ZOIDBERG
    dialogue: (singing) I can't believe everyone is just ad-libbing!
  - character: PREACHERBOT
    dialogue: (singing) By the power vested in me,
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: No!  Stop! Take my hands! (singing) You evil metal dork!
  - character: HEDONISMBOT
    dialogue: Surgery in an opera? How wonderfully decadent and just as I was beginning
      to lose interest.  The chocolate icing! Oh my!
  - character: FRY
    dialogue: My hands. My horrible human hands. And what did you do to my nails?
  - character: NIXON
