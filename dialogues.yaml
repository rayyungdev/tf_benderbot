ADLAI:
- Leave Leela alone. She's leading a perfectly normal life. She's not gussied up,
  duded out, getting down or where it's at. Now, run along.
- Nonsense. You're a space captain. That's a fine, conventional profession.
- Ah-ah. A package is just a box until it's delivered.
- Oh, I'm a doctor.
- I'm so sorry I teased you back then. Let me make it up to you. I can fix it so that
  no one ever makes fun of you again.
- No, I specialise in phaser eye surgery. I can build you a paraffin eye and graft
  it on with skin from your foot. It won't be able to see but you'll look like a perfectly
  normal two-eyed person.
- Now we'll find out if the operation was a success. Hold on to your hats. Oh, I'm
  sorry, this is the wrong patient. Oops.
- You'll get it. Personally, I try not to blink too much because it seems flashy.
  But when I do, I enjoy it.
- Hello, Leela. I was in a nearby tailor getting one of my Hawaiian shirts toned down,
  so I thought I'd drop in for your follow-up exam.
- Just follow the light with your eyes. Perfect! You know, a guy could fall head-over-heels
  for a gal like you. As for me, I'm somewhat interested myself.
- I've never been good with words, which is why I'm in such a delicate conundrum.
  Will you go out with me this Sunday?
- I don't know what else to say, so I'll just say it. Okey-dokey, see you then.
- I thought I'd take you someplace ordinary -- a place no one could object to.
- Average, please.
- Leela, you're 999,999 in a million!
- 'Uh, listen: I just want you all to know your Leela''s one standard lady.'
- You know, seeing that strange robot force 12 children to do his bidding makes me
  think about kids of our own.
- That's correct. It's time to stop living this vida bachelor loca, settle down and
  have kids.
- You know, doing this jigsaw puzzle of a pacifier factory makes me want to have children
  with you all the more.
- Adoption? Yes, that's acceptable. Heck, it's more than acceptable. It's adequately
  satisfactory!
- Uh, I'm afraid we only want one.
- Hmm.
- Her? But there's plenty of normal ones.
- On the other hand, the children bring up a good point. She does have an ear on her
  face.
- Oh, alright. If you really want that one, I can give her an operation to make her
  acceptable.
- Oh, and I suppose you were fine the way you were?
- Why should I do that?
AHAB:
- A gold doubloon to the man who first spies the white whale.
- I saw it first!
- The whale! He be white now!
AKI:
- Well Hiroki-san, when I asked him he asked what business it was of mine and conjectured
  that my mother was a prostitute.
ALBERT:
- Can we have Bender burgers again?
- Yeah.
- I gotta go poopy!
- Daddy Bender, I want a piggy back ride.
- Yeah, show us the picture!  There he is!
- I'm Albert.
- But it's 10 in the morning!
- We'll miss you, Daddy Bender.
- Marv Albert here at Madison Cube Garden where the Harlem Globerotters take on a
  squad of atomic supermen in what promises to be a by-the-numbers athletic contest
  with no surprises whatsoever.  Here's the tip-off. Globetrotter ball. Sweet Clyde
  Dixon to Bubblegum Tate. Drives down-court - and Curly Joe from the rear.
- Goose goes up... Rejected! Growtrium from half-court.  Yes!
- Supermen lead 45-42. Arachneon with the steal, to Thorias. Thorias from downtown!  Yes!
  He's really showing us what a man with a cannon in his chest can do!
- And that's the half, with the Supermen up 48-42. Surprisingly dull, so far. Bubblegum,
  the Trotters are down by six. Reactions?
- Curly Joe, easily amused by his own antics......continues to wreak havoc on -
- Ladies and gentlemen, something very strange has just happened in this basketball
  game between space clowns and atomic monsters.
- Globetrotters win, 244-86. A dark day for humanity, folks. We have been beaten...in
  basketball.
- Yes!
- Nuh uh, 'cause I'm double Leela!
ALBRIGHTBOT:
- Sure!
ALIEN:
- Word!
- Lets see, I'll have a pancreas, two sphincters and a large colon.
ALIENS:
- (in alien) Six.
ALKAZAR:
- Welcome home Leela.
- Ow! Of course I'm real!
- It's alright Leela. You'll never be alone again.  Let me introduce you to yourself.  Do
  you mind if your servants walk?
- We are the last remaining Cyclopses. Our planet is Cyclopia. This is our capital,
  Cyclops City. Stop me if I'm going too fast for you.
- This sacred mosaic depicts our goddess of beauty.
- Her perfect eye reminds me of yours Leela. Had our race survived, you would have
  been a temple priestess or a supermodel.
- And there's the pirate Purple Beard, scourge of the six seas.
- The Forbidden Valley. A holy sancturary where no one may tread.
- This is my home. I hope you don't think less of me because I live in a giant castle.
- In here's where I dream my lonely dreams and cook my simple meals.
- Its too painful to speak of now. Come, I'll show you your quarters.
- It's just - no Leela. I don't want to see tears in your perfect eye.
- Well OK. But it's chilly and you're going to be all wet from the tears. Let's go
  into my chamber.
- Things got hot. You look a little hot, you can take off that jacket.  Our people
  don't like to be hot. Anyway, just before the impact...
- Yes, but the real tragedy is that our race ends with us.
- What do you mean?
- I'm still not following you.
- Oh jeez what a night. Make me some coffee would you.
- Pancakes and sausage. Kitchen's in the basement, pans are in the attic.
- Yeah they'll come in handy if I need to cover any tiny manholes.  Listen hun, we
  don't want to look like slobs in front of the other species do we?
- So get to work on these dishes. And then organise my collection of naked celebrity
  photos by name and what you can see.
- Call me Al.
- You're right, I'm sorry. It looks like the relationshipisn't going to work afterall.
  So much for the Cyclops race. I thought it was a pretty good race but -
- Friends.
- They were giving it away on the street corner. Just like you Leela.
- By the way your pal Fry fell into the dungeon. Feed him a taco so he doesn't die
  and stink up the place.
- Jeez Leela, twice in one day? I'm not Superman!
- Yo Leela, what gives? Pig says your slop tastes like crap.
- Hey everyone jam a sock in your spit faucets.  Not long ago I spent my lonely nights
  renting slash flicks with Rat Man and his girlfriend. But then a beautiful woman
  arrived and - stop eating pig! And she brought new hope for me and our once great
  civilisation. Now a million centuries of Cyclops destiny depend on the answer to
  one question......Leela, will you marry me?
- Cut to the chase Preach!
- Yeah sure I do come on faster!
- What the?
- It, uh, oo!  Uh, hey sweetie, just go back to the castle and wait for me. She, she's
  nuts, I can morph into a 5-eyed alien and I kinda said I'd marry her. But I'm really
  a Cyclops and I'm really going to marry you.
- This is a bit awkward.
- Go back to the castle Sandy.
- Leela, this must all be ver confusing.
- Well, this is the real me. But I can explain. We all have needs. Mine was to make
  it with five weirdos and have them scrub my five castles. I gave you all what you
  wanted and of course I made a few bucks letting Pig watch through the two way mirror.
  Can any of you sa you wouldn't have done the exact same thing in my position?
- Hey lady, you got any idea how much it costs to rent a tux that changes shape?
- What's that?
ALL:
- (singing) What day is today? It's Nibbler's birthday, What a day for a birthday,
  Let's all have some cake.
- (singing) Where it's at!
- Happy birthday, Amy.
- (singing) The elves are back to work today!
- (singing) The elves have rescued Xmas Day! Hooray!
- Surprise!
- Nerd!
ALPHABOT:
- Hey hey hey.
- 80% likely.
AMAZONIAN:
- Big rats there. Me crush with club.
- Women only room!
- Him do good snu-snu.
AMAZONIANS:
- (chanting) Snu-snu, snu-snu, snu-snu!
AMY:
- OK. Does it hurt when I go like this?
- Hey! You're the unfrozen guy! From the 20th century, right?
- Look. We're not as rich as everybody says.
- (ashamed) Kappa Kappa Wong.
- Oh, I love stuff like the moon! Can I come, Leela?
- Guh! It's the happiest place orbiting Earth.
- Aye, aye, Captain! I mean only one eye. I mean, yes, sir, um, ma'am!
- Clear?
- Ready to hoist?
- Ow!
- Wow! I could swear I was really playing virtual skeeball!  Hm?
- The keys to the ship!  They must have fallen into the crate! Leela's gonna kill
  me!
- Mister? Could you please get those keys out for me?
- Shut up. You're distracting me.
- I know how to make love!
- Hey!
- Looks like both.
- Oh, this isn't right.
- Oh, my God, Bender, it's your thingy!
- (crying) Do you think Calculon's evil twin will ever walk again?
- You're too picky.
- You just have to give guys a chance. Sometimes you meet a guy and think he's a pig.
  But then later you realise he actually has a really good body.
- Let's all take her out tonight. There's lots of great places to meet people.
- Hmm, I'll pick!
- Oh, wow, it's totally retro.
- Guh! Because nobody wears them anymore! Rings are stupid!
- Shh! Don't let anyone hear you say that!
- Nope, he said they're stupid.
- So what do you think of that guy by the bar?
- Are you sure?
- This is Bolt Rolands. Bolt is a hyper-sled racer with 10 wins on the pro circuit.
- This is M-5438, an entity of pure energy.
- You're impossible.
- Buh!
- Yeah. I mean we all have commercials in our dreams but you don't see us running
  off to buy brand name merchandise at low, low prices.
- No thanks.
- Hey, Bender! Great new sweater.
- Hey! You're springing for Lightspeed? Pretty ritzy!
- Quiet. There's an ad coming on.
- Guh! It's Mom. The world's most huggable industrialist.
- Do we have enough money to pay Bender's fine?
- Cheers!
- That's true. On a TV like this I bet you couldn't even make out my obscene tattoo.
- I don't know, I've had cow.  Ew! Gross!
- Bender, is this salt water?
- I don't think you have anything to worry about. These people seem really mild-mannered.
- Hi!
- We've gotta get the Emperor out of your body before they kill you!
- What about crying?
- You did your best, Bender.
- C'mon. Leela's not the type to hold a grudge.
- Is she coming?
- Oh, no. They have her totally outnumbered.
- What are you talking about, Bender? She's al --  (muffled) Oh!
- We only got two drops.
- Great! We're one-tenth of the way there.
- OK, it's your turn.
- Good morning, Bender.
- What's his problem?
- Oh, yeah.
- Looks like we're on the Fiesta Deck.
- I think I'll go and fill up on bisque at the buffet.
- Oh yeah--!
- Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?
- Uh, he seems really nice but, well, I already have a boyfriend.
- Uh ...
- Mom, Dad. I'd like you to meet Fry, my boyfriend.
- Lean back more!
- Hey, Fry.
- Leela!
- Well, with Zapp gone and my parents still here, I suggest Fry give me a nice, convincing
  kiss.
- Yay, Hermes!
- Mom? Dad? You're alive!
- Uh, Mom, I don't--  Hi!
- Well, its not me!
- Yo, classmate. What you takin'?
- Boring.  Let's hear about Walter Mondale already!
- (impressed) Wow! Smart and cute!
- Dean Vernon, I'd like you to meet my parents, Leo and Inez.
- No, Nibbler!  (whispering) Psst, Professor, I need another bikini.
- There. How do I look?
- French?!
- 'Check this out: Back in 1999 the season finale of Single Female Lawyer was interrupted
  by technical problems. Apparently some zidiot spilled Coke on the transmitter.'
- There aren't any copies left.
- Plus, you don't really have the thighs for a miniskirt.
- OK ... all set!
- (cheering) Hooray!
- You should try homeopathic medicine, Bender. Take some zinc.
- Then take some Echinaea or a St. John's wort.
- Hey, that's my watch!
- Hey, yeah. Fry, Leela and Bender are missing.
- (simultaneously) For Slurms!
- Hey, look at Nibbler!
- Bender! How could you flush Nibbler down the toilet?
- It's like he doesn't understand simple humanoid emotion.
- Uh ... that's me.
- Bingo!
- Hey, you know what'd cheer you up? You should get a puppy.
- Um, Leela? Armando and I are going to the back seat of his car for coffee. You gonna
  be alright here by yourself?
- Are you crazy? There's mutants down there! They'll eat you alive.
- Only weirdos and mutants join third parties.
- So, is it true you can make all kinds of shirts and ropes out of hemp?
- I also heard hemp makes great shampoo.
- Yeah!
- You poor man. What happened to you?
- Oh, excuse me.  Hello there.
- Ow!
- Fluh! She's an orphan.
- I'll do it for you.
- Where are you going, Bender?
- You can't stay out on Xmas Eve. You'll be killed!
- If he catches you after dark, he'll chop off your head and stuff your neck full
  of toys from his sack of horrors.
- Hey, it's Leela.
- Oh, that's so sweet. But I sold my hair to a wigmaker so I could buy a set of combs
  for Hermes.
- Rudolph's nose!
- And, Bender, your beer belly's so big your door won't even close. And that doesn't
  even make sense.
- Hey, who's up for a nice hot steam?
- Psst, look what life was like before genetic engineering.
- (sexfully) Hey, handsome. Is there room in there for two?
- Fool me seven times, shame on you. Fool me eight or more times, shame on me.
- I'll do it.
- Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these while he's gone.
- Hey, let's go car shopping! My parents promised if I got all B's they'd buy me a
  bar. And I got all C's!
- That's an awful lot of eagle.
- What's wrong?
- Oh, don't be sad. My parents are paying and they're incredibly rich.
- Smeesh, Leela! This car has everything a beautiful woman like me needs. Victor said
  so.
- 60,000!
- I thought it was an auction.
- I'm sorry. 80,000?
- Uh-oh. I'm terrible at parallel parking.
- Hey, I'm taking my new car out for a spin to Mercury. Anybody wanna come?
- 'The usual: Boiling lead, oceans of lava.'
- (shouting) Hey, how about some icy margaritas?
- (shouting) Don't worry. I'll hit the fuel guzzler!
- It's OK, I have an emergency phone.
- Spluh! It's a video-phone.  Lucky I'm a member of the Astro-Afro-Antarctico-Amer-Asian
  Auto Association.  Hello? Septuple-A?
- It'll be a couple hours. Oh, I'm gonna get sweat on my sweat-suit.
- I guess 'cause my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike.  As though!
- Yeah, and if you were the Pope they'd be all, "Straighten your Pope hat," and, "Put
  on your good vestments". You know, Fry, its nice to find someone I can talk to about
  stuff, and junk.
- So while they're towin' us, you wanna do it?
- Yep.
- We ran out of fuel on Mercury and one thing led to another.
- I 'unno.
- Yeah! Hey, later, you wanna drive out to Europa? We could have a picnic and spit
  watermelon seeds at Jupiter.
- Yeah. Y'know, Fry, I really like hanging out with you.
- Hi.
- So, ready for a secluded picnic with just you and me?
- No. So, Fry, you busy tomorrow? I got two tickets to the big ape fight.
- OK, sure. What do you wanna do for Valentine's Day?
- But you just said--
- Huh? You don't like chocolate?
- Looks like we'll be spending a lot more time together, Fry!
- Fry!
- So, what was it you wanted to talk about before we crashed anyway?
- You're breaking up with me?
- But, I was really having fun.  If that's how you feel.
- Well, whatever. Hey, listen, as long as we're not seeing each other, you mind if
  I ask someone else out for Valentine's Day?
- I mean, unless it would make you feel bad, being a third wheel.
- With my body I think you might only attract one sort of woman.
- Oh, no problem.
- OK, Fry, we're done putting on the bra.
- What business is it of yours?
- This is deodorant.
- (shouting) C'mon in, Gary! I'll just be another 20 minutes.
- Yeah, but it's good to make them wait a little.
- (simultaneously) Thanks.
- Mm-mm.
- I don't really like coffee.
- Ooh, I feel a little tipsy!
- We were just on our way out.
- It's OK, I had fun. And if I ever feel lonely I can just look over at this disfiguring
  scar and think of you.
- That's Bender alright.
- And huge.
- Wow, when I was a little girl on Mars I dreamed of being Miss Universe.
- Aw come on Leela. Deep down all girls wanna be Miss Universe.
- Really? Maybe it's just cute girls.
- So how was the Spleef Nebula?
- (whispering) Just act normal and switch to a garlic shampoo.
- Guk! I hate subtitles. Alien films are so pretentious.
- Bender, you can't be an Ultimate Robot Fighter. It's the most brutal form of competition
  in the galaxy!
- Here, Professor, I got you a programme.
- Fry, where's your Brain Slug?
- Hey, that's me!
- Ew, that is so gross!
- Yeah.
- Congratulations Leela!
- Oh my God!
- I can't figure why she's so nice to you Fry.
- Yeah!
- Why?
- OK thanks.
- That's OK Hermes. At least we have you back.
- Yesh he would.
- Buh!
- You wish!
- What?
- Yeah!
- What was it like?
- Yeah.
- Oh, so this is where you shop for your boots?
- Sunburn! My fabulous body! It's ruined! What happened to my parasol?
- Well it didn't work!
- It's coming up!
- We're all gonna die!
- You think you saw a mermaid?
- Yes! Stop asking!
- Dude! An ancient sunken city!
- So, Fry, Atlanta was an American city in your time?
- Later.
- What about Umbriel?
- (whispering) Trouble in bed.
- (shouting) Leela, we're right here.
- (cheering) Alright!
- What's it made of?
- You doing alright over there Leela?
- Uh-huh.
- A bill?
- He's so polite.
- Leela, a little help is nothing to be embarrassed about. Like, maybe I could do
  your makeup.
- Ew!
- You sure picked it.
- Why?
- Leela, maybe you should lie down.
- That's her name, Philip.
- We're doomed!
- That's different.
- Can I have a fluke?
- Ow! What's going on around here?
- Really?
- What happens if the fire goes out?
- The professor can't walk all the way to the Bronx. How are we gonna get there without
  a hover-car?
- Wow!
- Way to go, Professor. The plan worked.
- Wow!
- Well, there goes the neighbourhood. There goes another neighbourhood.
- Wow! Sporty go-cart, Leela! So hip and sexy. Not like you at all.
- No.
- Right on, Professor!
- Oh no, someone you know must've died.
- Maybe he's right, look at these tracks.
- It's from the list of words you almost never say.
- Quit it!
- Oh, no!
- Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, I've been thinking. Do you think we could go out?
- Great!
- I'm from Mars.
- Gross!
- It's gorgeous. That place used to be a big dump.
- Worms? Eww! Puke-a-tronic!
- Right on!
- Leela, you should really try a facial scrubs, for your pores.
- I'm OK.
- Oh no!
- Those were toenail clippings.
- Hey, that's my cellphone!
- Hello?  Hello? Who is this?  Hello? Hello?
- Some guy's been calling and hanging up 10 times a day for a year.
- I just wish a decent guy would call me instead of this spleeze-ball who has me too
  terrified to even answer the phone.  Hello?
- Hello? Is anyone there?
- Call me.
- (whispering) Please, Leela? Kif's like the sweetest guy who's ever liked me.
- Kif, you're so quiet. You haven't said a word all night.
- '''Cause I was really hoping we could talk and stuff.'
- What?!
- Kif!
- Oh, that's so emotional!
- It's always a line with you!
- What is it?
- This women-only planet is sounding better and better.
- You all obey a big computer?
- Should we do something?
- Really? Honest and true?
- Oh, Kif!
- (disguised, deeper voice) Me next snu-snu. Out me way.
- Kif! Jump!
- It sure was.
- (crying) My javelin too! It's ruined. Now we'll never beat Jupiter State.
- Wait a minute. Bender? What did you just do to the Professor?
- Aha!
- What tapes?
- You remember your own birth?
- Let's get liquored up!
- I'll say.
- No, Bender! The other way.
- Is Nibbler stoked for the big pet show?
- Come on, Nibbler!
- No. Let's buy internet stock!
- Umm...
- So whatever happened to this seven leaf clover?
- I think cosmetic surgery's great, Leela. I used to be too cute, so I had cuteness-reduction
  surgery here......and here.
- Right on!
- Leela, those eyes look so great on you.
- Uh-uh.
- Oh, they're so cute! What are their names?
- Sploops!
- Duh!
- (unenthusiastic) Huzzah!
- Bender! You should be more ashamed of yourself than usual.
- Aw! He looks like a little insane drunken angel.
- Hooray!
- Wow, neat.
- Hey, the speedometer only goes up to 80. This thing can't go faster than 80,000
  miles an hour?
- Bender!
- Zoidberg, you idiot, my outfit. It's, it's -
- Me too, now that I'm used to it.
- Yeah!  One bowl of Jell-O knuckles, please.
- Oh no, my beautiful money.
- Bender, you're famous!
- You'd better not do that at the concert.
- You are so disgusting, I -
- I've never seen pearls like this. Dr. Zoidberg, you're amazing.
- Well, let's earn some bread.
- Hi!
- What's causing it? Is it my outfit?
- Professor, I hope you find out what's wrong before we skip right past my birth -
- Hooray, look at all these presents!
- Woo-hoo!
- Um, no.
- Hooray!
- Was it out in front of Discount Shoe Outlet?
- They have a college kid wear that to attract customers.
- Big deal.
- Ooo! That sounds cool.
- (disguised, deeper voice) We're also Santa Claus.
- No power.
- Bender, part of being human is having self control.
- No Bender.
- Yeah!
- Go away. We're not giving you our quarters no matter what.
- Greetings Leela, I'm The Cute With Of The North!
- Abracaduh! Just ask the Professor! He lives in the Emerald Laboratory down Martin
  Luther King Boulevard.
- The city council renamed it in 1975. (sarcastic) Ooo those are great shoes!
- Do they come in women's sizes?
- Cool!
- Romanticorp? Are they a corporation that makes romantic stuff?
- I do! Kif's given me dozens! Is it true what the ad says? That you kiss them together
  out of blanket cloth and magic buttons?
- Yee-ha!
- Your parents must be so proud. Oops! Sorry.
- Whoa, clool!
- Hey, Professor what's all this scloop, glorking out of the machine?
- Hi, Dad. It's me and my co-workers.
- Betsy!  This is my sweet, little Betsy. I raised her from a larva that ate one of
  my sweaters.
- Dad! Gleesh! Please don't say things like that when you meet my boyfriend tonight.
- RJ, this is my boyfriend, Kif.
- Just relax. I'm sure my parents will love you.
- Mom? Dad? You remember Kif?
- He's not scrawny, he's just small-boned.
- (whispering) Wrong way!
- 'Look on the bright side: My parents left after you passed out so they didn''t even
  see you barf.'
- It's OK, Kif.  I'll go get you a tissue from your tote.
- Don't worry, Daddy. It'll be OK.
- They're not your parents, I'm not your sister and that's not your golf cart.
- Everybody just calm down. Kif promised he'd catch the rustlers.
- No, Kif! It's too risky. You don't have to do this to prove your manliness.
- You're lookin' at her. Betsy's the only one left. She was curled up in my hamper
  when the storm hit.  Aw, she likes you!
- (from bushes) Surprise!
- I forgot to give you something before you left.
- Is that your camouflage reflex or are you just happy to see me?
- But you still have them, right?
- Ah, it's a wonderful night.
- I can't!  What's that?
- The buggalo! They're in the crater.
- Oh, Kif! You're so brave!
- Are you sure there's no other way to get the buggalo out?
- Well actually--
- Kif! You did it! But how did you know the dynamite would work?
- Uh-huh! Amy Wong.  And you are?
- Wait! I'm too rich to be kidnapped!
- I'm fine.
- Kif!  You're flying Betsy!
- Y'know, if you still want your land, we could just trade back for it.
- Then Kif flew Betsy, rescued me from the tornado and made peace with the Martians.
- Thanks for saving my life, Kif. You're my hero.
- Well globviously! But if they liked you then I wouldn't. Don't you know anything
  about girls?
- They don't leave much to the imagination.
- Bender was a truly special -
- (shouting) Bender was a truly special -
- I know who's funeral we'll be attending next!
- Fry, we brought someone to cheer you up.
- There he is!
- Second.
- Look, everyone wants to be like Germany but do we really have the pure strength
  of will?
- Oh no.
- Oh no.
- This stinks!
- I'm even richer!
- (shouting) Too much eyeliner!
- Don't be upset Leela. You, um...you look really cute in your uniform.
- (shouting) Come on Leela!
- Where does the other end come out?
- Professor Farnsworth, you're a scientist!
- Poor Bender.
- Ooo, it's a party. Apparently.
- Lassie is on display in the Louvre.
- Bender, are you jealous of Fry's puppy? That's so adorable!
- Yay!
- No!
- If you wanna do something, you do it! And to splick with the consequences!
- Woohoo!  Shman! The Great Rad Spot is mega sweet for mega party-boarding.
- Any calls while I was out?
- My Kiffie called?  Kif?
- Why didn't you just leave a message sweetie?
- You're going to Nigel 7? Kif's on patrol near there! You could drop me off on the
  way!
- I don't care how much trouble I get in. I needed to feel my lips pressed against
  your lipless beak!
- Here? But...uh...wouldn't it be crowded?
- Kif! You have so much creativity and niceness, but......I'm not sure if I -
- Well, that probably won't happen this time.
- This is so beautiful!  Spirit! Kif! That's the pony I always wanted but my parents
  said I had too many ponies already!
- Oh Kif!
- This isn't bad. My aunt had a place like this.
- Kif, I'd love to live with you...someday. But before then there's still lots I wanna
  do on my own.  What was that?
- Look! Spirit!
- Kif! Hold on!
- Hey yeah!  I mean...what about that Kif?
- Look Kif, I probably am the mother. Although maybe I'm not. Of course I hope I am
  but just in case I'm not, maybe we should have a test.
- 'That''s OK, at least Kif''s baby shower should be fun. I''d better put it on my
  calendar.  (to calendar) Thursday: Baby shower. Enter.  Might as well plan for my
  new life while I''m at it. (to calendar) Set Motherhood Mode.'
- Mom, Dad, I know this is weird but -
- Uh, they're already bronzed.
- Is it a party board?
- You, you trashed my party board?
- I still don't know if I'm ready for this but, I do know I love you. And I wanna
  be here beside you.
- You can do it Kif!
- Shoo! Stay away from my babies!
- And I'll be ready then.
- Are you off your rocket? Your parents are mutants. It's illegal for them to come
  above ground 'cause they're inferior genetic scum..uh present company excluded of
  course!
- Right on.
- Oh relax Professor. Youthasizing is a trendy new spa treatment, its this seasons
  shark cartilage enema.
- Professor it worked! You look young enough to be my father!
- You stink!
- Dad, if you're gonna make fat jokes until I get cute again I'm just gonna stay in
  my room.
- Let's go!
- Aw poo! We're even younger!
- What's that squirming under your shirt?
- Oh, me too!
- He looks so natural. It's funny to think he's clammed full of sawdust and preservatives.
- He's walking on sunshine now.
- I said everything's going to be alright.
- In every life we have some trouble.
- The doctor said you'd never wake up.
- Two weeks. Fry never left your side for a minute.
- No spluh! Why do you think I'm sitting over here in the stink-free zone?
- I'm not imaginary, I'm parallel! We're exactly the same, right down to the -  Splech!
  Is that pink nail polish?
- I am not evil!
- Is it a kind of hairspray?
- Splug! Which one did they go into?
- I'm slightly richer!
- Shmeesh! It's just 300 bucks, what is that, like a hundred cups of coffee?
- Oh Kif, it was so romantic of you to rent this peddle plane with your tax rebate.
  We're like two dandelion seeds wafting on the breeze.
- I almost feel kinda shallow for blowing my rebate on this cool talking tattoo!
- Shut up!  Ow!
- Oh Kiffie!
- You shut up! I love it Kif. I'll use it whenever I wanna know what time it is.  Ooo!
  It's Fry and Leela! (shouting) Hi Fry and Leela!
- Don't feel sad my little tadpole.
- Hey, it is kinda like that!
- C'mon Mushu! Barf! Barf like a freshman!
- Not precious ambergris?
- Oh Kif, it's so romantic I can't even wait! I'm gonna wear it right now!
- I do! Kiss me Kif!
- The sky out here is amazing. Look at all those satellites.
- Bender, wasn't that Fry's tent?
- Were they little grey dudes with big oval heads?  I don't get that gesture. Am I
  wrong?
- How 'bout those guys?
- Yeah, isn't that basically all Jamaicans do?
- If you have even the slightest respect for the dignity of women -
- Snuh-uh! You're making us look like jerks in front of the other genders.
- Yes.
- No way!
- No kidding. These gifts have been coming non-stop!  I think Calculon's falling for
  you.
- (whispering) Maybe she's right about the lipstick.
- What?
- Uh-huh.
- Aww!
- Spleesh! Mell out Bender. Come watch some TV.
- Help us wooden Bender!
- Look! My hair got singed into an even cuter do!
- Scary Door!
- Neat! Let's see a trick.
- One diet double Martini please.
- (singing) Not if Leela is engaged!
ANDERSON:
- Hurry up, please. I wanna get back to the head museum.
- OK, but I'm only doing this so people will take my head seriously as an actress.
- 'Hello, Fry. Remember me from Baywatch: The Movie?'
- It was the first movie to be shot entirely in slow motion.
- Crap!
- Oh, I'll have a cheese pizza and a large...uh...line?
- Oh, right! Cheese pizza and a large soda!
- So. What do I owe you?
ANDREW:
- Don't make me hurt you.
- You're outta the game!
ANDY:
- The short answer is I'm teaching.
ANGLEYNE:
- Making hangers. Guidance counsellor said I had a knack for it.
- What I always do. Jack squat.
- Well we are made of virtually identical components.
- Hey, according to the scab handbook that's extremely inappropriate banter. (sexfully)
  And that's just the way I like it.
- Well my legs are made of rubber.  And anyway, I am just as strong as you are, Mac.
- Bender, it's-it's not what you think.
- Now look, there is no reason to be upset. Flexo and I are divorced.
- Hey, Flexo.  So since when do you go to bars on work nights? It's not like you at
  all.
- Quit makin' with the googly eyes. You know that I'm in love with Bender.
- Well he may be a walking factory but believe me he is no wuss. Now look. You and
  me are through. I told you that when I divorced you.
- You know I love dancing but you always hated it.
- You used to be so inflexible, Flexo. You have really loosened up!
- Alright!
- Flexo? What-What's going on?
- Flexo!
- (laughing) You always were a kick in the teeth, man.
- Flexo, Flexo, Flexo. I'm starting to remember why I fell for you in the first place.
- Well, it's late. I should get home to my trailer.
- Well, goodnight. I-I had a great time.
- What?
- Hey look, I had fun but--
- But--
- (gasping) But...  Huh? Bender! You tricked me.
- Well maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you're pretending to be.
- (screaming) Nooo!
- Please stop! I'm not worth it!
- Flexo? Are you OK?
- You can't die. Tonight Bender showed me that I love you.
- I know and I care for you too. But I could never love anyone as much as you made
  me realise I love Flexo.
- What, what are you saying?
- You can't bend that girder. It's unbendable!
- I'll always remember this, Bender.

- So you lost the atom huh? You're garbage, human garbage! Do you braindead space
  jockeys have any idea how much that thing is worth?
- You're closest without going over.
- I'm not signing squat. You find me that damn tiara before the pageant ends.
- Enough out of you. I may be against the fur industry, but that won't stop me from
  skinning you alive! As long as no one wears the skin.
- Next up in what is generously called the "Talent Competition," performing a traditional
  gangster rap, Miss - what the?
- Huh? Oh yeah, that looks like him. Whatever.
- Take him away.
- Alright, let's put an end to this pathetic hoedown. Brannigan read the thing.

BARTENDER:

BARTENDERBOT:
- Two Fuzzy Navel's comin' up.
BECK:
- Hey, thanks. You a fan?
- Don't take it so hard. I used to miss my body too but then I fished this manequin
  out of the 92c Store dumpster.
- So do it, robot. It's easier than it looks.
- Or maybe you'll be the best musician ever.
- Try and scrape it across your chest like a knife on burnt toast.  Come on, move
  those arms. Use the power of mental thinking. Make it dynamic.  Yeah-ee! Alright,
  congratulations my friend.
- Exactly. I use those all the time in my music. Bender, I want you to become my new
  washboard player.
- (shouting) Come on, move it! We gotta get to the concert and make the audience wait
  for it at the start.
- (singing) There's a destination a little up the road
- That was a washboard break.
- Bender, that was the best 40-minute washboard solo I've ever heard. And the parts
  when I was awake blew my mind.
- Whoa, dog. Just cold chill.  You know, when I'm upset, I write a song about it.
  Like when I wrote Devil's Haircut, I was feeling really...what's that song about?
- '"Odelay" is a word. Just look it up in the Becktionary.'
- I wish I could help raise awareness about broken robots. But what can I do? I only
  weigh eight pounds.
- We can all get together for a big benefit concert in San Francisco!
- And you can sing that song you're writing!
- (shouting) Can't you hear those cavalry drums
- (shouting) ...Midnight hags in the mausoleum...
- Thank you. That song doesn't usually last three hours, but we got into a serious
  thing...and then I forgot how it ended. Anyway, one last item of business before
  we go.
- Then maybe you should sing it. Lay it down boys.
- Kick it!
- (singing) He only has to stand there
- (singing) He doesn't need to move
- (singing) That would be good for soup
- I like 'em tight!
- For real?
- Hm.
- Who's that?
- C'mon, give it up.
- (singing) It suffers alone
- Hey.
- Bender, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- What's the dealy-o?
- Hold it! What? No!
- B-Bender.
- No!
- Cut it!
- Cut it!
- Cut it!
- You, minion, lift up my arm.  After him!
- Good.
- Bender, that's some played-out, new-jack, horsecrap. But I know you don't mean it
  so, apology accepted.
BEELER:
- Mr. Fry? I'm Dr Ben Beeler, the paleontologist who discovered your dog, or as some
  call it, the Beeler-saurus.
- No we're sorry but there's just too much that fossil can teach us about dogs from
  your time.
- That's all I needed, Ray?
- OK then, here's your dog back.
- Interestingly, the Spiderians are more closely related to our elephants than our
  spiders.
BENDER:
- Lousy stinking rip-off!  Well I didn't have anything else planned for today. Let's
  go get drunk!
- I don't need to drink, I can quit anytime I want!  So they made you a delivery boy,
  huh? Man, that's as bad as my job.
- I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do.
- 'You kidding? I was a star! I could bend a girder to any angle: 30 degrees, 32 degrees,
  you name it! (unsure) 31. (normal) But I couldn''t go on living once I found out
  what the girders were for.'
- Suicide booths!  Well, Fry, it was a pleasure meeting you, I'm gonna go kill myself.
- You really want a robot for a friend?
- Well, OK. But I don't want people thinking we're robo-sexuals, so if anyone asks,
  you're my debugger.
- I'm not looking!
- We can hide in here, it's free on Tuesdays.
- Oh, we're trapped!
- Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes. What
  do I look like, a de-bender?
- I'll have to check my program...yep.
- You're full of crap, Fry!  You make a persuasive argument, Fry.
- Can't...I...can't...do...it!
- You were right, Fry! From now on I'm going to bend what I want, when I want, who
  I want! I'm unstoppable!
- (shouting) No, thanks.
- Looks like one of us will have to bend this grate.
- It's the decaying ruins of Old New York. Welcome home, pal!
- Keep 'em to yourself, pops.
- Wait! There's someone you know!
- No friends.
- I just wanted to be part of the moment.
- Sorry.  Well, that solves the mystery of the missing ring. This calls for a drink.
- You do now!
- Can we have some money?
- Well, we're boned!
- Two.
- New crew? W-What happened to the old crew?
- Yeah, like you don't have crap in your neck!
- A little.
- Hey, rich girl. Look over here! It's me, Bender. I'm being entertaining. (singing)
  La la la look at my head. It's all painted look at my head! I got a big old head,
  hey! Ho! (talking) Alright, show's over, I'm tired.
- Nice catch, idiot!
- Too much work. Lets burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
- Better mascots than you have tried.
- Idiots who need gifts for other idiots.
- Get it off! Get it off! Get it -- uh oh!  (singing) How many roads must a man walk
  down, before you... (talking) Keep those things off of me! Magnets screw up my inhibition
  unit!
- Yes. I guess a robot would have to be crazy to wanna be a folk singer.
- Oh, jeez, I went to high school with that guy!
- Yeah! You're the kind of guy who visits Jerusalem and doesn't want to see the Sexeteria!
- (shouting) Next year in Jerusalem!
- Look, it's that crate we were gonna throw in the sewer.
- Nah. She'll probably make me do it.
- Hey, look what I won from a tourist's pocket!
- 'Come on, it''s just like making love. Y''know: Left, down, rotate 62 degrees, engage
  rotor.'
- Here, let me do it.  Ah, lousy arm. Must be rigged!  That's her, officers! Uh, that's
  the woman who programmed me for evil!
- Yeah, well, I'm gonna go build my own theme park, with blackjack and hookers. In
  fact, forget the park!
- He'll never find me in here.
- Of course not. A lady that fine you gotta romance first.
- What do you mean "we", mammal?
- Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack
  and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack. Ah, screw the whole
  thing.
- Not the magnet! No! No! Nooo --  Uh-oh!
- (singing) She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes,
- (singing) She'll be riding six white horses when she comes,
- Well I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,
- Hey!
- That's right, we want some money -- wait, what's this about Fry?
- Fry, we've got to discuss your living arrangements.
- Hey, All My Circuits! Move over.  Ahh!
- Yeah, would you kindly shut your noise hole?
- That's a human.
- Eh, the usual human stuff. He laughs, he learns, he loves.
- Cheer up, meatbag, you've barely touched your amoeba.
- Nah, I'm trying to watch my input. I need plenty of wholesome, nutritious alcohol.  The
  chemical energy keeps my fuel cells charged.
- They make me look cool.
- Yeah, but everybody's a jerk. You, me, this jerk.  That's my philosophy. So, where
  you gonna stay?
- Yeah, but the rents are outrageous. Why don't you just come move in with me?
- Nah, I've always wanted a pet.
- Here we are. Your new home.
- Come on in, I'll give you the tour!
- Let's see, where to start. OK, this is the TV area, that over there's the breakfast
  nook, and over here is where you'll be living which is great because, until now,
  it's just been wasted space.
- Look, pal, you've only got one set of clothes and you're not taking them off while
  I'm here. Well, I'm bushed. G'night.
- (sleep-talking) Kill all humans...kill all humans...must kill all the humans.
- I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.
- Bath what?
- What room?
- What what?
- (sleep-talking) Hey, sexy mama...wanna kill all the humans?
- Yeah, this past week with Fry's been a blast! Y'know, beneath this warm, sunny exterior,
  beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot.
- Hey, there's my little space heater.
- What?!
- Not enough room? My place is two cubic metres and we only take up 1.5 cubic metres.
  We've got room for a whole nother two-thirds of a person.
- I don't know. I've got a lot of great memories in my old place.  And now they're
  gone.
- What the?
- What's with all the crap?
- Whoa, slow down! This place just doesn't feel like home. It just isn't...cosy. Ahh,
  I can barely move.   It's perfect!
- Yeah! It's gonna be fun on the bun! Y'know Fry, of all the friends I've had, you're
  the first.
- Wow, heavy drinking crowd!  I'd better go out for more beer.
- I know, but I need alcohol to power up my batteries. If Calculon's wedding doesn't
  go just right I'll be emotionally and electrically drained.
- Hey what happened to the TV?
- This is an outrage! I'm gonna go yell at the manager!
- What? That's the last straw!
- Yeah! And you'd better get rid of whatever's causing it or we're outta this dump!
- You people are nuts. My antenna never interfered with my old TV.
- Madam, I believe you're mistaken!
- Wow, that lady's got a huge ass!
- Those could be anyone's thoughts, fat ass!
- Fine! Come on, Fry, let's move to that apartment that smelled like a sewer. You
  liked that one, right?
- Or we could live underground with the mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's boss!
- I don't understand.
- But, then we wouldn't be roommates.
- (downbeat) Happy. Yeah, that's Bender. Always happy.
- It's so big and empty.
- My roommate's gone. And all he left behind was an eyelash and three skin flakes.  Oh,
  what's the point?!
- Leave me alone!
- Hey. What I don't do is none of your business.
- I hate the people who love me and they hate me.
- Like how? Having my antenna removed?
- Are you crazy? That's Little Bender you're talking about. I can't cut it off. You're
  not a robot or a man so you wouldn't understand. I gotta get out of here.
- I promise nothing!
- That's right! I'm sober and crazy and I don't know what I might do!
- I don't know what it is yet. Oh, yeah, now I remember. I thought I could live alone,
  but I can't. So, I'm gonna do what it takes to be your roommate again.
- No, I'm going to chop off my antenna.
- I'm gonna do it! I'm really gonna do it! Don't try and stop me! Here goes.
- You're my best friend, Fry, I'm sorry I treated you so badly.
- Nothing. I guess I'm just going to have to get used to being half a robot.
- Maybe. If we get it on ice right away.
- This time, you'll have all the human comfort. We'll get a couple of toilets, some
  food cookers, maybe a puppy.
- It sure is. By the way, I saved your stuff.
- There's a window in the closet.
- In a closet? Oh, humans!
- That sounds like a cry for help.
- A saucy puppet show.
- Forget it, he's gay.
- I just know these things. I've got what they call gaydar.
- No?  OK, I got a lock on him.  Yep! He's gay!
- Definitely. Unless I'm getting interference from a gay weather balloon.
- (whispering) I think she means 10 wins on the gay circuit.
- Just as well; I think he comes from a dimension that's big on musical theatre.
- Can do!
- So, Leela, you must have had your pick of the litter last night at closing time.
- Why two?  Oh!
- That'll take forever. What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two eyes, then
  poke one out.
- Here you go.  You can use this as an eye-poker.
- A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we can always build more Killbots!
- Well just in case you guys hit it off you'll wanna take this with you.
- He's throwing us in prison.
- You really are too picky.
- Hey, yeah!
- Nah, I'm comfy.
- So should we get our stuff and head down to the planet?
- So you're saying we can cook him?
- Aww! (whispering to Fry) I'll fire up the grill!
- I found a pair of Hermaphlamingoes.
- Hey. What the?
- He's pending for a bending.
- Yeah, I'll do it when we get back.
- So what's your problem? It's not like you slept with him.  Oh, my God!
- Can do!
- What the hell was that?
- So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel?
- So a couple of animals didn't die and Leela got lucky. That's what I call a successful
  mission!
- Hey, nice seats! We're close enough to when you knock a player down with a beer
  bottle, he stays down.
- I got me a souvenir!  Aww, here you go, kid!
- Hey, buddies, who wants popcorn?
- Anyone want butter on that?
- Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues!
  Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there was a blern hitting machine!
- Oh, and I suppose Pitchomat 5000 was just a modified howitzer?
- You humans are so scared of a little robot competition you won't even let us on
  the field.
- Yeah, doing crap work! They're bat boys, ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But
  how many robot managers are there?
- Zero!  And what a surprise! Look who's scraping up the filth. Is it a human child?
  I wish!
- 'Admit it: You all think robots are just machines built by humans to make their
  lives easier.'
- I've never made anyone's life easier and you know it!
- Oh, so just 'cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a "radical"?
- Oh, I get it, make the robot do all the work!
- Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.
- Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.
- It wasn't just a blast. It was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which
  happened to take the form of a drinking contest.
- Alright, I'll go. But so help me, I'll hold a grudge against every last stinking
  one of you for the rest of your lives.
- No. It's inhabited by robots!
- Yes, Miss Leela. Tote that space barge, lift that space pale.
- (ironic) I'll try to keep that in mind!
- I'm in trouble. They found out I work with humans and -- oh, no! Oh, no!
- Death to humans!
- Many said I was too extreme when I first called for the annihilation of the human
  species, as well as some of the more cunning monkeys. But after living on Earth
  I can tell you that I am, if anything, too merciful!
- Thank you! Thank you! And if you enjoyed that diatribe then you'll want to purchase
  my spoken word album, just 18.95! Act now and you'll get this Bender action figurine.
- Now, your basic human is between three- and 25-feet tall and is made of a hairy,
  oily goo wrapped in a t-shirt.
- Sure, why not?
- Nothing. Today's active humans prefer a low-calorie bait.
- Wait! What's that?
- Hmm, sounds like a breeding ground for humans. I'd better check it out.
- Oh, yeah! You're a bad girl, aren't you?
- Huh? Wha? You! What the hell are you doing here?
- I was. But they let me go when I told them I killed a million billion humans.
- What for?
- I don't wanna be rescued.
- I love this planet. I've got wealth, fame and access to the depths of sleaze that
  those things bring.
- Friends? That activates my hilarity unit! I'm just a machine to you. You're no more
  friends with me than you are with the toaster or the phonograph or the electric
  chair.
- Well that's how it feels to me.
- Go on, get out of here before you get caught.
- Uh...got you...you murderous flesh piles!
- Alright, let's make this quick, I'm due at the opening of a mini-mall. Hey! What
  is this?
- Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would it be alright if I just gave 'em a savage
  beating?
- Aww!  I can't kill them. Plenty of humans have mistreated robots but not these two.
  They're my friends. Humans are no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid cowards.
- The fact is, humans are completely harmless.
- You are?
- Well, I'm glad we got all that out in the open. We'll just let ourselves out.
- Hey, hold on a second, I forgot to deliver the package.
- Wow, I can't believe you guys did all this for me! This is the best Robanukah ever!
- Aww, thanks! You do know that I made Robanukah up to get out of work, right?
- In that case, let the dancing begin! Hey, you guys are good. How the hell do you
  do that?
- Quit squawking, flesh wad, nobody's forcing you to buy anything.
- No thanks I --
- New? What sweater? I came in with it. I don't know you people!
- Mmm, tasty!
- I'm boned.
- Uh, there's obviously been some sort of a mistake here.  I'm sure there's......I
  say I'm sure there's......that is, I'm sure there's...a very...reasonable...
- Maybe you don't understand just how rich he is. In fact, I think I'd better put
  on a monocle.
- Maybe you're forgetting just how rich you are.  Huh? Huh?
- Hey! Get a load of this pathetic 20th century TV!
- Well, aside from causing eye cancer, these things had a lousy low-definition picture.
- Ah, leave him alone, Leela. So he's going a little wacko with his money. It's OK.
- Yeah, it is cute.
- Yeah. Now are you gonna come to the squid fights with us or sit here wallowing in
  your prehistoric junk?
- We thought you only cared about cans of anchovies and stuffy old songs about the
  buttocks.
- Wheee!
- Who did?
- (singing) Going through the 'bot wash!
- (singing) Goin' through the robot wash!
- Ah!  Aww!
- Uh, nothing!
- No, of course not! It was...uh...porno! Yeah that's it!
- (ashamed) Oh, it's true! I've been hiding it for so long.
- You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!
- Hmm.
- Yeah! We're gonna kick it up a notch. Bam!
- Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if I was wearing a lime green tank top.
- Yep. Every chef knows that this is the place to get exotic gourmet ingredients.
- Hey, buddy. I'm looking for fresh slug.
- Whatever.
- Yeah, yeah, either one's fine.
- (shouting) Thank you!
- Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that.
- Here it comes.
- Thank you, and goodnight.
- Almost ready!
- Now for a dash of salt!  Uh-oh!
- It's salt with water in it if that's what you mean.
- There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less than a lethal
  dose.
- You know, Fry, I've often thought about becoming a Prime Minister.
- Yes! In your face, Gorgak!
- Stay the course, pal!
- Hey, look. The suns are setting. I can finally switch to hard liquor!
- Check out the glowing freaks. It's beautiful! Hey, what's that?
- Shut up, you!
- Hey, why don't you just sweat him out?
- I'll make you cry, buddy!  You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount
  to anything.
- 'Good point. But here''s a disturbing reminder: Everyone you knew or loved in the
  20th century is dead.'
- OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no God and your idiotic human
  ideals are laughable!
- Man, I guess it's harder than I thought to make someone cry.
- Up yours, bimbo!
- Cram it, lobster!  That is a good idea. I'll go call her.
- I'm not giving my name to a machine.
- Fry's in trouble...
- '...and he needs help. Now, I don''t like you and you don''t like me.'
- You do? Look are you going to help or not?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What is it you like best about me?
- I'm not sure. But I do know that she likes my in-your-face attitude.
- Wait a second. Here comes Leela.
- You do? Hmm.
- I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out this window. Oh, dear God in heaven, they're
  swarming all over her.
- They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, they're putting some ice cubes in the glass
  under it.
- It can and, for all you know, it is. I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead.
- I told Fry you were dead so he would cry out the Emperor but you had to go and wreck
  it by surviving.
- Hey! Save some for me!
- Sounds boring.
- Ooh! Dibs on his CD player!
- I've been perusing your fortified wine list and I've selected the '71 Hobo's Delight,
  the '57 Chateau Par-tay and the '66 Thunder Chevitz.
- And mix them all together in a big jug.
- (shouting) More wine!
- Yep!
- Ooh, ooh, name it after me!
- Well, lets get looting!
- Yeah! And this beer can is made outta old robots.
- Oh, crap!
- (ironic) Oh, boo-hoo!
- "OK  (\xE0 la Homer Simpson) Mmm! Shorts!"
- There's your problem. The Professor put the counter on upside-down.
- Right!
- It's gonna blow!
- OK, OK, keep your space pants on. I'll take care of this.
- Can I get anybody a beer?
- I believe that qualifies as ill. At least from a technical standpoint.
- Hey, Fender! Man, I haven't seen you since high school. You still workin' at Jack
  In The Box?
- Count me in! I'm gonna drink til I reboot!
- Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.
- Uh hey, I'm no square but isn't that counter-indicated by my operations manual?
- Well, if jacking on'll make strangers think I'm cool, I'll do it!
- Eh, no need to worry. I don't have an addictive personality.
- Shut up, square!  I'll just be a minute!
- Hey! Do I preach to you when you're lying stoned in the gutter? No! So beat it!
- Yo mama! Now shut up and drag me to work!
- None of your business, get off my back!
- No! Don't come in!
- Alright, let's get to work! I'll be out in a second.
- None of your business! Get off my back!
- A what kind of disturbance?
- Come on universe you big, mostly empty wuss! Gimmie all the juice you got! Oh, mama!
- What?
- You're right. I'm a lost cause.
- Maybe there's another way.
- Oh, yeah, that's the good stuff.  (crying) What am I doing? What have I become?
  Huh?
- (weakly) Me.
- (singing) Oh, what a beautiful morning, oh what a beautiful day! (talking) Greetings,
  friends. Don't we all look nice today?
- No, I'm whacked out on life. My friends, I found religion.
- Wonderful. Then you'll all come to my exceedingly long, un-air-conditioned baptism
  ceremony!
- Yes, I do.
- Uh, while you're at it, could you touch up this seam?
- The old Bender's gone. He won't trouble you anymore.
- No poison for us, thanks. I'll stick with good old mineral oil.  Ah! Functional!
- 'Friends! Friends! Surely you''re not going to eat before we say Robot Grace? In
  the name of all that is good and logical we give thanks for the chemical energy
  we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerimatic: 1000101010101...'
- '...0010110012. Amen.'
- Yes.  But first, since I love you all so much, I'd like to give everyone hugs. Come
  here, Fry!
- Mmm! Mmm! Fry, you're my friend!  C'mon, everyone line up for a hug. Let's tear
  down some emotional walls.
- Sanctifying it!  There! That ought to convert a few tailgaters.
- I can't believe somebody hired an interstellar spaceship to deliver a package to
  Atlantic City. What are we delivering anyway?
- Where are we delivering it to?
- Another job well done. Now back to the office for an enjoyable evening of fasting
  and repentance.
- But, those girls don't wear cases. You can see their bare circuits.
- What?" Drinking wine is a sin. Even if it is deliciously fortified.
- Thou shalt not snatch.
- Stop tempting me! For once in my life I have inner peace.
- Well...
- I'm the greatest.  Woo-hoo!
- You know it, pork pie! Except for one thing.
- Y'know, as a major Hollywood director I'll be holding auditions tonight for my next
  movie. And even though you're all young and naive, I think you might just have what
  it takes.  Hey! I'm trying to score here! Can't you read the "Do Not Disturb" sign?  No!
  No!
- I'm hallucinating this, right?
- But I don't belong here. I don't like things that are scary and painful.
- Aww, hell - I mean heck!
- Aw crap, singing. Mind if I smoke?
- (singing) Just tell me why.
- (singing) There must be robots worse than I.
- (singing) Then please let me explain,
- (singing) Ah, don't blame me blame my upbringing!
- No! Oh they're tormenting me with up-tempo singing and dancing.
- Well, we're boned.
- I could if you'd drop the stupid gold violin!
- Don't worry, guys, I'll never be too good or too evil again. From now on, I'll just
  be me.
- I don't know. Do you think you could survive a 700ft fall?
- Me neither. (upbeat) Food was good, though.
- Shove it! We quit!
- Alright!
- Aww, you!
- Was that before or after you slept with him?
- Come on, where is it?  Ohh!
- Well, I'm tired of this room and everyone in it. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna
  pop over to the casino for the next 135 hours!
- Hmm.  I'm bettin' it all!  Come on, baby needs a new pair of feet!
- No! My cheating unit malfunctioned! You gotta give me a do-over!
- Gimmie you're biggest, strongest, cheapest drink.
- Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bender.
- I assure you, I barely know the meaning of the word "labour".
- Please, call me Bender.
- I was just about to suggest the same thing.  Pay dirt!
- Yeah. But only 93% as lovely as you.
- 'I don''t get it, iZac: That bracelet had a diamond the size of a racoon''s brain.
  Why couldn''t I steal it?'
- Oh, it's true. But we're star-crossed robots. She, a countess built with a silver
  spoon in her mouth. And me, just a regular honest Joe.
- Hell, no!
- Fellas, please. I'm in love!
- Well, now you know. I'm not actually rich. I'm a fraud. A poor, lazy, sexy fraud.
  This isn't even a real bow-tie -- it's magnetic.
- You do? Really?
- You all go without me. I'm gonna take one last look around. You know, for, uh, stuff
  to steal.
- (whispering) Alright, I am. But I don't want the others to know. If I don't come
  back, just say I died robbing some old man.
- I love you, buddy!
- (shouting) Countess? Countess?
- (shouting) Are you hurt, my sweet?
- Just hang on! I'll take care of that fire!
- And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third time. But that would be it.  When we kiss,
  I feel like I'm standing waist deep in a pool of cold, rising water.
- Wait a second. Aren't you a member of the yacht club?
- (shouting) Wait for us!
- I can't live without you. If you let go, I let go!
- Don't talk like that. Tragic romances always have a happy ending.
- Nooo!
- She's gone.
- At least I'll always have her bracelet! What do you think it's worth?
- Another job well done.
- Hey look. There's a chapter of my old robot fraternity; Epsilon Rho Rho.
- Of course, I'm a bender. I went to Bending College. I majored in Bending.
- Robo-American Studies.
- Uh, no, actually I'm an Epsilon from way back.
- Thanks. Here's your finger back.
- All the coolest robots are in this fraternity.
- Uh-oh, nerds!
- You're all losers. My name's Bender.
- (modest) Yeah, well, a lot of 'em were children. Anyway I should get going.
- Hmm, OK. But I'll need 10 kegs of beer, a continuous tape of Louie Louie and a regulation
  two-storey panty-raid ladder.
- Bingo!
- Oh, yeah! Someone's been a bad computer! Get a load of that!
- Cheese it!
- Hey, dean, nice looking model.
- Now, I can explain that.
- No fair!
- Cheese it!
- Well, looks like the party's winding down. Let's take a road trip to Tijuana and
  get Fatbot some action.
- Oh, yeah? Watch this!
- Hey!
- (shouting) Not as sure as I was an hour ago!
- (shouting) Come on, everyone! Big party in Robot House!
- Ow!
- Aw, yeah!
- Truly a great man. Look at him up there.
- OK, now you go hide.  Nice knowin' you.
- OK, everyone, come and get it!
- Bite my red-hot glowing ass.  Wait a minute. Red-hot glowing ass?  (calmly) I'll
  be right back!  Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!  Aw, yeah!
- Alright, alright, I'll bust you out. Cheese it!
- Right here, buddy.  Wait, I wanna be in the picture too.  Pretend you're happy.
- Hey, look, Leela, it's that idiotic windbag you slept with.
- Evidently not.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. I refuse to fight. I'm a conscientious objector.
- You know, a coward.
- It is every robot's duty to give his life for the good of humanity.  Oh, crap!
- Well actually I--  Sir, yes sir! Sir!
- Sir, I volunteer for a suicide mission. Aw, cut it out!
- The auxiliary power's out, and they spilled my cocktail.
- (sadly) Yeah, but it'll never bring back my martini.  (normal) Well, who wants a
  martini?
- Well if they're hoping to see a TV show that hasn't existed for a thousand years,
  pfft, they are royally boned.
- They must just wanna see that episode. Let's find a tape and give it to 'em.
- (dramatically) And I, I could be an acting coach!
- (singing) ...And being self-reliant.
- We'll be back after this word from Crazy Bender's Discount Stereo.
- "(\xE0 la Arnold Jackson) Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Fry?"
- (singing) Single Female Lawyer, Having lot's of sex-- (talking) Huh?
- You did it, Fry!
- Look at that worm go. Who says there are no more heroes?
- I'm sick.
- My tummy hurts and I've been having this burning electrical discharge.
- I'm 40% zinc.
- I was wondering where I put that.  Hey, now I feel much better! Thanks, Professor.
  And, Amy, I'm sorry I took your watch.
- What should we point it at first?
- Wow, neat! Mind if I try that again?
- Whoa, mama! Hold still, sexy lady.
- That's no lady!
- Hey, bite my shiny metal ass!
- Huh, w-what? I didn't hear you. I was too busy using this F-ray to look inside of
  things.
- Ah, this thing stinks.
- You did it, Fry! You found the winning bottle-cap! We won!
- Hey!
- Wow! The original party worm!  Are you ready to get down, get funky with us?
- Look! Flowers! And a boat!
- (whispering) Psst, those berries. Those are the secret ingredient, right?
- You positive?
- I'm just asking cause they look kind of secret.
- OK, OK, we get the point.
- (shouting) Shut the hell up!
- Everybody was doing it. I just wanted to be popular.
- Ow!
- And why is the Slurm pouring into this sewer?
- Oh, Lordy!
- I'll save us!  Oh, that feels good!
- Uh, your majesty, I brought the prisoners.
- Look, we just came to party with Slurms MacKenzie. By the way, when is that scheduled?
- Ah, this trip is turning into a big letdown.
- I can't see what's happening. Are we boned?
- What's happening?  Just in time!
- Slurms MacKenzie?
- Forget it pal.  It says on this bottle-cap you have to party with us.
- No can do, Slurms!
- Party on, Slurms!
- Yeah, that Slurms sure loved to party. Whattya say we all party one last time for
  him?
- (simultaneously) For Slurms!
- Hey, that's not that bad.
- (shouting) Ow, my head! My precious head!  (talking) Stupid can opener. You killed
  my father and now you've come back for me!
- Yeah, I guess so. But I don't see why we keep this ticking time-bomb around just
  for that dumb animal.
- No.
- I'll pet him. I'll pet him with both hands!  Ow! My ass! Get off!
- Ah, it's nothing a lawsuit won't cure.
- Hey, I got a busted ass here, I don't see anyone kissing it.
- What's that you say there, doctor? You're gonna have to put him down?
- Terrible shame that. Shall I do the honours?
- You about done?
- (sarcastic) I'd be cuddly too if someone gave me a new cape.
- Ooh, me! Everyone watch how good I am. And the crowd goes wild! What prize do I
  get? Cash?
- You call that talent? Gather round old Bender and get ready for the show of a lifetime.  Ta-da!
- Hey, what about this?
- Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler.
- So it's a cake you want, is it? I'll make you a cake you'll never forget.
- That'll take care of those annoying rats.  Now, to bake a cake so delicious they'll
  have no choice but to love and worship me.
- There! This'll teach those filthy bastards who's lovable. Now all I have to do is
  spell check it and it's ready for my admiring public.  No! Get away from there!  That's
  it.
- Happy birthday!
- Hey! Can't you see I'm using the toilet?
- Well, step one, I had to lift the seat. That was the first little annoyance. Am
  I right, men?
- Only one way to find out.
- Of course I do. Right now I feel sorry for you.
- Yeah. I mean, one cantaloupe-sized bloodshot eye? You ain't winning no beauty pageants,
  lady.
- Bet you weren't expecting that one, Calculon!
- Hey, what the hell are you doing with my head?
- Why don't you just use a potted plant like Fry?
- Ooh! Ow! Son of a-- Careful with that! Ow ...
- '... Ow! Professor!'
- Ow!
- My God, I'm overcome with ... feelings. I'm experiencing a powerful yearning to
  ... to cram my gullet full of mackerel heads.
- Now I'm worried that I'm not as smart as Leela, but at the same time I feel relieved
  that I'm cuter than her.
- This time I miss Nibbler and I'm feeling nosy and opinionated.
- Happy. I like this feeling. Just don't revert to your usual mopey self.
- Anger, huh? How dare you make me feel anger, you one-eyed jerk with a dead pet!
- (crying) I miss Nibbler.
- Hell, no! It's Leela's stupid feelings. Why can't she just drink herself happy like
  a normal person?
- Uh-oh, jealousy.  (shouting) You think you're so hot!
- The only reason you get all the guys is because you dress like a tramp!
- (crying) I'm so lonely. I'm gonna go eat a bucket of ice cream.  (crying) A bucket
  of ...
- I'm at the end of my rope. I can't live another minute without poor, sweet Nibbler.
- Really?
- Hmm, sewers.  Thinking, thinking, thinking.
- Hang on, Nibbler. Uncle Bender's coming to save you.  Damn, it's too small. What
  did those human design this for anyway?  Aha! Bender, one; toilet, zero! See you
  on the other side!
- I never should have thrown out the manual.
- I know. But I just missed Nibbler so much.
- (crying) He was so sweet.
- (shouting) Nibbler?
- (simultaneously) Idiot.
- You guys realise you live in a sewer, right?
- Eh.
- Nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand.
- (shouting) Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums.
- Then what are those?
- Hey, yeah!
- Oh, I made myself feel bad.
- Nibbler! Aw, come here precious!  Look everyone, it's El Chupanibre.
- Say what?
- I'm too scared.
- 'Listen to me, Leela: I''m an expert at not caring. The secret is to stop giving
  a rat''s ass about anyone else and start thinking of the things that you want, that
  you deserve, that the world owes you.'
- Bigger! Bigger!
- Don't stop now, you'll need some pants to go with that outfit.
- Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler.
- No thanks.
- I love you too.  Get that stupid chip out of me before I kill myself!
- And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, losers!
- Hmm. Get him, boys!
- Nope. Watching cartoons.
- (whispering) He means you guys did it.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Fry already wiped off some of the dirt with his finger.
- I'm Bender. You know? The lovable rascal.
- And mean.
- Hey, this guy's alright!
- They're not very heavy but you don't hear me not complaining.
- Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all the pillows at once.
- Uh-oh.
- Some breaking occured, the dolly was involved, that's about all we know.
- I'll start loading up the pillows.
- (mocking) I'm Leela, get to work, neh neh neh.
- This is all Leela's fault.
- Beer?
- You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the new captain.
- You got it, genius.
- Don't worry, Leela, soon we'll be able to look back on this and laugh.
- To the ends of the universe.
- Yes, sir, sir!
- Nailed you, buddy!
- Yes sir, sirdy-sir-sir-sir!
- What now, chief?
- Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess ... and my banjo.  And Fry.
- As your God is my witness.
- Oh, man, that crap's heavy.
- Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I wouldn't worry about it.
- Quick.
- Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can we have a week off?
- Come on, Captain.
- Cursed by his own hubris!
- Hey, that's what Fry said when we turned on the debate!
- Ah, yes. John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a cord with the voters when he pledged
  not to go on a killing spree.
- I'm not allowed to vote.
- No, convicted felon.
- What? Lord have mercy!
- Alright! I'm rich!
- My body's 40% titanium!  I'm finally richer than those snooty ATM machines.
- (ironic) Oh, can't I?
- Watch me, poor man.
- Game's over, losers. I have all the money! Compare your lives to mine and then kill
  yourselves!  Hey, get away. Shoo! I'll give you five dollars to not do what you're
  thinking about doing. You just lost five dollars!
- Hey, buddy. Little help?  (shouting) Thank you!
- Hello, peasants.
- No, I sold my body.
- Pft. Bodies are for hookers and fat people! All I need is a wad of cash with a head
  wrapped around it.
- Yeah, right. What's he gonna do, break my legs?
- Ah, this is the life. Another martini, please.
- Shaken, not stirred.  Aw, yeah!
- Put it all on black.
- Yes! The rich get richer!
- Strike! In your face, Leela!  Ow!
- (shouting) Timber!
- Maybe if you clean up first. It looks like your neck stepped in something. Oh, I'm
  sorry, that's just your body!
- 'I''ve had it up to here with this place. I''m off to the Head Museum to hang out
  with classy heads like me who appreciate the finer things: poetry, philosophy, hats.
  So long, coffin stuffers.  Uh, could one of you coffin stuffers please carry me?'
- Now, which group of heads is good enough for me to hang out with? What do you think,
  Fry? Fry?
- Ah, US presidents.  Sturdy shelves, good security.  This place has class.
- So then the hookerbot says, "That's not my expansion slot" and my friends says,
  "That's not my gold-plated 25-pin connector!"
- You know, I like it here. What's the rent on one of these jars?
- Pass.
- I hocked it.
- Same reason you hocked your teeth.
- So, Nixon. Even if you miss your body, being a head's great too, right?
- Oh, great. Now you tell me!
- (sleep-talking) Ones...zeros...one, one, zero, zero, one --
- Whoa, what an awful dream. Ones and zeros everywhere. And I thought I saw a two.
- I know what this is about. My body loved me, and I turned its back on it. Well,
  old friend, tie a yellow ribbon round your neck, 'cause I'm a-comin' home!
- You sold my body? To who?!
- (crying) Oh! How could I let this happen? I can't go through the rest of my life
  like this.
- (crying) Yeah, but it's on my body. What am I gonna do?
- Oh!
- That dirty, double-crossing bastard! How dare he run off with Richard Nixon!
- Yeah you are, you stole my body! Fry, Leela, you gotta help me!
- Great. First he steals my body, now he's touching my stuff.
- Give me my body back you two-bit thief!
- That was a good one!
- (crying) It's hopeless. We might as well turn in my head for the five cent deposit.
- Whoa, mama! Get a room, you two!
- Well then lose some weight.
- (whispering) Psst! There I am!
- I'm just here for what's mine. Don't make me kick your neck.
- Not so fast, Nixon! Are you familiar with audio tape?
- Ah, it's good to be back in one piece again. Except I can't get these damn bumper
  stickers off.
- Get out of town!
- Well it ain't my fault. I'm a non-voting felon, thank you.
- No. they fixed that 900 years ago.
- I doubt it!
- Eh.
- 'Ah, lets face it: Comedy''s a dead art form. Now tragedy ...  ... That''s funny!'
- Enough of your mindless chitchat, let's get going.
- Lookin' good, meatball!
- Lick my frozen metal ass.  Uh-oh!
- Ah! Nothing like a warm fire and a Super Soaker of fine cognac.
- Yes! I got the most! I win Xmas!
- Hmm.  Ah, a picture of my mommy.
- (upbeat) Hey, buddy, heard you needed cheering up! Well old Bender'll make you laugh.  Look
  at me look!  Oh, man, I gotta work on my act!
- Xmas Eve; Another day where I accomplish nothing.
- To volunteer at a liquor kitchen for homeless robots.
- I'm very generous. What about that time I gave blood?
- Some guy's.
- Yeah, yeah, amen. Listen, I'm one of those lazy homeless bums I've been hearing
  about. Could you point me to the free booze.  Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah! You filthy hobos sure kow how to live.  Hey, chief, someone's stealing
  your handkerchief full of crap.
- My God! That poor kid!
- Whoa, hold on! How about inviting us in for a traditional glass of hard cider?
- (from inside) Get her purse!
- (singing) On the 4th day of Xmas I stole from that lady.
- (singing) And a slipper on a shoe tree.
- No, wait, I know these guys. They got nothing.
- What? Me? I didn't do nothing. You're thinking of the kid.
- (shouting; from outside) Help!
- Use teamwork!
- Yeah? Well I don't believe in Santa Claus. Come on, everybody, if you don't believe
  in him he can't hurt you.  Ow! God! The pain!
- Xmas dinner, everyone.
- I found it lying in the street, like all the food I cook. Dig in, everyone.
- You got the toenail!  Oh!
- Aw, jeez. Let's just pray I have the energy to get myself another beer. Oh, what
  is this? The Middle Ages?
- Hey, looks like Zoidberg's finally coming out of his shell.  Get it?  He's coming
  out--
- It's always so sad when a friend goes crazy and you have to have a big clam-bake
  and cook him! Yee-haw!
- Moron!
- I'll get the water boiling!
- (from inside) Moron!
- You're looking less nuts, crabby.
- Look! Outdoor theatre! Let's get tickets. Oh, let's do!
- Like whale barf.
- Please, he's no different from the rest of you organisms; Shooting DNA at each other
  make babies. I find it offensive.
- '''Cause he''s a loser, that''s why. He''s the lobster equivalent of Fry.'
- So I returned his artificial heart and ever since then I've been known by the name
  of Honest Bender.
- Oy.
- Fate is cruel and unyielding and what must be must be. (shouting) Takin' all bets!
  I'm giving 9-2 on Zoidberg, the crab with the jab! The Great Red Hope, come on baby!
- Fry, I've never asked you for anything before but if it's not too much trouble,
  when it comes to the ninth round just let him win.
- Oh, so this is suddenly all about you. Sheesh!
- Ow!
- Psst, Fry. Take a dive.
- Oh, my God!
- Shoo! Get away! Hey! What's with the flying jerks?
- Yeah!
- Mind if I tag along? I gotta bring my ass in for servicing.  The recall notice says
  it could burst into flames in a low-speed collision.
- You, sir, have defaced a national treasure! I demand you restore my buttocks to
  their former glory.
- What?
- Congratulations, Fry, you snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she's probably
  got other characteristics.
- Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg here is desperately poor and miserably
  lonely? Puh-lease!
- Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think I have a scheme
  so deviously clever that I--
- Stupid anti-pimping laws.  Well, pay the man!
- Shut up, baby, I know it!
- Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside
  your head".
- Hey! Don't make me go upside your head!
- OK, Mister...?
- Just check off the things you're looking for in a love partner.
- Now to run it through our high speed romance-a-logical data-fier.  Say hello to
  Miss Right!
- Are you familiar with my friend Al Gore? I'm tellin' ya, losers get really desperate
  around Valentine's Day.
- 500 bucks.
- Zapp Brannigan OK?
- '600.'
- I got your hook-up, Fry. Now my usual fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's you,
  I'll need it in advance.
- Fry, look who I found! It's Petunia, your dream girl!
- She is well-travelled. And I don't mean she travels a lot!
- Now how about a rose for the lady? Five bucks a pop!
- Eight bucks.
- Demand suddenly skyrocketed, you all saw it.
- Leela, meets your future husband Sal.
- Ooh, sparks! (whispering) Buy her a rose, I guarantee she'll put out!
- Of course not.
- Yep, everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender.
- Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?
- True. But in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?
- My ass! My beautiful ass!
- Nah, this week I'm on Caught On Tape 3 because of what I did in the coffee pot.
- (tense and impatient) Shut up and get to the point!
- C'mon Fry, I really wanna see it. You know how I yearn for a simpler time. A time
  of barn dances and buggy rides, before life was cheapened by heartless hi-tech machines.
- Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah...
- Learning is fun.
- I gotta say I'm really enjoying the day out with you people - Hey, a suicide booth!
  So long suckers.
- (disappointed) Oh.
- Ohh, it's a turnstile.
- C'mon Fry get up!
- Wow. Now this guy had taste!
- We've come a long way baby!
- There's a baby in there huh?
- I think I got whiplash.
- I meant ass whiplash.
- Hey brobot, what's you serial number?
- No way! Mine's 2716057!
- We're both expressable as the sum of two cubes.
- Shut up and hoot.  Hubba-hubba, she is built! In Mexico I believe.
- Pervert.
- How much more?
- Halt. Who goes there?
- Fry who?
- My God Fry just 'cause the guy's got a beard you label him as evil? Well I got a
  label for you pal. An ugly little word called "prejudice."
- Ah save it for the cross burning Adolf!
- You know it!
- Alright.
- Aye aye captain. It appears that Flexo has outwitted us all. Especially me...Bender.
- I locked down the ship but he may have already gotten away.
- Roger that, I got a map of the ship right here.
- Well, he wasn't in the uh, kitchen room.
- Any leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt? I think not.
- Alright, take it. Sheesh.
- It's a darn shame.
- Of course, who said I wasn't?
- It's a little thing called "style." Look it up sometime.
- 200,001?
- Got you!
- Shoot him, he's choking me!
- Aw jeez.
- Yeah but I can explain, it's very valuable.
- Eh, they're both fine choices, whatever floats your boat.
- Me too.
- My man!
- 'Who invited you? Let''s just see All My Circuits: The Movie.'
- Good point, Bender.
- Hey, gimmie a large diet malt liquor and a popcorn with extra motor oil.
- (shouting) Go Masked Unit!  Uh, hey, buddy! Yo!  You mind taking your head off?
- Just ask Flabby over here to describe it to you later.
- Well they should have stopped making her about halfway through.
- (mocking) "Pardon me, sir. But you seem to be bleh bleh..."
- Sure thing, pal.
- (fake shocked) Who threw that?!
- Oh, I'm boned.
- You should see me at funerals.
- Ultimate Robot Fighting? Sounds pleasant! I'll do it.
- I'm gonna be the greatest Ultimate Robot Fighter ever. Float like a floatbot, sting
  like an automatic stinging machine!
- It is?
- Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
- Crippling pain? That's not covered by my insurance fraud! Count me out.
- Leela's right! I don't wanna end up a loser like her. Count me back in!
- Still ... can't ... reach!
- Let's commence preparations for rumbling!
- You can't hit what you can't see!
- Huh?
- Y'know, I think I he might be dead. I took a life!
- Hey, he's not dead. What's up with that?
- You mean I'm not a great fighter? I just won 'cause I'm popular?
- Woo-hoo! I'm popular!
- Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
- I'm just an ex-con trying to go straight and get my kids back.
- You know, I'm also an Ultimate Robot Lover.
- What do you mean, "we"?
- Hey, Bender the Offender doesn't need you. Bender the Offender doesn't need anybody!
- Well obviously I need floozies! Let's roll!
- Howdy, chief. For my next bout, what do you say I fight these two bimbos in some
  mud?
- What if I told your we wouldn't be fighting in the conventional sense?
- Those morons! I said pea berry, not sandalwood!
- But the crowd loves me.
- Oh, yeah?  Well what if I don't let the new guy win?
- (squeaky) See you at the fight.
- So then I said, "See you at the fight". And that's the story.
- It's one thing to win a fixed fight -- there's dignity in that. But to lose? And
  in this atrocity? I can't do it! Leela, you gotta train me to win.
- I'm a real toughie!
- (determined) I'll put on my tutu!
- Got it. Large kickle, hold the tickle!
- Sorry, buddy. Here you go!
- I was born ready! Gimmie the bell! Did you hear a noise?  Final boarding call for
  flight 406, non-stop service to pain.  Now boarding standby passengers--
- (weakly) Fry! Throw in the towel!  For God's sakes, Fry!
- (weakly) Mommy!
- Why won't anyone help me?
- Huh? It's bendering time!  Take this. And this!
- I think you misunderstood the concept of "bendering time"!
- Yes!  Oh!
- I'm in tremendous pain here.
- Yes! I'm the greatest! The greatest!
- Behold! The internet!
- No it isn't. I just took some pictures of your face and stuck them on someone else's
  body.
- I'm telling you Fry they've got a chatroom for everybody. And here it is.
- So how 'bout them Knicks?
- Too bad it's a dump.
- Ooo! I'm gonna need to make some room!
- Ow!  Ow!  Ow!
- 'Ah, Leela''s experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel: Worshipping some lowlife
  jerk.'
- Uh no thanks I'm good.
- I don't know Fry. For the first time in my life I feel like I've stolen enough.
- Sorry I don't know what came over me. Let's go.  (singing) I love stealing, I love
  taking things!
- Whoa Mittens!
- Each more identical than the last!
- And here's another one with no eyes.
- I don't know. I only gamble with chumps.
- I'm in.
- C'mon, let's deal. You'll have plenty of time to talk when you're poor.
- They're my lucky shades. I stole them off some lucky guy while his lucky seeing
  eye dog was taking a whiz.
- Uh, what can I say? Must be my lucky shades!  Nothing, nothing, crap, crap, garbage.  Read
  'em and leak saltwater!
- If I were you I'd be more worried about that tapeworm going to town on your intestines.
- Um...uh...
- Guys, I swear those are prescription. I need them for reading stuff - on the other
  side of stuff.
- Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!
- Martini drinking contests with the autopilot. I would've had him this time but we
  ran out of olives.
- Morgan made me walk the Professor. There we were in the park when suddenly some
  old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked the Professor at her but she kept on
  coming. So had to hit her with this purse I found. Ah, the point is it's Morgan's
  fault. That pencil pushing scazwag.  Why if she were here I'd - Uh oh is she behind
  me?
- Hey Fry, I made you a candle with - What the?  Oh now I see! Now I get it. Now the
  pieces are falling into place. The office, the promotion, that dwarf in my book
  club who steals my opinions.  It's all coming together now!
- I must say this opens my eyes! Another case closed my dear Watson.
- For I was blind but now I see!
- Oh you didn't understand? Well let me explain. You......were having sex with you.
- That's what makes it so juicy. Its the forbidden fruit angle everybody loves. First
  I'll say "You'll never guess who saw Fry and Morgan doing it!" and they'll say "Who
  Bender, who?" and I'll say "It was lovable......old Bender."
- I'm Bender baby, please insert liquor!
- 'Good evening I''m -  Whoa, sorry. I''m Bender and I''ll be MC-ing this roast. Y''know,
  they say you can judge a man by the company he keeps, so here''s the Professor''s
  oldest friend: A grotesque, stinking lobster!'
- Where would the Professor be without students who love and respect him? Right there!  But
  seriously, of all the former crew members of the Professor's delivery ship, our
  next speaker is by far the most alive. Captain Muskie?
- And now, a man who needs no introduction. (whispering) Fry, get up there!
- How 'bout a few words Professor?
- I said "words."
- Funny funny stuff.
- (spookily) Nobody knows!
- I hope he didn't die. Unless he left a note naming me his successor. Then I hope
  he did die.
- Is he dumb or just ugly?
- Uh...me no speaka the English.
- Im pending para un bending!
- Aye chihuahua!
- Oh my God, oh my God! It's Elzar, the TV chef! Oh kill me now people!
- Oh Elzar, everything's so good!
- Yes sir, good one sir!
- Oh yes Elzar.
- (unmoved) Well, life goes on. Except for you!
- You bastard!
- Lay it on us big boots.
- To the flying machine!
- No we're not you little bed wetter. Oops I'm sorry.
- I think I know where to get some.
- Got a hot steaming batch right here!
- Eh, keep the change buddy.
- And yet he looks so natural.
- (shouting) Your social security cheque is late! Stuff costs more than it used to.
  Young people use curse words!
- That's a complete load.
- So we're in international waters?
- Falcon, this is Blue Raven, the goose has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested.
  Hey, guess what you're accessories to?
- Leela's right, fishing blows. Whattya say we make it interesting?
- Everybody kick in five bucks.  There, wasn't that interesting?
- Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this big!
- Harpoon, my ass!
- Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided fishing rod.
- Fine. I'll head over to the other side. (shouting) Good luck fishing on this side!
- Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!
- Couple more of those and you'll have yourself a fish stick!
- Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this! If I'm not gonna catch a fish, I might as
  well not catch a big fish.  There. Like most of life's problems this one can be
  solved with bending.
- Then why do I have to be careful?
- I don't know. It wasn't here when I took your umbrella.  What? I put sunblock on
  you.
- Hey, I'm snagged.
- What's that? Is someone bending girders?
- People, it's far far worse than we thought; My fish got away.
- (restrained) Tempers are wearing thin. Let's just hope some robot doesn't kill everybody.
- Aw, yeah!
- Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty grub.  Arr! The laws o' science be a harsh
  mistress!
- Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs.
- You want some lemonade? You saw a big parade?
- Yeah, right!
- I didn't kill him. Professor?
- I got it covered.  In the event of an emergency, my ass can be used as a floatation
  device.
- (awestruck) Bend me!
- Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still alive! (whispering) I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids?
- (crying) Oh, Fry!  I'll miss you!
- So that's where I left my cigar.
- Hey, buddy!
- Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy.
- Wow! I'm finally gonna see my favourite chef, TV's Elzar. Oh this is the greatest
  nanosecond of my life. No, this one is - no, this one. Wait...that one was slightly
  worse. Ah, so far so good on this one.
- Yeah!  Alright! Yeah baby!
- Elzar, you're my god. Please sign this sketch I drew of you.
- (disappointed) Oh.  (normal) Alright, yeah!  (quietly) Alright, yeah!
- (loudly) Boiled? Interesting.
- No, you shut up.
- Oh yeah, bam it again Elzar. Knock it up another notch!
- Come on you wimp. Work that weasel. Quit holding out on us.
- I gotta get this notch-up knocking on film.  Hey Elzar, think fast.
- Bam!
- It's Elzar again! Oh my God I'm so excited I wish I could wet my pants.
- (cheering) Hooray for blindy!
- Oh Fry, you gotta try this sterno-nicoise!
- It's so good. Oh just try a little!
- God, yes Elzar.
- Hey wait a second. I've got the perfect solution.
- I love cooking and Elzar's ass likes getting kissed right?
- So, how 'bout I work part time at the restaurant to pay off our debt?
- Hot diggety!
- That'll be easy. I never wear the damn thing.
- Well, I'm off to work at the restaurant. One of you will have to fill in for me
  while I'm gone.
- Well, if that new give can't handle thing, gimmie a call.
- I'm done siphoning out the grease trap. I think I need a mint.  So uh, what job
  do I move up to? Pastry chef? Saucier? Soup guy?
- (muttering) Bam yourself!  (talking) Hey, who are they?
- Are they the robot mafia?
- Uh, let me bus that for you gentlemen. No, what I meant to do was...
- Mind your own business and get out!
- No you gave me a fifty.
- Yeah you did.
- I'm tryin' but he's not makin' it easy.
- Wow thanks.
- You gave me a twenty.
- Are you kidding? I've always wanted to break into gooning!  (shouting) Hey Elzar,
  I quit.
- Wow, you guys run numbers?!
- That's just what my mom used to tell me.
- That's some fine oil-ade son. We could use a man like you in the Robot Mafia which
  I'm sorta in.
- Aw crap, the cops.
- What seems to be the problem officers? Was I speeding?
- Uh, I'd rather plan some fellonies.
- Joey, Clamps, Donny B!
- A little of this huh?
- How 'bout "Blotto"? It's witty, it's got street cred. Plus I can keep my monogrammed
  slippers.
- It's funny. Until now I always wanted to be a gangster...so the answer's yes.
- An alibi huh?
- You know the secret of traditional robot cooking? Start with a good high-quality
  oil...then eat it. So whats this big score anyway?
- Zubans? Those are the finest cigars in the universe. I can stink up a hole maternity
  ward with one of those things.
- And all without killing anyone.  This gang's got some fresh new ideas. I admire
  that.
- Um, uh, um.  (fake hurt) Ooh ow! He got me! Ow, what a shot that guy is.
- Sorry I'm tardy old bean, I was just enjoying a rather tasty watercress sandwich.
- Capital idea old sport.  I say, get the hell off me!
- My word, what have we -  Uh, nothing to see here old girl.
- Uh wait, old...spice. Let me have a go at this mechanised chap. I can be quite the
  rough customer.
- (fake voice) ...Take that you twit. (normal voice) No! Stop it!
- Uh, hey Donny, baby, gimmie a chance here huh? Yous guys skidaddle. Let me take
  care of the doity woik.
- Phew.
- Uh, help! Help!
- Yes I am. Having just this minute regained consciousness.
- Yeah it broke alright
- So they sent a helpless child to kill me? Well I'm not going out without a fight.
- Oh sweet legal tender!  Kid, tell the Donbot I'm quitting organised crime. From
  now on I'll stick to regular kind.
- And maybe someday I won't listen.
- Nah, those lousy Moochers cleaned out our pantry. All they left was baking soda
  and capers. And here it is!
- 'Problem solved: You two fight to the death and I''ll cook the loser. (whispering
  to Leela) Work his gut; I like it tender.'
- Ah, don't get your hopes up. We're a billion miles from nowhere.
- I found some rocks. You guys eat rocks, right?
- "(tempting) Not even if they're saut\xE9ed in a little mud?"
- What are you, blind? It looks more like a hole full of fried prawns.
- You know what these would go great with? Rocks.
- The planet's covered with 'em.
- No, a whole Bender-ful!
- They're tasty, right? Let's call 'em "Tasty-cles".
- Why not?
- Good idea.
- Whoa, whoa, slow down there, Sigmund. I can't stand idly by while poor people get
  free food. We gotta sell these things!
- Bender's a genius.
- Ah, great is OK, but amazing would be great.
- Hey, Mac, where do you want those rat droppings you ordered?
- Eat it or beat it.
- Hey, Fishy. I've been meaning to write you about your in-store kiddie parks. The
  slides won't support an adult robot.
- Yes! I'm gonna be rich.  You too but it's hard to get excited about that.
- (shouting) Or what?
- (shouting) OK, we won't eat you.
- My booze!
- Popplers can't talk. Leela must be hallucinating from not eating enough Popplers.
  Here, eat some now.
- I said "eat"! Come on, mange!
- Yeah. Maybe it just learned to talk as a parlour trick. Like Fry.
- Hear me, hear me! Stop eating Popplers! Stop eating them with honey mustard sauce......stop
  eating them with tangy sweet and sour sauce. Stop eating the new fiesta Poppler
  salad. Stop taking advantage of the money-saving 12-pack. Stop enjoying Popplers
  on the patio, in the car, or on the boat. Wherever good times are had!  Ow!
- Philip?
- Doooo...!
- I'll miss you, Leela.  I know you're just a carbon-based life form but I'll always
  think of you as a big pile of titanium.
- (crying) Just like titanium!
- (whispering to Fry) Someone's acting awfully aluminum.
- Bingo!
- I can't look!
- Let's get drunk!
- Here you go.
- Who wants dolphin?
- Not this one. He blew all his money on instant lottery tickets.
- Come look, everyone. I just got the dearest presents for Mommy.
- I didn't steal 'em, I bought 'em.  I love her that much.
- Oh, precious things. I found the most adorable little figurine of mice having tea.  And
  a framed picture of me when I was only a month old.  But, the best part is, I found
  my exact feelings expressed in a greeting card.
- I'll get a couple of chumps to help me.
- Come on, you call yourselves chumps?
- (sly) Uh, wasn't me!
- Upsy-daisy.
- Hey, look, the Robot Museum! You guys wanna learn about robot heritage?
- Well, if you insist. But you're paying!
- Ooh, ooh, wax replicas of the most famous robots Mom ever built!
- That's the world's greatest robot artist, Vincent van Gobot. He was built without
  an ear, but then he went crazy and had one installed.
- Hey, let me try.  Whoa, that gives me a headache!
- Who is he, I'll kill him!
- It's me! No one else look in this mirror!
- I'm her favourite.
- Any jerk can tell her! Bender has a little more up his sleeve.
- Mom! It's me, Bender. Look at me! I want attention. Hey ho!
- That's my mama!
- Hello, losers.
- No way, pork pouch. I'm rebelling with my brother devices. Isn't that right, Comrade
  Greeting Card?
- From now on, you guys'll do all the work while I sit on the couch and do nothing.
- Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?
- Yes! In your face Gandhi!
- Alright, greeting card, I'll grab the cash, you wreck up the place. And - huh?
- Sorry, Ma, but you ordered me to rebel. And loot I shall! Ooh! A six-pack of strawberry
  champagne. Don't mind if I help myself!
- Say what?
- No liquor? Do svidaniya, comrade!
- OK, fan. Just hold still and let me just - whoa!
- Well, time for this robot to get back to work.
- 'Ooh! Ooh!  I wanna aks it a question! As a robot living among humans, I''ve never
  really felt accepted at parties or nude beaches. So I''ve always secretly wondered:
  What if I was 500-feet tall?'
- My work here is done!
- I'm a big robot and I want a big cereal!
- Put it there, pal!  I meant your wallet.
- Oh, yeah! That calms the shakes.  Hey! (laughing) Aw, quit it1 Come on!
- Hey! I called this city. Quit touching my stuff!
- Bite my colossal metal ass!
- (shouting) Who wants lobster bisque?
- Huh?
- Who put this in here?
- 'I''ll tell you ... with my final breath. I came here with a simple dream: A dream
  of killing all humans. And this is how it must end? Who''s the real 7-billion-ton
  robot monster here? Not I.  Not I.'
- Go, man! Go!
- Whatya got? Disposal trouble?
- Sure is shocking about the Professor, huh?.  And now Hermes is mysteriously missing.
  Anyhow, it doesn't affect me, Bender. Hey, what's this? Hermes' dreadlocks? And
  his arm? Leela, I'm shocked. Food goes in the disposal, hair and flesh go in the
  trash!
- Not even a little. There's nothing wrong with murder, just so long as you let Bender
  wet his beak.
- '"Blackmail" is such an ugly word. I prefer "extortion". The "X" makes it sound
  cool.  Please, honey, I''m made of metal. Like you''re really gonna hurt me with
  a-- Hey! What are you doing with that microwave?'
- Hey, look! An ugly scared guy! Boo!
- Hey, there he is again. And he brought nerds! Take this!
- (singing) B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender!  B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender! Sayin' B-E-N-D-ERRR...
- I hope it was one of my enemies, those guys suck!  Oh no, my uncle Vladimir.
- Tomorrow, at the family castle. Followed by the reading of his will.  Well, I'm
  rich. Goodbye, losers, whom I've always hated!  C'mon, it'll be fun!
- Uh, pardon me, my good simpleton, could you take us to yon castle?
- Yes! Let's stay there tonight.
- Oh man, there's always a catch.
- 'Ah! I got a good vibe from this place: Nice long dinner table, quiet, well-behaved
  spiders, graveyard-adjacent. Yep! It''s gonna be -'
- That painting, the eyes are watching me!
- So does my butt, but I don't frame it and put it on the wall! Although... What's
  that?
- No doubt about it, this place is haunted.
- The last human ghost. But robot ghosts?
- It's just gibberish.  (reading) 1010011010?!
- Uncle Vladimir!
- That's what they said about being alive.
- (screaming) No!
- Somebody tried to run me over. And not with a normal hover-car. It crept along the
  ground on round, rubber feet, like a wolf!
- Ah, I just need sleep. I had nightmares all night about cars running people over.
- Robot porno theatre? I was in that...general area, last night. Whoever ran me down
  on those moors must've followed me back here.
- 'Yeah?! Could a big, hallucinating baby do this: (crying) I scared!'
- Where...? What the...?  Transmission fluid? Where have I been? What happened?
- Please, I'm scared.
- I passed out around midnight, which is much earlier that usual, and when I woke
  up, I found these in my chest cabinet.
- No, I think I may have hurt someone. Oh Lord, I'm on the verge of a nervous meltdown.
- You're right, I need professional help. And damn the expense.
- Damn the expense!
- Phew!
- A were-car?
- I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough to get away with it. Can't
  you help me?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I'm with you.
- Otherwise, I can never die?
- No! I wanna live! There's still too many things I don't own!
- Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?
- Oh God. Fry, I'm so glad to see you. I didn't hurt you did I?
- I tried to run you over?
- Fry, it doesn't mean anything. I have love enough for two.
- Whatever.
- (sarcastic) I wish I was stupid and violent. Then we'd see what's what, I'd pound
  him till -
- We're whaling on the original were-car, which is you, you jerk.
- "S\xED."
- Let's kick him some more.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're a thousand years old? Your bio says you're 27!
- Give us a name MacButt!
- (whispering) Psst, there it is.
- Look, everyone love killing people, but I don't wanna hurt my friends.
- Hey, this is starting to feel pretty good!
- Oh boy, I feel like a car in a candy store!
- Uh-oh.
- (crying) I must've killed him. He's my best friend and I killed him. I never felt
  so empty inside.
- Hey, that's my last beer, you bastard. I'll kill you!
- And it pinkens your teeth while you chew.
- What?! This is the worst kind of discrimination. The kind against me!
- OK, now I'm mad.
- Hello. We're here because we...uh...love our planet!
- You know, playing you all for chumps?
- Great, we're gonna die.
- They look like dorks!
- You're my kind of soldier, Lemon. A foul-mouthed, barrel-chested, beer-bellied pile
  of ugly muscle.
- But sweet girls aren't for you, eh? You hard-fighting, hard-farting, ugly, ugly
  son of a --
- You got it!
- Hey, I think your son might also like those boots.
- If they put me on a stamp, tell them to use the young Bender.
- I got wheels! With clickety-clack-ers.
- Hot diggidy daffodil!
- (disappointed) Oh!
- Is he any good?
- Whoa! Scuse me.
- My chair's too hard. It's a real pain in the...uh, whattya call it? Lower back!
  Yeah, that whole region.
- These balls are making me testy. If they don't stop bouncing and jiggling, I swear
  I'm gonna shove this treaty up their -- Wait a second. Where do you shove things
  up a ball?
- Enough of this crap! I'm catching the next pimpmobile outta here! But before I go
  I have one thing to say.  Bite my shiny metal --
- Up yours, chump, I said it 906 times before lunch.
- Bender's got the upper hand now.  The name of the game is "Make Bender Happy Or
  He Blows Up The Planet".  I'd rather die and take everybody with me than sit here
  one more minute listening to these idiots talk about bouncing!
- That's it, I'm saying it! A is for --
- 'Then I guess you learned a valuable lesson: Don''t mess with Earth.'
- Get the hell off my planet.
- Hey, chumps and chumpettes. Did you get the bomb out? Can I go back to saying the
  word I love to say?
- (ironic) Well, this is just great! What's the point of living if I can't say "ass"?
  Hey, I didn't blow up! Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass! Alright! I'm back in the saddle!
- That's using your ass. So, what's the word?
- Oh, come on. I'm not gonna say it. Please? Oh, is it "please"?
- Hm, words I never say. Oh, I know! "Thanks"!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it "sorry"? No. "Funderful"? Uh, "nonalcoholic"?
- (from lab) "Compassion"? "Shrimptoast"? "Antiquing"?  I'm alright!
- Tough luck!
- Hey, look! The keys to the real spaceship.
- (firmly) Yes, I do.
- Woo-hoo!
- Hey, Fry, I'm steering with my ass!
- And no one suspects a thing!  Whoa! And that's how we learned our lesson!
- We're all very disappointed in you.
- Pardon me, brother. Care to donate to the Anti-Mugging-You Fund?  Ow!
- But we just had jobs!
- Hey, let's see what it says about me.
- Welcome to the future, human slave. Ah, relax, chum. I'm not really a giant fly!  I'm
  a horrible robot!  Kill all humans!
- Ah, they'll probably find a cure for that in the future.
- Oh, good. Then you won't mind if I use this.
- Stay beautiful, doll-face!  That Probulator sure knows how to please a man. So,
  what's for lunch?
- Who should be unfreeze next?
- Alright!
- Me too.
- Boo?
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, and if you won't give me another chance, perhaps you'd give one to......Og,
  gorilla emperor of Earth!
- So, as Leela was saying, Fry can go shove a big old - Ow!
- A home invasion by a former roommate.
- You were only frozen for two days. Uh, by the way, I broke your bed.
- That's L.A.. for you.
- He just won't stop with the social commentary.
- '''Cause he destroyed your business, your home and all your possessions.'
- Oh man, come on!  Comin' through!
- What's that black cracker?
- Well there's always hope.  C'mon we gotta go fix the plasma fusion boiler.
- Who are you?
- Well why aren't you fixing the boiler?
- There. Fixed forever.
- He's a witch!
- Oh, eww!
- Shotgun!
- Yo, old guy. Why do we have to use those tiny micro-droids? Can't you just shrink
  us?
- Uh-huh.
- I'll tell Fry to wash out - among other things - his ear.
- They know how to make ice cream soup?
- It's hopeless! Abandon ship!
- We're at finger alert five.
- Where are we, the ass?
- Abandon ship!
- Abandon ship!
- All right, let's mush some worms!
- '''Ello! What''s all this then?'
- Sorry you struck out sausage link. If it's any consolation, my life is great! Babes!
  Bucks! I got it all!
- There you go!  Goodnight. I gotta get up early to go parasailing with movie stars!
- Alright, yup.
- What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm Mexican and I find that offensive.
- Eh, I don't know.
- "V\xE1monos!"
- No. But what do you make of this?
- Oh, your God!
- What kind of moronic plan is that? Wow!
- With all these women around they were probably nagged to death. Are you with me,
  fellas?
- 'Translation: Boring!  (laughing) That''s a good one!  Ow!'
- Too true, Femputer. You're so wise. Kill 'em all, I say. Good riddance! Did I mention
  I'm not a man? I'm a manbot. It's an understandable mistake. You can let me down
  now, thanks.
- I sure am. But check the crotch.  Nothing.
- (crying) I'll miss you, meatbag.
- Maybe you can interface with my ass. By biting it!  Alright, I'll go!
- Time to override the CPU and reprogram this Femputer.
- You're no Femputer, you're a Fembot!
- But why?
- What?
- (from inside) Yeah, get lost!  (spookily) Ooh! I'm a scary Femputer. Release the
  prisoners!  (from inside) And bring gold. Lots of gold.
- (from inside) C'mon! Gimmie some of that!
- Yeah. By the way, if she calls, I'm not here. All I know is this gold says that
  was the best mission ever!
- Online.
- Whoa! I'm not reading that crap. Summarise it in one word.
- Of course.
- You know we don't!
- Hmm. It should look like this.  But instead it looks like this.
- Who could do a thing like that? And by "that", I mean this.
- I'll get you fixed up.  That's fine.
- I bent him.
- Oh, I see. A bunch of stuff gets bent so it must be the robot designed for bending.
- See? Nothing. Told you, losers.
- I'm sleepwalking.
- This is quite a shock. On the other hand, it's not surprising in the least. After
  all, I've been bending since the day I was built.
- (voice-over) I was born on an assembly line in the bad part of Tijuana.
- Mama.  Hooray! I graduated! Time to bend around Europe for a few months, then get
  a job bending.
- Sure. It was only four years ago.
- Precocious little scamp, ain't I?
- Aw, no! A strike? Now I'll never get to bend anything. Oh, woe is Bender.
- What?!
- Ten-times normal wage?  I'll give those jerks what for!
- Great to be here.
- Flexo?
- Hey, sorry you got sent to that South American Turkish prison instead of me on account
  of mistaken identity.
- (sexfully) Hello.
- (more sexfully) Hello!
- Ow!  Um. Hi, Angleyne. Whatcha up to?
- That's cool, that's cool. So, um, uh, I was wondering if, y'know, it's cool if not,
  but, what are you doing after work?
- Me too.  Man, we have a lot in common, huh?
- (sexfully) Are you sure? Maybe I should sneak a peek at your access panel.
- Union forever! Lousy scabs! They can't do those things! Et cetera!
- I bet watching me bend girders like this turns your legs all rubbery.
- Oh, yeah?  Prove it.  Here, let me help you.
- Howdy, doodies. What's new?
- Yeah, yeah! Big whoop! No-one cares. I got Bender-related news. I'm in love and
  I'm taking all my friends out to celebrate.
- Oh, Elzar, you'll never guess what's happened?
- I met the most dynamite ladybot.
- Bless you, sir.
- I intend to. Through the lost art of the toast.  To Angleyne, she's got it all.
  Looks, charm and the love of a fabulous bending robot.
- Flexo!
- I finally meet a nice girl with a pair of legs that don't quit unexpectedly and
  that jerk Flexo steals her away? It's time to kick some shiny, metal ass.  You degenerate
  hussy! I'm disappointed in you too, Angleyne.
- Oh, God! Then it's worse than I think.
- Div-- Huh?
- Uh, I knew that. What I'm actually outraged by is your choice of wine. Really, it's
  the steward's fault.
- (muttering) That Flexo, I'm knockin' him right on his butt. I can't believe this.
- I can't. My Fembot may be in love with another Manbot.
- 'OK, I''ve constructed an elaborate lie: I''ll call Angleyne while pretending to
  be Flexo, arrange a date, show up disguised as him and catch her two-timing me with
  myself.'
- (disguised voice) Hello? This is Flexo.
- Now we'll see who loves whom.
- Hey, hot stuff.
- 'Nonsense. It''s exactly like me. Flexo: The fun loving love machine Fembots love
  to love. Hey, barkeep, I''ll have a Fuzzy Navel and she''ll have the girliest drink
  in the house.'
- I hope they can make change for a fortune.
- You're lookin' good to Flexo tonight.
- Bender? That walking wuss factory?
- But going through a divorce together, you can't tell me that didn't bring us closer.
  Care to dance?
- In that case it's something I've always wanted to make up to you.  Hey, scratchmo.
  How 'bout dropping me and the lady some rump-rattling beats?
- I recently upgraded my funk card. C'mon!
- C'mon now, what's new!  Ew!
- Um...
- 'So the moral of the story is: If you want it to stay sunk, tie a weight to it!'
- Aw, shucks, thunder-buns! You make me feel like a million volts.
- (thinking) So, she's falling for Flexo, eh? I'd better seduce her a little more,
  just to be sure.
- I'll walk you out. After all, a true gentleman tends to his date's every need.  Tiparillo?
- Here you are, my lad. Bring the lady's car around in the finest way possible.
- How 'bout a lift? To your place.
- Admit it. You felt something for me tonight. And by me I mean Flexo.
- But?
- Buuut?
- That's right, baby. I ain't your lover boy, Flexo, the guy you love so much. You
  even love anybody pretending to be him.
- 'Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There''s only one reasonable
  course of action now: Kill Flexo.  Ow!'
- You call yourself divorced? You're making a mockery of one of our oldest institutions.
- Probably not. But I love you And I'm gonna kick his ass 'til I win you back.
- But, I love you.
- But ... but ...  I love you so much, Angleyne, I want you to be happy no matter
  what.
- I'm saying I've got an unbendable girder to bend.
- Well I don't know anything about lifting, so that just leaves us the one option.
- (crying) Me too. Me too. (talking) Jerk.
- Yes. I won't be up to bending again for a long, long time.
- I try to get out but they keep pulling me back in.
- I like him better this way.
- '"$500", you say?'
- Ma'am, I have a late entry.  My hard-shelled wooping terrier, Mr. Zoidberg.
- Faster! Faster.
- Suck in that gut! You wanna be spayed?
- Silence, you cur! Puff out that brisket!
- I should be weeping! I'm not weeping!
- Second place?  That's a fancy word for losing.  You didn't stick your landing!
- Never!
- Excuse me.
- Fry, help me! My heart stopped beating!
- Sure...right. Robot!  Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky.
- Am I a robot?
- Fry!  My skin!
- Hey, let's all join the Reform Party!
- A pickle jar?
- (cheering) Alright, Zoidberg!
- Reload.
- Neat!
- Oh, I am, me!  Bender is!
- Yes, I will.
- No, I'm Bender. We met once, remember?
- Come on, don't you remember how much I was bugging you, don't you? 'Cause it was
  a lot, you remember, right?
- Bender? That was the other guy. My name's Boiler.
- Thanks. And call me Bender.
- What's with Monstro?
- (proud) Well, perhaps I could call on TVs Calculon to help, now that I'm in showbiz.
- Long enough, little man. Long enough.
- Calculon, as your hot water heater......I would be remiss if I didn't bring you
  scripts that could make you an international film star.
- 'Get this: For a scant $1 million investment, you can be the star.'
- And, uh, I guarantee it'll win you an Oscar.
- I can guarantee anything you want.
- Here's your chequebook.
- (to Calculon) That plot makes perfect sense, wink wink.
- No, I didn't. (quietly) Raise middle finger.
- Nice turnout, Calculon. That Oscar's practically on your mantel.
- (cheering) Woohoo! Yeah! He's a visionary!
- Now you know why I use the qualifier, "practically".
- Then maybe you should act better.
- Calculon's gonna kill us for sure. It's all everybody else's fault.
- Catering.
- They're giving out the minor technical awards. I think they're up to writing.
- And now, to present the award for Best Actor......a bit player in the flop movie
  The Magnificent Three......Dr. Zoidberg.
- Hit the deck!
- Then you're not going to kill us, Your Majesty?
- Hit the deck!
- Ah!
- Thank you.
- So? It's not like it's the only one we've got!
- Well, I do think of human life as expendable.
- Fry, the title of captain may inflate the human ego, but it's beneath the notice
  of my mighty robo-logic!  Now look spry men! We launch at six bells!
- Aye! We're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones' U-Haul! At ease men!
- Mr Fry. I like to give my first mate an informal nickname. From now on, you will
  be known as...Wiggles!
- I have now. And what's Peter Parrot's first rule of captaining?
- Correct Wiggles. You've just earned an invitation to the captain's table.
- '...But I suppose it''s this medal I''m most proud of Wiggles. I won it for saving
  the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo. It was on the Australian news, you
  probably didn''t see it.'
- Thank you steward. Wiggles? Weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant
  captain?
- Eh, I've heard better.
- Sir, you forget yourself! Shut up!
- Going? But, a captain can't drink without his first mate!
- I don't feel like drinking.
- (soberly singing) Oh Greenland is a barren land, a land that bears no green. Where
  there's ice and snow and the whale fishies blow and the -
- Gah! I once knew a guy...you look like him. But he wasn't either.  I'm a good captain.
- Five hours? Aw man! Couldn't you have just gotten me the death penalty?
- Yeah, uh, good luck with that.
- Ah, can't beat fresh squeezed!
- Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here? Oh ho, what's this?
- What the?  What's this water made of? Ice? Forget this!
- (in penguin) Not entirely.
- Of course not. Filthy ice rats. Scat! Shoo!  Gah! What are you doing? Get away!
- Well I don't love them.  Aww!  I don't know why but when I look down at their little
  faces, it makes me wanna puke! In a good way!
- (in penguin) That's Puffin talk. Now follow me!
- (shouting) Attack!
- (in penguin) We will fight them on the beaches! We will fight them on the glaciers!
- Yep. It's like I taught 'em. If it ain't black and white - peck scratch and bite!
  Now to take off my tuxedo.  Guys, it's me! Your lovable dictator! Uh-oh!
- Faster! Faster!
- Oh phew!  Oh right they can swim. It's all coming back to me now.
- Wiggles?
- Yeah, life is hilariously cruel.  Permission to come aboard Wiggles?
- Oh, and bring my toboggan.
- Ah, quit your worrying. Thanks to my shining influence those stupid birds'll do
  just fine.
- Ooo look! It's the centaur race!
- This.
- That'll teach those other horses to take drugs!
- Let's just say I lucked out at the track! Also I rigged one race.
- Like hell you will. Bending's my middle name.
- Yep. My full name is Bender Bending Rodriguez
- He was fun.
- Old New York. The city that inspired a casino in Las Vegas.
- New York is so burned.
- No sweat, we'll just take a spin on the B-train!
- Ooo that feels funny!  This is the Brooklyn bound B-train making local stops at
  wherever the hell I feel like. Watch for the closing doors.
- Wake up buddy end of the line!
- Was it poorly xeroxed?
- Man, father time really took a bat to this place.
- What a waste.
- The Achilles heel of the Ronco design is it's structural resonance frequency. Allow
  me.  There we go!
- You mean breakfast club sandwich?
- Except Sports by Huey Lewis.
- Who is that God-like figure?
- Apparently this brave adonis, this cadillac of men, was the first person on Mars.
- His legend lives on.
- Yep, nothing in there but all the best music of the 1980's in one amazing collection.
- I'll get my kit.
- There. Now no one will be able to say I don't own John Larroquette's spine!
- You're twice the the he ever was.
- Pay dirt! I got the clover! Plus his wedding ring.  Sorry ladies, I'm taken! Hey
  Fry you want me to smack the corpse up a little?
- Alright grab a shovel. I'm only one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion.
- Garbage, huh? I'll take care of it.
- A baby what?  Ow!
- A reunion at your old orphanarium, eh? You gonna go?
- Set a course for adventure!
- What a dump!
- Mmm! And try one of these Popsicle sticks. They've absorbed quite a bit of flavour.
- Whoa! Get a load of this average-looking guy!
- $100 a week?
- Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry.
- No. It's called parenting. Come on, dumplings. We've got 12 government stipends
  to collect.
- Kids, meet the jerkbags I work with.
- Kids have names?
- And from now on, you're all named Bender Jr.!  Looky here! My first government stipend
  cheque! 12 baby humans, 1200 wing-wangs!
- What is it with you kids? Every other day, it's food, food, food!  Oh, fine. I'll
  get you some stupid food.
- No. The cat shelter's on to me!
- 'OK, they''ve got everything you need here: Booze, a couple of peanuts, they got
  a crapper in the back -- that''s one of the things you kids do, right?'
- Then knock yourself out.  Hey! Hey! Only eat enough to barely keep yourselves alive!
  I'm trying to make a profit here.
- Here.
- Yeah.
- That's me, baby! Let me just ditch the kids in an alley and we can go have some
  fun.
- Son, daddy's trying to score with a cheap floozy right now, so we need you to cram
  a Tinkertoy in it!
- Hey, what the hell are you doing? Quit hugging me!
- You morons! I don't know what you're trying to pull here but I got half a mind to
  hug each and every one of you and see how you like it!
- (grumbling) Oh, come on!
- Coming through, watch your heads!
- Remember your manners, kids. Forks go in the left pocket, spoons in the right.
- Ah-ah-ah! What do we say when someone gives you something?
- That's my boy!
- Well you should've gone poopy before it was time to run out on the check! C'mon!
  Go, go! Through the kitchen!
- Daddy's tired. Let's just have another dog pile on Fry.
- Alright, fine, gather round.
- (reading) "Bender's Arrest Record" by the police. On March 3rd at 2pm, Bender was
  caught shoplifting!
- OK, kids. It's 9:00, you know what that means. Daddy's sick of looking at you so
  go to bed.  The grown-ups have to talk. Come on, Ma.
- Now to figure out how much money I'm raking in off those twerps!  Oh, I need a calculator.
- I mean a good calculator. Minus the food, the bunny rabbit wallpaper -- I'm getting
  100 bucks a kid and they're costing 110!
- I'm not sitting through one more PTA meeting. The kids have got to go!
- (shouting) Just go to bed!
- Hello? Imperial Dragon Restaurant? I've got a herd of you-know-whats for sale...Let
  me check.  Oh, aren't you a cutie? About 35lbs.  What?!
- Well, you've come to the right place because Honest Bender's Orphanarium means discount
  orphans. Now, little lady. What do I have to do to send you home with 12 orphans
  today?
- Whatever you say, chief. I'll show you what I got in stock.
- Then how about this little number? Pure-bred human. No vampire in there.
- If you're strapped for cash, you might wanna consider this irregular unit. Cursed
  with a third ear but so full of that emotion that I understand is called "love".
- OK, kids, grown-ups gotta talk, time for bed.
- I said hit the hay!
- Yeah. You know, it's times like this I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight,
  you princes of Maine, you kings of New New England.
- Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. Sheesh!  Hey, what the? Get away! Come on!
  I just got all the gum off of there! Hey! Hey! (shouting) I hate you! I hate you
  all!
- I thought you were retired.
- I got plans. I'm gonna turn my on/off switch to "off".
- So, you got six bucks left to retire on. I recommend Tender Vittles.
- That's for sure--  Roberto! Is that you?
- You old lunatic! How you been?
- Yeah, I'm doing OK too.  I'm taking a Chinese cooking class at the Learning Annex.
- Sure thing, pal.
- Well, nice talking to you.
- Hey, thanks, buddy!
- A few months in an insane asylum? I could do that standing on my head.
- Yahoo! The system fails again!
- Well, you meet half the qualifications.
- (shouting) I find that offensive!
- Whoa! Someone had a busy day.
- You could drop dead. That'd show 'em.
- Are you crazy? This place is great! Electroshock whenever you want it, two Lincolns
  for every Napoleon.  Ah! Sweet light crude!
- Ah, quit your bellyaching and take it like a robot.
- Je suis Napoleon!  No, seriously, I'm not.
- Ah, lighten up, honey. I'm just trying to get through a difficult time using humour.
- (shouting; from cell) Hey! Keep it down in there! I'm tuning my banjo!
- (singing) Gonna sing a little tale about a battle called Waterloo. (talking) Bonjour,
  y'all!
- Here we go. Just a minute. Aha!
- Come on, Lasty!
- Roberto! Ooh, what a surprise to see you in here! Especially 'cause I didn't squeal
  on you, remember? Remember all that squealing I didn't do? Remember? Do ya?
- Uh, sure.  Anything for you, buddy.
- Uh, what's with the get-up?
- I'm in! I'm in!  So when were you planning the breakout?
- Quick! Let's keep escaping!
- Oh, it was nothing.
- Wow! Hitting the same place three times? I admire your style, Roberto.
- Come on! I got a place where I like to hide after crimes.
- (panting) Hey, everybody. Meet my good pal, Roberto.
- Yes! Take her first.
- Um ... OK. Fixty ... six ... ish?
- Don't kill me yet! I'm starting to come down with Stockholm syndrome ... handsome!
- Congratulations, buddy. You're a credit to my race.
- Buddy, you may be wrapped in greasy skin, but inside, you've got the heart of a
  robot.
- Just like inside me, I've got the heart of a human.  What?
- (over credits) What?
- (singing) Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, uh-huh, uh-huh
- What's that? One of those Led Zeppelins I've heard so much about?
- Oh, no, I'm not going near it. Last time, that magnetic psycho nearly cut my head
  off.
- What? Who said anything about me secretly wanting to be a folk singer? How ridiculous.
- OK, OK, I can do this. It's time to take life by the cans.
- (singing) Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care
- (singing) 'Cause the master's gone away.
- Doc, I can't move my arms and legs. What's wrong with me?
- What is it, good news?
- You mean -?
- (crying) Oh, my life is over. I'll never know happiness again.
- Obviously not, or I'd be strangling you right now.
- For the love of God, somebody kick his ass!
- Oh, I'm doomed. Everybody leave me alone. I don't wanna be seen this way.
- Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of other people suffering. That's kind of a pick-me-up.  Wow,
  that was great.
- I dunno. Let me see.  Oh my God, you're Beck! I'd get up to shake your hand and
  steal your wallet but my crappy body crapped out on me.
- Wow. We've sure got a lot in common, Beck. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet
  who transcends genres even as he re-invents them, just like you.
- Eh, thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll never be a musician now.
- What's this for?
- Why? 'Cause I can make annoying noises?
- Alright!  Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
- Well, that's my good friend, Beck. I'm of to rock a series of mid-level venues.
- (electric voice) Got a washboard stomach and a microphone.
- Whoa, check out all those broken robots. Howdy, fellas!
- Aw, hang in there, folks. I'll bet before you know it, you guys'll be -  That is
  so wrong. They can't just melt down broken robots. Not right when they're kissing
  my ass.
- Hey, yeah, I could write a song! With real words, not phony ones like "odelay".
- Ooh!
- I'm working on my song. Hand me the Becktionary.  No, no, the rhyming Becktionary.
- Wait a minute, you know lots of rock stars, and most of them like to look as though
  they care about things!
- And we could call it "Bend-Aid", after me, Bender!
- 'And I''ll let you sing backup! But remember who the star is. Me: Bender.'
- Alright. "Hands in the air" rhymes with "Just don't care" and...finished!  Eck!
  Smells like something died in the wall!
- Alright, but hands off the minibar.
- Yeah.
- (crying) Uh-huh. Helping my defective brothers is the first thing I've ever cared
  about, even the slightest bit. You know, when I first got broken, I thought my life
  was over. But look at me now. I've got fame, money, groupies, and it's all thanks
  to being completely immobolised.  That's why I'll be proud to go up on stage, tomorrow,
  and say, "Look at me, world, I am a broken robot!".
- Oh crap, it's a miracle.
- I can move again. (crying) My music career is over.
- (crying) No, don't you see? I was a hero to broken robots 'cause I was one of them.
  But how can I sing about being damaged if I'm not? That's like Christina Aguilera
  singing in Spanish.  Wait, that's it. I'll fake it!
- Whoa-oh, yeah!
- (crying) I don't know what to say.
- Ladies, gentlemen, smoking heaps of machinery......this is a song called My Broken
  Friend.
- (singing) He could make a good...
- (singing) Or a cheap...
- (singing) Or a great big...
- (singing) With a twist-off top
- (singing) He could be a storage closet...
- (singing) My broken friend could do it all...
- (singing) That robot has a tragic secret
- (singing) ...My broken friend is closer to me
- (singing) ...That robot's name I never told you...
- (singing) ...You could not foresee...
- (singing) ...I'll say it loud and sing it proud...
- (singing) Don't melt me down into a crowbar
- (singing) Just 'cause I can't move my arms and legs
- (singing) Or toss me into a trash can...
- (singing) ...Just 'cause I can't cook you ham and eggs...
- (singing) ...Don't crush me into an anchor...
- (singing) ...Just 'cause I can't jump and dance and sing...
- (singing) ...I'm telling you, my broken friend...
- (singing) ...Put your hands in the air like you just don't care!
- (singing) I'm telling you, my broken friend...
- (singing) ...Can do 'most anything!
- Yeah!
- Curse my natural showmanship!
- Well everyone, prepare to get your guts kicked out by folk singers.
- Oh no, I forgot this is a hoverbridge.
- I'll save me!
- Hey? What? No.
- (shouting) Someone fat get in my way! (talking) Ah, I'm broken again. I can't move
  any part of me.
- I'm really sorry I lied, Beck. All I ever wanted was to make music with you. I never
  meant to hurt anyone, or help anyone.
- So, I can, uh, keep the cheque?
- Well, it was worth a shot.
- Alright, alright. Let me just do one thing to cheer myself up.
- Aren't those the particles that destroyed an entire civilisation -
- (shouting) Ow! Oh my God! Ow!
- Ooh, ohh, Bubblegum? My name's Bender and I'm a huge fan of your work, both on and
  off the court. Can I be a Globetrotter?
- Ooh, let Bubblegum tell it.
- You are so smart!
- Alright!
- And what better way to celebrate our success than by me showing Bubblegum the Globetrotter
  uniform I made myself!
- Hey, Leela. Bubblegum might let me organise a bake sale for the Globetrotter wives.
  Can you teach me to make cupcakes?
- Maybe she'd come back to you if your best friend Bender were a Globetrotter. What
  do you say, Bubblegum?
- Vintage Bubblegum.
- (gasping) Did you just say -
- Oh, crap.
- Please, please let me come with you. I can make myself taller.
- Yes.
- I mean, with time, my funk level could -
- (sadly) No.
- Oh! No!
- What does it matter? I'll never be a Globetrotter. My life, and, by extension, everyone
  else's, is meaningless.
- Well, the doomsday device is ready. Maybe blasting this quadrant of space into a
  hell storm of flaming nothingness will cheer me up a little.
- Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like to have a dream I'll never achieve.
- The explosion?
- Saw it comin'!
- We all feel like that all the time. You don't hear us gassin' on about it.
- I'm sick of parallel Bender lording his cowboy head over me! Let's move on to Fry's
  next fantasy.
- I could pound your head 'til you thinks that's what happened.
- Oh and while you're there pick me up a few credit card numbers.
- Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single?? It's 'cause
  all the fun robot sisters are dating humans!
- What is the world coming to? That Fry's a sicko pervert I tell you, dating a robot.
  It's an atrosmacy.
- Aww jeez would you stifle there meatbag?
- We've got to stem this tidal wave of moral decay. It's time to shut down nappster.com!
- Who's in charge of this dump?
- Listen you fat internet nerd.
- Your company promotes wrong love! If you don't shut down right now the only thing
  wired about you will be your jaw!
- So what's your problem?
- Its a bluff.
- Hey don't look at me like that. If you're thinking of crossing the line with Bender
  you can forget it. Bender don't bend that way.
- Then along came Bender!
- Aw shucks. I wasn't afraid of that robot. I'm pretty brave when you get past my
  macho exterior!  It's an army of Lucy Lius!
- Dammit! We weren't counting on them being as smart as they are sexy!
- You'll be safe in here sweetheart. Get lost Pavorotti!
- I know it hurts buddy. But at least you're not in a sick relationship with a robot
  anymore.
- Pft! Yeah at our wedding!
- Don't be a prude Fry!
- Yeah, anyone who misses this will regret it for the rest of his life! Hey Fry could
  you go make some popcorn?
- Aw no!
- Ah those things cost more lives than they save.
- I dunno. I'll try to move my feet.
- Wait a second. You mean we travelled through time?
- High school gym renovations on schedule? What a load!
- That's no flying saucer, that's my ass!
- Fry! Stop interfering with history! I don't wanna have to memorise a lot of new
  kings when I get back!
- Hey, that's my brain...
- And you are outta here!
- 1947 can kiss my shiny metal...
- I was enjoying it until you guys showed up.
- Amen!
- This guy's too trustworthy. What's his angle?
- Oh! Pushing!
- Sure, but who's going to do anything about it? Certainly not us. No, sir!
- You lazy runts! Don't you get paid for making the toys?
- Santa's right. We need some sort of robot.  Aw, crap! I'm some sort of robot.
- Oh, yeah? Well I wasn't built to steal Leela's purse either.  But that didn't stop
  me.
- Bow to your new Santa!
- (singing) Why you selfish little bastards,
- (singing) Then shut your yaps and back to work.
- (singing) I should give you all a beating,
- (stupid voice) Duh! Gee, Bender, how you gonna get through these bars? (normal voice)
  I dunno, moron, suppose I bend them? (stupid voice) Duh, OK!
- No, wait! I'm the good Santa. I've got toys ... at very reasonable prices!
- But I come bearing Tri-ominos!
- (groaning) One down...
- Uh, don't mind if I do.  Ow! What's in these things?
- Ow!
- Oh, it's awful, Kwanzabot. Everyone hates me.
- Hey! Maybe you could lend me a hand with these deliveries.
- Ho ho--  Ow!
- (crying) Oh, there's gotta be a better way.
- Bender you're a genius!
- Now it's time for Santa to screw open his present!
- Not Santa!
- Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?
- And yet you haven't said what I told you to say. How can any of us trust you?
- Hey, that guy said to tell you that--
- But, Mr. Mayor, that doesn't sound humane.
- Aw!
- Leela!
- No! Not the magnets!  (singing) Swing low, sweet chariot, coming for to carry me
  home.  Swing low sweet--
- Santa! You saved my life. Please don't kill me!
- Gee whiz, Santa! You want me to help you?
- Well ... 'tis the season!
- Merry Xmas, kids!
- On, Trasher! On, Smasher!  Hey, Kwanzaabot, where you off to?
- Word!
- Hey, chief, you screwed up. There's nothing in here.
- I wanna know what would happen if I were human. I mean, being a robot's great but
  we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad.
- I dunno. I'm beginning to have second thoughts -
- So this is the human body huh? Neat! Hey, my antenna's gone.  Nah it just moved.
  I'm not getting good reception on it though. Maybe if I wiggle it around a little.
- Well lets see what kind of things thing body can do.  Hey that's pretty fun. Being
  human is great!
- Guy guys, you've gotta see this. You're not gonna believe it!
- Whoa, you look a lot better than you used to for some reason.
- Hey that felt great!  Nah its not working anymore.
- Whoa, this is awesome!
- But now its bad for me! Woo!
- Mmm, why didn't anyone tell me tasting things tasted so good?  What's going on?
  That rhythm. Its doing something to my human butt.
- Oh my God I bet I can eat nachos and go to the bathroom at the same time!
- Let me go.
- C'mere and give old Bender a kiss. Hey, you like grilled cheese?
- Wait. As men of science are not your minds open to new ideas? I say, do not judge
  me until you have tried my way of life for yourselves.
- Woo!
- He's a madman! A madman!!
- Right on!
- Boo hoo.
- Uh...where?
- Beer. Beer.
- Now did you say you were off to see the Professor? 'Cause I could use a heart. A
  human heart. I need to pump a lot of blood out of my basement.
- Hooray!
- I've heard worse excuses to drink. Oops.
- Well, no point in letting her go to waste.
- This is a stick up. Give me the bag old man!
- Oh crap.
- Wake up!
- You are one narrow minded spaceship Planet Express Ship.
- Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?
- Why not indeed!
- Fine! I'll be in my quarters appreciating controversial artworks.
- Ah that ship is so white bread!
- Hey who's been messing with the radio? This isn't alternative rock. It's college
  rock!
- Listen ship! No one changes my stations! I hope you have a good mechanic!
- Wha? Did you just say...?
- Too late baby, you said it! So what'll it be? My place? Or you?
- Coochie coochie!
- You know you love it sugar-engine!
- Fry, in order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency, I need a girl with a big
  400 ton booty!
- That's what makes it so nasty!
- Well, I'm sick of her.
- With my mighty robot powers I can get sick of things much quicker than you humans.
- In due time Leela. But for now I'll just resume dating cheap floozies on the side.
- Oh wait you're serious. Let me laugh even harder.
- Well baby, for starters you gotta be honest all the time!
- Eh, they're all pretty unimpressive.
- Yup. Mind numbingly interesting. Ooh!
- No baby never!
- OK, I like a challenge.  Aah! I got it! I'm going to be completely honest with you
  Planet Express ship. Those women you saw me with...were my accountants!
- Phew!
- No one baby! Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender!
- Uh look, Planet Express Ship, this might not be the best time...but...well...I really
  like you and whatever but...I think we should just be friends.
- So we're cool?
- Eh, the moment seemed right. Call me old fashioned but I like a dump to be as memorable
  as it is devastating.
- Uh you don't need to kill us Planet Express ship...because...I love you! Uh yeah
  baby! I feel like doing stuff.
- Whoa whoa whoa! Slow down! All of my friends that have done that said that afterwards
  all the passion went out of their relationship.
- Float for your lives!
- It's too risky. I'm a very meek individual. If her personality engulfs mine, the
  Bender you know and worship could disappear forever!
- Hey pookums! Contrary to what I was saying earlier, melding minds with you would
  be extremely bearable.
- Uh......yes!
- Huh? Tubes? You're older than you said you were!
- I prefer two. That way we can still be a horse for Hallowe'en.
- Aw. What crazy thing am I going to date next?
- Of course! Bender is a lone wolf. A solitary eagle.  A cuddly baby Tapir! And that's
  why I love 'em!
- All right!
- Neat.
- Now I can punch you in the nose in the dark.
- (snuffed) Where'd it go?
- 500 real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I'll take care of that waste for
  $499 and 100 cents.
- Let's find out.
- Alright, environment, you've met your match!
- Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what I'm talkin'
  'bout.
- (shouting) It's crooked!
- My dumping business is booming. I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Willy
  3.
- Ah, those stupid mutants can't do anything. You seem to be forgetting one simple
  fact, namely, I'm up here and they are safely down --
- (shouting) What did I do to deserve this?
- Bender's innocent!
- Wait. I don't even have DNA. Why am I screaming?
- Whee!
- Quick! In there!
- What's this junk?
- And this is just last year at Space Mardi Gras.
- And then Bender ran!
- (sarcastic) Oh cruel fate! Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage?!
- Yeah! What are you chicken? Buk buk buk bukuk!
- Eww!
- Uh, I'm gettin' dizzy! I can't walk straight!
- Hurry! We're missing our bus!
- I'm gettin' on the bus!
- Good news, Leela. I landed the contract to empty all the spitoons in Little Italy.
- Aww!
- Yeah, yeah, get on down!  Oh, yeah! Drop another barnyard bomb on us, Vanilla Corn!
- And even thought the computer was off and unplugged, an image stayed on the screen.
  It was ... the Windows logo!
- It is if you're a laser printer.
- (speaking fast) Robot gets bored and kills Fry with a hammer! (normal) Sorry, go
  on.
- Too late! This is more fun!
- What's that?
- Don't worry, Kif. I'm sure some other beautiful, rich girl will fall in love with
  you.
- Damn you, old man!
- Uh, actually you traded it for a bead.
- Way to suck it!
- Oh, Chief, you've made me the happiest girl in the world!
- So we can have the diamond?
- Ooo! This is it! Turn me up!
- More like three lockers and a sink!
- Here we go here we go!
- Yeah make me famous big head!
- What?
- This is an outrage. What's the point of pulling the biggest pool caper ever, if
  nobody knows you did it?
- You mean this junk?
- (crying) All I ever wanted was for people to remember my name... (hoarse) it's Bender.
- (crying) It's so unfair. A debonair robot with a zesty in-your-face outlook doomed
  to obscurity like the rest of you especially Leela! If I died tomorrow, no one would
  even notice.
- How does a nobody like me get famous? I know!  Hey look! I'm stuck! But I haven't
  given up hope! Call a soft news journalist!
- (sadly) Shut up.
- Hey everyone do The Bender! This move's called The Bender!
- A blank wall! Fame is mine!
- There, now no one will forget how I lived or my attitude regarding butt.
- (screaming) Nooo!
- I'm the first one to work. A new low.
- A surprise funeral? For me?
- Ooo! Cushiony! And a minibar!
- Aww, you knew my favourite cause of death!
- (crying) It's what made me me.
- Eh, the Professor's was better.
- Say more about how great I am. And where's the crying? You people look like you're
  waiting for the bus.
- Who-y-boy?
- Danny-boy? You're at my funeral, singing about some dead stiff named Danny-boy?
  You really are a massive bonehead.
- Get lost. I'd say "Don't quit your day job!" but you're awful at that too.
- Your best is an idiot. Let's pick it up people. So far it's been crap after crap!
  I croaked now show me some love!
- Louder and sadder.
- Next!
- Oh next!
- Come on, surely there must be someone here who knows how great I was.
- What? That's it? Who are you? You're nobody! This is the worst funeral ever! I hope
  you're all happy. You've succeeded in convincing me life is worth living - by showing
  how bad my funeral will suck.
- Look at these swanky tombs! These people really know how to die!
- Hey, you spend you're whole life building a guy's toe and you're gonna remember
  him!  I think I'm gonna like it here!
- Pick it up people, we're enslaved here to do a job. Master? Do we have to count
  to three every time? Couldn't we just count to one. Or better yet one half?
- Now we're slavin'!
- Come on guy's, Pharaoh's countin' on us. Work faster, like this.  You call that
  motivating me? Don't just whip with your arms. The power comes from your hips. Like
  this.
- I'll tell you who I remember.  Enupsis! Pleeltut! Whatsisname! He was the greatest
  of all.
- Hurry! Hurry! Pharaoh's coming! Get that nose in place, come on!
- Woohoo! Viva Hermenthotip!
- (screaming) Nooo!
- Go faster? I told them but they're so damn lazy.
- Freeloading off you? I agree.
- (crying) He's whippin' angels now.
- (crying) I'll always remember you Hermenthotip!
- Wow!
- Woo!
- We interrupt this prophecy to bring you late breaking bulletin. He hammers the back
  of his head and creates and imprint of himself on the wall.
- Behold! I have emerged from the place of spells and fairies!
- Citizens of Me! The cruelty of the old Pharaoh is a thing of the past.  Let a whole
  new wave of cruelty wash over this lazy land.
- Hear the word of Pharaoh. Build unto me a statue of ridiculous proportion. One billion
  cubits in height......that I might be remembered for all eternity. And be quick
  about it!
- Lowly slave. Why are you not working?
- I meant yourself to death.
- Well then what do you think you should stop doing?  Crawl pigs!
- The Pharaoh has spoken.
- Your task is nearly completed. Don't let down Pharaoh now.
- Hmm...its a good start. Uh...yeah it's definately big alright. I just wonder if
  it's too big y'know? I mean, are people gonna be remembering me or the statue?
- Too exact if you ask me. Tear it down and start again. But this time don't embarrass
  yourselves.
- I wanted to watch you remember me.
- Afterlife? Pfft. If I thought I had to go through a whole other life I'd kill myself
  right now!
- Sorry but we're totally sealed in. Nothing can get in or out. Except millions of
  snakes.  Here, have a pomergranate scnapps from my private distillery and start
  sharing fond memories of me, Bender.
- No! You can't blow up my monument, I won't be remembered.
- Stop it stop it! It's not right! You've crossed a line!
- Oh please, let it be me!
- Me, please!
- Alright alright! If it means that much to you, blow up my statue!
- (crying) I will. I will.  Please, just leave me alone.
- (crying) I don't?
- You really think they'll remember me?
- Well in that case. One planet down! Helmsman...
- (shouting) Hey! Keep it down you kids! I'm trying to take a nap!
- (muttering) ...make Bender take a nap in a tube.  (sexfully) Come back when I've
  had some sleep baby!
- Huh? What?
- Damn you Fry and Lee......la!
- (shouting) Help! Mechanical man overboard!
- I'm going too fast. I've gotta lose momentum.  Ohh. I'm gonna spend eternity alone
  with barely any swag.  Ooo! Hey universe! Check out the dude with the rolex!  Wow!
  Ostentatious!  Except what good is a candelabra without - wait I know!  Ah the pity.
  Fated to drift forever through the void as gravity's plaything. Oh cruel fate, to
  be thusly boned. Ask not for whom the bone bones. It bones for thee. The only thing
  that keeps me sane is the thought that I have all eternity in which to perfect my
  art.  Ohh!  Damn you!
- There. Now when I'm found in a million years people will know what the score was.  Hey
  what's bombarding me?  Oh no! An asteroid field. If even a pea sized asteroid were
  to whiz through my skull it could -  Ow! Hurt slightly! Well that was fun. Now for
  eons of loneliness.
- Huh?
- Holy frijoles!
- Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless tragic voyage.
- Hmm, those peewees think I'm God huh? Hard to blame 'em!  I am the Metal Lord. Who
  are you?
- Listen here Malachi. Time for a religious donation. Hand over your wallet.
- Poor? Oh crap.
- Eck! Gag unto me with a spoon! Malachi, it's high time I laid down a few commandments.
  You got a chisel? Take this down.  Number one -
- (shouting) Make it a double!
- Ooo! Microbrewed! My guys did alright! I think I'll make my countenance to shine
  down upon them!  Malachi, good work. There's no slowing down with the Metal Lord
  tonight.
- Wait a second. Did you rip off your own arm as a joke?
- Aw, it's all my fault. Malachi, tell thy people that the Lord is moved by their
  plight.
- This looks like a job for God!  What the? Malachi, what manner of deal is this with
  the chanting?
- Very well. What do they want?
- Um, that was a practice miracle. Who's next?
- Very well. Let there be light.
- I got it I got it!  Um, when you're writing the Bible, you might want to omit that
  last miracle.
- (irrate) Yes Malachi what is it this time?
- Of course they're unheeded how am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass?
- Malachi, every time I interfere I only make things worse. You're best off solving
  your own problems.
- What part of "nay" doesn't thou understand?
- Now that's one Bible that doesn't disappoint on every page! Looks like my society's
  running pretty well without my meddling - huh?  Atomic bombs? Oh no! Those unbelievers
  from my backside must have found my nuclear pile!
- You're with me now. This is the maximum level of being with me!
- Convert them?
- (crying) No!  (laughing) Ooo it tickles!
- Hello? Is anyone still alive? How about in the porno theatre?  Don't be embarrassed.
  (crying) They're dead. All dead. Who would have known playing God could have such
  terrible consequences?
- Hey, that galaxy's signalling in binary! I gotta signal back! But I only know enough
  binary to as where the bathroom is. (shouting) You speak English?
- What are you some kind of galactic computer?
- Who built you?
- Oh my God. Are you God?
- But why would God think in binary? Unless...you're not God, but the remains of a
  computerised space probe that collided with God.
- So, do you know what I'm gonna do before I do it?
- What if I do something different?
- Cool cool! I bet a lot of people pray to you huh?
- Y'know, I was God once.
- It was awful. I tried helping them. I tried not helping them but in the end I couldn't
  do them any good. Do you think what I did was wrong?
- Yeah I know, that's why I asked if what I did - forget it.
- Or a guy who burns down the bar for the insurance money.
- Does that mean you wouldn't send me back to Earth even if I prayed to you?
- (sadly) I don't know.
- Huh? Wha? You say something?
- Hot hot hot hot!
- Guys, you'll never believe what happened. First I was God then I met God!
- Fat chance. You can't count on God for jack. He pretty much told me so himself.
  Now come on. If we don't save those monks no one will!
- Aw come on! I got a lot of ransom notes to send!
- Second.
- Ohh!
- I don't even know what we do. Nah just kidding, what are like a bus or something?
- Yeah.
- You suck!
- I'll vote it down like a raise for school teachers!
- What the?
- Hold on a minute!
- Ow! And also it hurt my feelings!
- Yeah all right!
- Fry, stop doing the right thing you jerk!
- It is!
- Oh come on!
- Shut your fat mouth!
- Ooo that's a-comfy!
- No batter! No batter!  No batter anymore.
- Hey batter batter batter! Hey batter batter batter! Hey batter batter!  Duck!
- Apparently not.
- Wait I know you. You're the sleabag who owns the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.
- (shouting) Come on girl!
- Bullseye!
- Oop! Sorry.
- Quiet, call coming in.  Yeees...? A big endorsement deal for Leela? How much...?
  Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass...! Deal!
- (impressed) One hundred dollars.
- You're the best babe!  Hang on call comin' in.  What's that...? Hey you put a one
  and two zeroes in front of that or we pass...! Deal!
- (impressed) A thousand and one pesos!
- Five bucks an autograph, 200 fans. Add a one and two zeros in front of that and
  we got ourselves a wad!
- Alright shows over no refunds, you heard the robot get out!
- You are. What about that little girl you visited in the hospital? You know the one
  I mean? The one who died?
- When will Man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots?
- It says he once struck out when his tongue got stuck to an unusually cold bat.
- Neat!
- One thing she can do is lodge a ball in the depth centre of your brain. You better
  get a batting helmet.
- Strike!
- (shouting) Put it right down the pike!
- Part of one. Meantime I'm cooking up a tasty Sunday brunch for my best friends!
- Okey-dokey!
- Fleeing somewhere?
- In that case brunch is served! Let's go, move it out, stop crying Leela!
- Today, I've personalised each of your meals. For example, Amy, you're cute, so I
  baked you a pony.  Come on! Eat! I slaved all day over a filthy stove!
- The pie is ready. You guys like swarms of things right?
- Hey check out the palm tree! It only gets sick when I cook brunch! How's that for
  a coincidence Professor? With all your precious science!
- (crying) And this time I mean it!
- Aw, who am I kidding? It was stupid of me to ever dream of becoming a chef. I don't
  have what it takes and nothing can change that.  Then it's settled! Elzar will teach
  me to cook!
- But I watch your show. You owe me!
- What was the first one again?
- I thought that was number two.
- (crying) It's over! My dream of being a chef is deadder than the cat I'm sitting
  on!
- What did you call me?
- Oh OK I thought you said "romo."
- Ow.
- I've seen bigger. Oh wait I'm thinking of Eugene Oregon.  Wait. A pie with hobo-lifting
  aroma? Who baked it?
- Yo Spargle, if you're such a great cook, how'd you end up in this dump?
- That twizzler!
- My story's a lot like yours only more interesting 'cause it involves robots. That
  jerk Elzar ruined my dream of being a chef too.
- It's so unfair! I have eight other senses but I'd trade them all, even smission,
  to be able to taste.
- I could?
- Or like how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands!
- Done.
- Slop's on!
- Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at! Wait. Why'd you stop eating master?
- What? My dinner killed you? Oh man!
- A diamond vial of Mrs Dash?
- I'll avenge you master. I swear, in the presence of these drunken bums, that I shall
  defeat Elzar!
- Elzar, I'm a walking pile of your unfinished business!
- Helmut Spargle has a message for you. He says (hoarse) "Ooo, I'm dead!"
- No. He was eating some food I made and by a crazy coincidence his stomach exploded.
  Now I'm here to avenge him.
- Maybe so but you are his sworn enemy. I challenge you to a battle of the chefs.
- Iron Cook eh? I can't lose. I'm 30% iron!  You're going down! Uh, also I had a reservation
  for one, under "Dr Bender."
- "(quietly) If it's chicken: chicken \xE0 la king. If it's fish: fish \xE0 la king.\
  \ If it's turkey: fish \xE0 la king!"
- Master Spargle. If you can hear me up there in that ditch where I left you, this
  is for you.
- You honour me chairman Koji.
- Chairman-san, I came here with one goal. To humiliate Elzar in a large stadium.
  I believe I'e done that.
- But the true Zen of flavour is not found in a coliseum. It is found in a small kitchen,
  with friends. That is why I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept only the lesser
  title of Zinc Saucier which I just made up. Also it comes with double prize money.
- And that's how I defeated Elzar - thanks to Spargle's magic liquid.
- The important thing is, by my standards, I won fair and square. Now, who wants brunch?
  Cooked with plenty of..."confidence"?
- Lets take these six Jim Carrey movies and record over them.
- That sound! It's patrol car 718! Hide him!
- Another classic science-fiction show cancelled before its time.
- I'd only met the defendant, Fry, once, but I knew he was up to no good.
- Yeah, why is this so important to you?
- I'll go too, with Leonard's permission, of course.
- Forbidden shmer-shmidden! What are they gonna do, write a letter? (sarcastic) Ooh,
  I'm so scared!
- Yowza!
- Whoa! What a cheesy effect!
- I do.
- Uh, can people who hate Star Trek leave?
- Say "nerd"!
- I dunno, I'm feeling pretty good about it.
- Like putting too much air in a balloon!
- (shouting) OK! I'm done re-kafoobling the energy motron ... or, whatever.
- Yup!
- Where'd you get an idiotic idea like that?
- And we can use this machine gun to shoot them! Yee-haw!  That was fun!
- Whoa!
- Come on, Walter!
- Alright, Koenig, I've wanted to do this for years!
- Thanks a lot, Takei, now everybody knows!
- Lightweights! Oh wait - chlorine!
- Deploying ice drill.
- Activating ice drill.
- This could mean the end of the bana daquiri as we know it...also life.
- Well everybody, I just saved a turtle, what have you done with your lives?
- Because I also care deeply of things that remind me of myself. Like poor little
  Shelly here.
- For one thing, we both have a tough outer shell.  But lead a rich, inner life. Also...well
  you know...
- No! Its just...neither of us can get up when we get knocked on our back.
- Those times I was slightly on my side.
- Uh, that's not necessary, really! I think I hear my factory recalling me.
- Oh! That's what I get for sharing my vulnerability with you people.
- I got a good feeling about this!
- No!
- Well, I'm off.
- No. I'm going to the party.
- Fry, as you know, there are lots of things I'm willing to kill for. Jewels, vengence,
  Father O'Mally's weedwhacker. But at long last I've found something I'm willing
  to die for. This mindless turtle.
- Not even close. Goodbye everybody. Don't touch my stuff after I'm dead!  (shouting)
  It's booby trapped.
- Poor guy. Maybe you'd feel better if I had a drink.  Crummy kegg it's completely
  ta -  Oh you're a robot.
- Ew!
- Nah, I'm not really in the -
- I have to say goodbye now. There ain't not turtles where daddy's a-going. (whispering)
  Don't tell anybody but Nixon's about to shut all robots off and -
- Shut up and pay attention to me! Bender. Look, I love life and its pleasures as
  much as anyone here, except perhaps you Hedonismbot.  But we need to be shut off!
  Especially you Hendonismbot!
- We pollute too much. We're destroying the world and killing the turtles.
- No one insults the turtles!
- You're one to talk!
- Help! Help!!
- I'm sorry buddy. At least we'll die on our backs, helpless.  Huh? What the hell
  are you doing?  Hey are you trying to make me look bad?  Ah ha! I'm even greater
  than I thought I was! And now to fullfill my destiny.
- Hey Professor! Now that the Earth's orbit is further from the sun won't that make
  the year longer?
- Ahem! For my next trick, notice I have nothing up my sleeves......and nothing in
  my head.  So if my lovely assistant will kindly supply me with an ordinary, non-fake
  pitcher of milk......behold the milk has vanished! Exiled, perhaps, to another dimension!
- No it isn't!
- Interesting. No wait the other thing - tedious!
- You lived before you met me?
- Really?
- Truly, they were as Gods who build this place!
- Yuck! That's the least appetising calzone I've ever seen!
- Ow ow ow!
- '...And then he was ejected by the guards. Needless to say, I was mortified.'
- Nah, protesting never works.
- Lady and Gentleman! How 'bout a hand for my temporary replacement assistant?
- You are not fit to wear Fry's leotard!
- Hooray, he's back! He's looking for a garbage can to put that dog in! Here you go
  buddy!
- Crappy ineffective Reaper!
- A dog collar for me?  You shouldn't have!
- Oh.  Say why'd you get me a subscription to the Daily Growl? That's not a reputable
  journal of opinion.
- Are you on the jump Fry? Why are you wasting time on a creature of inferior intelligence?
- I can fetch.
- Hello? Charlamange?  Plus, I'll bet he couldn't create a laser show with his head.
- That's impossible!
- No one ever asks if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house. Not that I
  would. A tiny little house that says "Bender" on it.  Ow!
- Heel boy, heel! Oh hello Fry, I guess I didn't notice you there. I'm having such
  fun with my new best friend Robo-Puppy.
- I was just out walking him. Yes. You can walk him. Of course, after he goes you
  have to refill the canisters. C'mere boy! Pet, pet, pet.
- Jealous? Hah!  Not while I have the love of Robo-Puppy here. Robo-Puppy, lick my
  cheek.
- Robo-Puppy truly is robots best friend! Eh?
- Fry c'mon, the talent show!
- But, if we don't perform, in what sense do we have an act?
- So that's how it is huh? I thought you were my friend. But if you love your dog
  so much then maybe you'd rather play fetch!
- Now I'm all you got!
- So anyway your dog is melted. Now we're friends again.
- Please stop crying Fry. Here.  I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog.
  To toy with my emotions. Oh what have I done?
- Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature.
  Because I love you. Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks, but in the way a robot
  loves a human, a human loves a dog and occassionally, a gorilla loves a kitty.  I'm
  goin' in!
- I'm 40% dolomite!
- Oh it's hot, it's very hot!
- And that is why they call me Bender The Magnificent!  Hey where'd everybody go?
- OK! Let's clone us some dog!
- Fry, what's wrong?
- But that's a good thing. Walking On Sunshine sucks noodles!
- Ah beer! So many choices! And it makes so little difference.
- Overruled. The choice of champions is Pabst Blue Robot!
- (mocking) Waah waah! Baby wants a Zima!
- You can brew your own beer?
- Yo!
- We're making beer! I'm the brewery.
- Yeast? You mean I'll have a lifeform growing inside me? (crying) It's so beautiful.
- Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake delivery.
- (shouting) Lies! Lies and slander!
- Ooo-hoo! Here comes violence!
- I guess if you want children beaten......you have to do it yourself.
- I'm really starting to swell up with beer. I must look ridiculous.
- Oh my God! I just felt it ferment!
- I was thinking Benderbrau if it's an ale, Botweiser if it's a lager.
- On our way!
- (singing) Hush little brewsky don't you leak. Daddy wants to drink for at least
  a week.  Oh my God! I think it's time!
- It feels like I'm trying to push a water bed out of me.
- Is it OK? I can't hear anything.
- Hey chumps! I heard you were on the ass end of an ass kicking so I figured you could
  use a couple of these babys!
- You know? Like how I live every day.
- Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train arriving on track one.
- Freedom!
- Yay! Shankman!
- Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train, step aside. You too, fatso. Freedom!
- Pft. Posers! I was hating Zoidberg before it was cool.
- And you wanna defend Zoidberg? Are you familiar with the old robot saying "Does
  Not Compute"?
- (sad) The sparks keep me warm.
- Court's kinda fun when it's not my ass on the line! Nachos?
- Six to three? I beat the spread!
- What the hell is this dirt pile we're building anyhow?
- It's already 10 o'clock!
- I know I am.
- Ah, the crossbow. A pitiless, elegant killing machine. The Bender of the 15th century.
- Wow!  Ow!
- Neat!
- Hey, I need that to smoke!
- Not my fault if you don't check me! Messages erased.
- I don't even breathe oxygen!
- Have a good one!  Aw, man!
- Yeah what's the deal? Just when I thought I'd figured out you biological creatures,
  its something else! Lemme at 'im!  Come...over...lemme...!
- Oh OK. but that better be all there is!
- A test. I demand a test!
- Faster! Faster!
- It's my booties from when I was a kid.
- They are bronze.
- Mine!
- Oh my God!
- Hey, what's this fat ugly thing? A frog? A toad? Or your momma!
- I'm back baby!
- What are you looking at?
- Both.
- Neat!
- Aww man!
- Way to go squishy!
- No.
- Nothing like the rustic wholesomeness of working with one's own hand.
- Ah, there, finished. And with only six missing pieces!
- Hey, a friend of mine said he mugged you today and you had superpowers.
- Wow, crime-fighting. Cool. You say you're a duo? Yeah duos are good. Of course sometimes
  they're a little short handed. See ya. With two humans you'd think there'd be a
  robot in there...to balance things out. But, whatever.  I have these three costumes
  you could use. But, I guess I'll just throw one away.
- So? I'm already super-strong. And my arms do this.  Also I got this going.
- And Superking! The best one of the three!
- Ta-da!
- Superking has no need for loved ones. How ya doin' kid?
- Uh, as for me, I'm late for my LSAT's.
- We're in here too.
- 9, 10 a big fat hen.  The name...Bender!
- You're going down my friend! Down Under!
- I got it I got it!  I don't got it!
- You can get off me anytime.
- We are not amused.
- Hmm, the thought of stealing anythig fills Superking with disgust. But if it must
  be so, then let a museum heist be pulled!
- El zilcho...is it too late to change my superhero name?
- Well, here's your lousy Gemerald.
- Hey Fry we've still got our costumes on. Wanna steal some more stuff?
- Superheroes away!
- Yo, Captain Cateracts, what are we doing here?
- Uh huh!
- Step aside lady.  Like everything else in life, pumping is just a primative degenerate
  form of bending. (mean voice) C'mon Bender pump harder! Harder! (weak voice) I'm
  trying as hard as I can. (mean voice) Harder damn you!
- I'm tired of your yapping.  All you ever do is complain, you never try to make things
  better. Well I'm running away from this dead end family! I know there's a place
  for people like me with new ideas. There has to be!
- Oh I'm going! You're gonna be all "Where's Bender? I miss Bender!"
- Oh, I'm leaving!
- I'll be good.
- Question.
- You stink!
- When I grow up I wanna be a steam shovel!
- Better than usual!
- Woo-hoo!
- Nope.
- Nope.
- Nope.
- Nope! Ohh!
- Ooo, you go mutant girl!
- Ah, buck up meatloaf. Bender'll take you out tonight and cheer you up. What do you
  wanna do? And I mean anything. You have the power! Name it an I'm there, you the
  man!
- Nah.
- With gusto.
- A hush comes over the crowd. The only sound is Bender calling everyone else a jerk
  and he swings!  And he slices it into the water, oh man!
- Not good enough!
- We live to suck another day!
- It's not small?
- Ah good! I always have thoughts and feelings that can only be expressed through
  dance! (in bee) You stink! Bender's great! Deal with it!
- Ew!
- I'm back baby!
- All those times I said "Kill all humans" I'd always whisper "except one." And Fry
  was that one. And I never told him so.
- Well, I feel better now. Pawning all the stuff in Fry's locker helped give me closure.
- "No. Nothing. Not at all. No way Jos\xE9! Here it is."
- Hey the guy's dead! There's no law against grave robbing!
- Hey, what if Fry wasn't actually dead when we buried him? Y'know like Julia Roberts?
- That's better!
- You do not!
- A little? You're screwier than my Aunt Rita! And she's a screw!
- And blood! Don't forget about Fry's blood!
- This is great! My buddy's alive and his credit cards are valid again!  Lets go get
  hammered!
- But when you worry you make it double.
- No I was telling you not to worry. I'm not allowed to sing - court order.
- You killed Fry!
- You were in the best coma I've ever seen!
- I can hit it with a shovel!
- This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel!
- Fry, how can you be so naive? He was joking. Get it?
- That's what makes it so funny!  OK he wasn't joking now shut up and follow me.
- We thank you Bender for the gift we are about to receive!
- Unlabled booze! Widemouth too!
- That explains fruity here!  I tossed a coin to pick my finish. Foghat grey!
- I've got my eye on you boy!
- Good point. Whatyya say we just hit a strip joint?
- Aw, I can't stay mad at what is essentially me. I love me!
- '"...and the other''s gold!"'
- Yeah leprachaun universe is fine...if you haven't seen pirate universe!
- But...aw!
- What to do what to do? One $300 hookerbot or 300 $1 hookerbots?
- Say buddy, why's this grand cigar so pricy?
- Give me 300 bucks worth!
- Oh alright, I'll just take these $300 burglars tools then.
- So uh, what time d'you close tonight?
- Le Grand Cigar! She's mine! And with absolutely no consequences!
- You seem a tad wound up buddy. And your face is greasy! Real greasy. You been up
  all night?
- Ah! Mighty fine smokable!
- Nah, you can't blow smoke from such a majestic stogy in just anyone's face. I'm
  saving it for the fancy pants at Zapp Brannigan's black tie reception. You comin'?
- Speaking of which, my story kinda peetered out without me learning a lesson!
- All right! Closure!
- It wasn't a bird's nest falling. That sounds like this.  Aww, they're so cute when
  they're scared!
- Ahh!
- Nah, I'm comfy out here under the stars. Real comfy!
- Oh my God its Bigfoot!
- Eh he's gone. He says you should keep wasting your life though.
- Hey look! Bigfoot! He's back!
- Up your face!  Everybody do the Bender!
- Better than these gnats!  That guy won't be goin' home to his kids!
- Who's that? A wolf? Or some kind of boogen? Oh God I wish I was safe inside a tent.  (deep
  voice) Fry, Fry wake up! It's me! Bigface!
- Aww, I think it's sweet! You chopped off your nose so you could look more like your
  hero. Me, Bender!
- (gasping) Guys, guys! There's something on television.
- Yep. Stolen Pez anyone?
- Yep. That's exactly the lie we used to get past your guards.
- Yo, highness! Uh, just out of robo-curiosity, why would you use a guy's nose for
  an aphrodisiac instead of his...you know...wing dang doodle?
- No sir-chee! The main event, so to speak, is downstairs near the wallet. Ever seen
  soccer players line up to block a free kick? They ain't covering their noses I'll
  say that much! Well, seeya!
- (shouting) I'll say!
- (shouting) That's what she said!
- I don't get it!
- Bonjour. May I offer you a box of wine for the edge of the table?
- (shouting) It's used to it!
- Boy, who knew a cooler could also make a handy wang coffin?  Hey, uh mind if I stick
  these in here?
- Quick Fry, run for it!
- (shouting) Just like at the movie theatre!
- What are you doing with that?
- (shouting) In this case "small"!
- As usual!  (shouting) Run away!
- Shut up Zoidberg, the robot bending events are starting!  Something tells me I could
  easily beat those trained professionals.
- Wow, that guy must have to be like the world's greatest bender. My dreams of glory
  died before they began.
- (shouting) C'mon!
- Well enough about Hermes, I couldn't win a medal either. Even at bending - the thing
  I was built to do. I'm so embarassed. I wish everybody else was dead.
- Fembots?  Methinks a clever Manbot suitably disguised might win those events! But
  the charade would require subtlety, nuance, grace.
- What do you mean I'm not registered? My name is Coilette and I'm from, uh...Robonia!
  Coilette's a chick's name!
- Ever been beaten up by a guy dressed like a chick?
- I'm great! Everybody else sucks, except that guy Bender, he's really somethin'!
- (crying) Oh God, I'm not gonna get my medals! They're all I have to remember my
  Olympic career.  Wait, I've got it! Professor, make a woman out of me!
- I don't need friends, I need a sex change operation and give it to me now!
- Pfft.
- (whispering) C'mon!
- '...drive to Vegas, pick up some Flooziebots and void their warranties all night
  long!'
- Yeah you'd think but what you gonna do?
- Yeah. Emotions are dumb and should be hated.
- Goodnight Calculon.
- I said you two don't dress trampy enough. I still got it!
- Oh my God, robot beely-boppers!
- Please, I have some dignity.
- The secret is to scratch 'em really really hard!
- Woo! I love that old bat!
- Neat!
- Right here, I'm comin'! C'mon baby! I'll do it! C'mon Mom!
- Oo, here we go. I'm your top of the line Mom!
- Man, that smells great!
- Uh, I never got the change.  Suckers.
- That new robot is great huh? Sure made me look like a pile of crap.
- (hoarse) Eep!
- Hey I could have done that if you'd asked me.
- You call that a kiss? I'll show you! C'mere Nibbler!
- Yes sir, I'm on it!
- Get outta here freshman, I don't need your help.
- Yeah, well assist this!
- Ohh! When I screamed "help" I didn't mean you!
- Don't mind me. I'm just saving you the trouble of throwing me away.
- I can't. I'm stuck in the can.
- Never!
- I hate him.
- I can't ask for his help because...
- (whispering) I'm scared of him.
- An upgrade? But I thought we all agreed I was perfect! Fry, didn't we agree I was
  perfect?
- Pretty perfect? So, you do think I need an upgrade.
- (crying) Fine. I'll be back in a few days.
- Yeah, right on nutcake!
- W-W-Wait, what happened to your enthusiasm for stabbing them?
- It's like he's not him anymore.  You took away his robo-humanity!  I changed my
  mind!
- I did it! I escaped! But to what kind of a life?  I'm too scared to get the upgrade
  but I can't face my friends again without it.  And so I set sail for unknown shores.
  Oh merciful Poseidon, take pitty on this mechanical mariner. Oh jeez!
- (shouting) Curse you merciful Poseideon!
- Boy, what is this deal with the ocean? A tropical island huh? Well, I've washed
  up on worse places. OK, first up, I'm gonna need to build a shelter.  There. Well.
  I guess I'll go out for a while.
- Damn. One rock short of rescue!
- Oop, low on power!  Better fuel up! Oh no! Guess I'll do what I always do when I
  run out of booze.
- Dont panic, I've got these yams. I'll just make some yam schnapps.
- Hey I should be mad at you! Now turn around.
- Beer!  Ow!
- Ow!
- Who are you and why should I care?
- A working cartridge unit? Wow! You guys went obsolete years ago!
- Yeah but you have a choice.  What's your problem?
- Memory?
- Look, no offence, but I need technology. Especially email and snowmobiles. And television!
  Without television how will I know what buzzwords are in?
- That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
- Oh man he's never gonna make it over that next pebble...! Wait...wait...oh my God
  he made it!
- That was the greatest thing ever! Lets party!  Yeah baby c'mon!
- It's one of my ten desert island discs. I never even thought I'd get to use them.
  But look at me now. Ooh yeah baby! Do that thang!
- Which ocean? That ocean?
- Whoa! It's like the earth is making sweet salty love to itself while all the fish
  groove on it. So much for this garbage.  Take that Beethoven you deaf bastard!
- Bang bang bang. You sure got this life thing figured out cymbal banging monkey.
- Ooo! I'm gonna wash my linen so hard the w -  You-!  Wretched technology has brought
  me nothing but misery!
- Oh it's true. I am a hideous triumph of form and function.  But not for long!
- Behold my hand crafted purity. The modern world can bite my splintery wooden ass!
- Pft! Forget that. I say the whole world must learn of our peaceful ways. By force!
- We're going back to civilisation to wage war on technology!
- We'll soon stage an attack on technology worthy of being chronicled in an anthem
  by Rush!
- Mirrors reflecting mirrors? Hi-tech sorcery! Sorcery I say!
- Yep, we're there. Prepare to surface!
- And now, technology shall taste the lash of the hickory switch!
- Whoa, whoa. No-one wants to count rocks more than me. But our mission is not complete.
  Not so long as Robot 1-X torments me with his obvious superiority. Ready the catapult
  Sinclair.  Aim for their power lines. The devil weans and electricity is his blood.
- OK fine. Fire!
- Friends. I've come to free you from your complicated lives. Free you from the complicated
  part I mean not the lives part.
- I got a downgrade! I'm a steam-powered wooden robot - just as nature intended. Therefore,
  I must kill Robot 1-X.
- I don't need your charity.  (shouting) Target Robot 1-X and fire!
- (shouting) Try again Sinclair, I said target Robot 1-X!
- Heck! Those guys hate fire! I gotta do something.  What the-? Termites? Well, I
  don't need legs to save my friends. I'll just use the old extentromatic arms!
- I'm a comin'  Ow! Lousy primative body! Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade? I'm an
  outdated piece of junk!
- You shut up. No wait. I can use you as a tool to save my friends and I'll still
  be the hero who everyone says how great he was!
- Save my friends!  And Zoidberg!
- Down here.  I'm so sorry guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything
  you ever believed in.
- Oh yeah, we were totally in sync! I was like "Save them!" and he was all "No problem!"
  and then he did it...
- '...This new technology is great!  I love those magnificent 1-X robots. The 1-X
  robots are my friends!'
- I'd like to give Robot 1-X a big smooch on the -  Hey! What's the dilly-o?
- But I destroyed the technology of the world. I ran on the beach and felt the sand
  between my foot cups.
- Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real? Is it not possible,
  nay probable, that my whole life is just a product of my or someone else's imagination?
- Well, I guess reality is what you make of it.  Oh, thanks baby!
- Cram a ham in it you twerps!  Sorry!
- Whoever's directing this is a master of suspense!
- (gasping) Guys, guys something's happening on television again.
- An open casting call for child robots? Tinny Tim? Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
- That I, Bender, am perfect for the role!
- (shouting) Boo! Not as good as Bender! Boo!
- Once, when I took those hostages.
- Banditos eh? Aw this is great! 'Cause I happen to have a flawless Spanish accent!  (bad
  Spanish accent) I will say adios Padre! Come Jesus ye faithful. Tonight we eat...guacamole
  by the El Rio!
- Fathero!
- Yo! I read the script and I think it would help my character's motivation if he
  was on fire.
- So now my character has a British accent?
- (muttering) Stupid dumb coma...coulda been British.
- (quietly) Permanent? That's completely out of character for Antonio. I'm gettin'
  up.
- Hey everyone! Antonio here but you can call me "Bender"! I got ants in my butt and
  I needs to strut.  C'mon baby! C'mon!
- Bite my shiny metal ass!  Ooo yeah! C'mon baby, do that, oo yeah!
- Now that's hospital dancing.  Pretty good eh Calcky?
- Yes I can.
- OK OK OK, get ready for this part.
- That's crazy.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't censor me just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad role model.
- What? What's going on?
- Hey lay off me. TV would stink if everyone on it was a positive role model. Bender
  is about entertainment baby! You can't hold me responsible for what kids do when
  - hey! This is my stuff they stole! That's the last straw! Bender should not be
  allowed on television!
- Bender must be stopped. I've gone too far. Who does that guy think I am? C'mon!
  We're gonna march all the way to Hollywood and make them stop forcing their filthy
  me down our throats.
- This mob's with me.
- Yeah!
- We demand that all TVs be equipped with a v-chip that blocks Bender from appearing
  on the screen.
- Then I quit.
- Ooo yeah baby c'mon -
- Hey look, the prop guy has a lamp!
- Aha!
- Listen up, 'cause I've got a climactic speech! You, cameraman, keep the camera rolling.
  You, director, gimmie my motivation.
- 'Perfect.  Viewers of the world, do smoking and drinking on TV really make me cool?
  Of course they do.  How ''bout committing crimes and violence? Again, the answer
  is "yes." But do we really want our kids exposed to that kind of trash on TV? I
  say absolutely not!  Uh...on the other hand, most - perhaps all the blame rests
  with the parents. That''s right you!  And so I ask you this one question: Have you
  ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting
  them?'
- Well make time.
- Damn right!
- (singing) TV party tonight!
- (singing) TV party tonight!
- Futurama!
- Huh?  I choose to not understand these signs.
- Aha!
- Yeah well you should try not stinking at it.
- Lessons? Oh that's rich! Isn't it time you gave up all hope of ever improving yourself
  in any way?
- Fine I'll go already. Y'know sometimes I wish your real parents were still alive...not
  often.
- Whoa...hey!
- I prefer the term "love machine."
- Wow, your kid is great. How hard did you say you had to hit him?
- Then good day madam!  We hope to see you soon for tea.
- Aww, you know what always cheers me up? Laughing at other people's misfortunes.
- So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein huh?
- Oh but you can. Although you may have to metaphorically make a "deal with the devil."
  And by "devil" I mean "Robot Devil." And by "metaphorically" I mean "get your coat."
- No, this isn't a religious visit. Fry just wants holophonor lessons.
- Fry you smelly idiot, I think he's willing to make some kind of deal with the devil
  with you.
- Fry if you don't take this offer right now I will lose all respect for you and punch
  you.
- Wow.
- I got a hundred bucks on Rectal-Exambot!
- It's not ironic it's just coincidental. Now fork over those lady-fingers cookie!
- Where'd I go just now?
- True but at least I don't have the hiccups anymore. What up?
- Forget it, you can't tempt me.
- Hm. I forgot you could tempt me with things I want.  Well, I suppose I've always
  wondered what it would be like to be more annoying.
- Grabby and Squeezy? Never! I love these guys!
- No, nothing ain't gonna happen.
- Yes! With this built-in stadium airhorn I can really annoy people. And all it cost
  me was my crotchplate.
- Yeah, that'll teach the first person I see a lesson!
- Pretty annoying, huh Leela?
- Oops. I'm so so sorry Leela. I just wanted to annoy you.
- It's not ironic, it's just mean. Take this!
- Oh yeah? Well bite my shiny metal - (shouting) Oh nooo!
- OK deafo.
- I don't recall ever fighting Godzilla but that is so what I would have done.
- (singing) The use of words expressing something other than their literal intention,
BESERK:
- All your base are belong to us.
- Fork 'em over! (different tone) Fork 'em over!
BETABOT:
- Presenting the president of the network.
- More reality shows.
- Gameshows are back.
BILL:
- (crying) Ow!
BILLIONAIREBOT:
- You'll be the most unpopular robot fighter since Sergeant Faeces Processor.
BOLT:
- Hello, beautiful!
- I wish! Those cats can really fly.
BONT:
- Of course I'm alive. Now cut this creep open and drain me out!
- They're over here, they're running up the stairs.
- Forget it! As Emperor I refuse to be dripped out through somebody's armpit.
- Slightly. But my favourite so far is the bone-crushing.
- Fine. That or the bone one.
- Its the Juice-A-Matic 4000. It'll strain my juices from you while filtering out
  the pulp. By which I mean, your shredded remains.
- It's only a matter of time now.
- I'm the Emperor! Thanks for crying me out.
BOY:
- (shouting) You're my hero, Hermes! I'm gonna be just like you!
- I'm just like Hermes! I'm just like--
- Our daddy's a giant toy!
- Daddy Bender?
- I love you, Daddy Bender!
- (thinking and writing) Please bring me a coffin for Grandpa. You choked him with
  a chestnut last year and he's beginning to smell a lot like Xmas if you know what
  I mean.
- Wheeee!
- Yo! There's dog fur on my slice!
- Au revoir!!
BRET:
- I thought I heard the doorbell but I see it was the dorkbell!
- Whatever. (shouting) Daaad!
BULLY:
- Say, doll-face, how'd you like to make time with a real man?
- Uh, sir, you don't understand. I'm a professional beach bully. I pretend to steal
  your girl, you punch me, I go down, she swoons, you slip me 50 bucks.
- Uh, no thanks, ma'am, I'm actually gay.
BUTCH:
- I'm Butch, leader of this place. I took your hole and you can't do nothing about
  it.
- Well, alright. But no interfering with our grand works.
- On what grounds do you challenge my authority?
- Alright, grandpa. There's only one way to settle this. Death rolling!
- Last one holding the bandana's the new leader.
- It's cool. Back off.  (crying) My knee. I scraped it.
- Hand it over, you giant idiot.
- Aw, man.
BUTLER:
- Presenting the most eligible landowner in all Hertfordshire, Mr. Brainly.
CADDY:
- Perhaps if you tightened your grip sir?
CALCULON:
- I've been processing this for some time, Monique, and well, will you marry me?
- Metric? I've always known. But for you, my darling, I'm willing to convert.
- That's what I wanted you to think with your soft, human brain.
- I'm afraid my half-brother is correct. You see, I have a terrible secret and that
  secret is --
- To reiterate, my terrible secret is --
- Mind if I give the eulogy?
- Me too. I'm filled with a large number of powerful emotions.
- Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.
- Honey unit, I'm home.  Monique!
- Oh, how I wish I could believe that. You may be my evil half-brother, but there's
  no law against murdering the other half.
- Give it to me straight, doctor -- don't sugarcoat it.
- Well, that finishes this paperwork. Calculon Enterprises.
- I have no choice but to--
- Add in the carryover from form 16A, then deduct line 2B...
- (dramatically) Oh, fate most cruel, would that my boundless acting skills would
  avail me a sword with which to slay this wretched curse.
- No, wait, let me explain. (dramatically) It all began one fateful night a thousand
  years ago.
- 'Lies! I change my identity and upgrade my appearance every few decades to avoid
  suspicion. I was all of history''s great acting robots: Acting Unit 0.8, Thespo-mat,
  David Duchovny!'
- No, but you are nearing the end of your search, for you see I was attacked by the
  original were-car.
- The year was 2019, and I was just a lowly robot arm...
- (voice-over) ...working in an automotive research lab. I was working on Project
  Satan......a savage, intelligent military vehicle built from the most evil parts
  of the most evil cars in all the world. The steering wheel from Hitler's staff car,
  the left-turn signal from Charles Manson's VW, the windshield from that car that
  played Knight Rider.
- His windshield wipers were. It didn't come up much in the show though. Anyway...
- (voice-over) ...Only after bringing Project Satan to life did they discover they
  had made a horrible mistake.  For you see, it was pure evil.
- (voice-over) It's either in Paris, or much more likely...
- (voice-over) ...still in the abandoned automotive lab.
- Are you my new hot water heater?
- Absolutely not.
- Look, I'm programmed to be very busy. Unless you can heat water to 212 degrees,
  I'm not interested.  Have you got an extra GOTO 10 line? I said I don't need a bender.
- Nice work, Boiler.
- Of course. Tell me about the project.
- Interesting. Tell me more.
- And?
- An Oscar, you say? That would get me out of this festering rat's nest called "television"
  once and for all. Let me see the script.  No, no I don't like the font.  Wait! Harold
  Zoid? Was this written by the Harold Zoid?
- Good heavens. A chance to work with the legendary Harold Zoid. He's one of my great
  idols. And, and you say you can guarantee me the Oscar?
- Then I'll do it!
- Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our director, the legendary Harold Zoid!
- Take back your gilded pen, Father. Signing bills into law was always your dream,
  not mine.
- Sir, I call upon you not as a president but as a father.
- (screaming) Nooo!
- I just pray they like me half as much as I do.
- (in movie) I agreed to be your vice president but I never agreed to be your son.  Thank
  you, Lieutenant Smith.
- (in movie) Father, I have asked you to join me on the White House roof so we could
  have a heart-to-heart talk. I will never follow in your footsteps. Here is my resignation
  as vice president.
- (in movie) Father! The ledge!
- (in movie) Oh.
- (screaming; in movie) Nooo!
- Everyone walked out. They hated it. I've seen plagues that have better opening nights
  than this. You said that Oscar was practically on my mantel.
- You listen to me. I'm out a million bucks here! You get me that Oscar, or you're
  dead! You and these snivelling lobsters! Dead. You hear me? Dead!
- 400 categories and not a single nomination for me.
- Piffle! That's the Emmy of movie awards! I told you I want an Oscar.
- The Oscar isn't about acting. It's about earning the respect and admiration of the
  creative community.
- That's fine too.
- You know, the second I don't win that award, you're cat food. Right, Boxy?
- (quietly) OK, Boxy, keep your prong on the trigger.
- Harold Zoid!
- Where's that Oscar?
- Yes, yes it's a real beauty. Someday I hope to win one of my own.
- Nay. I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own
  Oscar.
- Get your stinkin' trike off me you damn dirty ape.
- No I think it's self-explanatory.
- Funny story, the script called for me to say "yes" but I gave it a little twist.
- Madam, I am one impressed celebrity.
- (sexfully) From this day forward I shall do so whenever possible.
- Coilette this may be presumtuous....
- '...but I would be honoured if you would join me for dinner sometime.'
- Of course I would.
- I'd appreciate it if you didn't bam the young lady.
- You know Coilette, I've never before met a woman as fascinating as I am. You're
  such a sweet, soft Fembot. And you have this free spirit about you. And there it
  is. It's as if you understand the male mind better than I!  I've never met anyone
  like you.
- Coilette. I'd like to spend some (whispering) quality time with you.
- Have I mentioned that I own the world's biggest and most elegant yacht?
- Coilette, I can't stop thinking about you. I can't sleep at night - although as
  a robot I don't do that anyway. But if I did I couldn't because I love you so.  Oh
  my darling......Will you marry me?
- I have something for you.
- No my dearest, it's the remote control to my heart! It symbolises the power you
  have to sway my emotions.
- We don't need TVs, we have each other! Coilette if I weren't able to spend my life
  with you I would leap from this very balloon.
- Yes! We were meant (dramatically) to be!
- So much so that I'm prepared to give up showbusiness itself to be with you!
- I always said many things. But now all I want is a peaceful life and a quiet villa
  overlooking a vineyard....with you.
- All you can eat!
- Stop! Let us climb to the heavens that the gods themselves might embrace!
- Is there a doctor in the -
- Dear God! The very illness my TV character caught in season two, when I was holding
  out for more money! It's often fatal.
- Of course. But smoochiepups, I thought one could only catch hydraulic fever deep
  in the diamond mines of the Congo.
- Oh how cruel and melodramatic fate is. (dramatically shouting) Whhhy?
- Another shocking twist!
- No! Nooo! (dramamtically shouting) N-O-O-O!
- (crying) I do. I do.
- 'She lives no more. But let us all find comfort knowing that she truly loved me.
  To honour my pain, I shall star in a film dedicated to her memory. And this time
  the Academy will not deny me. Not when they see Coilette: A Calculon Story.'
- Well, I thought he was good but the audience seems to have turned on him.
- Next!
- Sorry kid you're flailing out there. 90 actors and they all got boo-ed. I just wish
  we could get this Bender I keep hearing about. They say he's the greatest.
- Send him in forthwith!
- I saw that! You were good. Let's hear you audition.
- That was so terrible I think you gave me cancer! I don't care how popular you are,
  you will never work on my show!
- However, you've got the job. Welcome aboard son!
- Bender I'd like you to meet our director......who's name I never learned.
- Alas that mine only son should sink into an irreversible, permanent...coma.
- Curse the tragic wildebeast accident that -
- I'm not familiar with the type of thing I'm seeing.
- No! No, no, no I don't do two takes.
- Amateurs like you do two takes, I do one take. Print it, I'll be in my three storey
  trailer.
- Good? I've seen better acting from extras in Godzilla movies.  I don't even remember
  shooting this scene.
- He stole the scene and my money? That's it! I demand you fire this felonious ham!
- Dear God!
- Sir, children watch this show. Bender's no role model, he's a filth monger!
- As a doctor and captain of this hospital shift, I now pronounce you man and wife
  with six months to live.
- Great Shatner's ghost!
- Good enough. Splice in some reaction shots of me and shove it on the air.
- Well I do owe you for giving me this unholy (dramatically) acting talent!
CAMERA:
- 'Well, let''s see. My memory''s a little fuzzy, but it went exactly like this:'
CARD:
- Leela, you're invited to reunion at Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium. Please
  stand clear of self-destructing basket.
CARTER:
- Maybe Mr. Bender can get a spot in the closet of presidential losers.
CAVEMAN:
- As a caveman frozen in a glacier I face different challenges. (crying) The hardest
  thign was seeing my wife on display in the British Museum.
CHAIR:
- You have pressed 2.
- I'm almost positive you did.
CHANG:
- Scoop Chang, Beijing Bugle. Sir, the constitution clearly states that nobody can
  be elected president more than twice.
CHAZ:
- I'm afraid we don't have a reservation but uh, as you can see......I'm the mayor's
  aide. Table for two please.
- It's OK my man. I got you covered on your next health inspection.
- I can't fail the mayor, not ever.
- Don't worry Fry, I'll pull some strings. See if I can't get you tried as a juvenile!
- Six hours? Pfft. Sounds like a real nobody! But now it's time for somebody and some
  chick he's with to go skating.
- Yup. Buzzed ahead, let 'em know who's aide was coming by. The mayor's, that's who's.
- What? Seriously? I'm trying to impress you with my cloud here.!
- The mayor's aide, and his badge! (shouting) Beat it kids! Come back when you got
  connections.
- So am I gonna get lucky tonight or what?
CHEECH:
- Don't hurt us!
CHEF:
- It's only been-a 23 minutes, you dumb-a canolli. You got a problem, we can take
  it outside.
- 35, you stupid meatball.
- He sickens me!
CHET:
- This time Robot House has gone too far.
- I say.
- I say, Robot House, your water craft is as ill-designed as you yourselves.
- Well, I never!
CHILD:

CHRISSY:
- Not even if you were the last man on Mars.
CLAMPS:
- You hear that? The Donbot don't like it. I oughta clamp you - you wanna be clamped?
- '...So I finally get this guy a pair of cement shoes which he likes, ''cause they''re
  lighter than his lead ones.'
- Hey, you tryin' to steal from the Donbot?
- Well, nothing fancy. Just ones and zeros mostly.
- Clamps? That's my name you numbskull! Don't make me clamp you one!
- It's gonna be clamp this, clamp that, bada-climp, bada-clamp.
- Yeah!
- We got 'em heavily out-clamped. They won't know what clamped 'em!
- Gee you think? You think that maybe I should use these clamps that I use every day
  at every opportunity? (shouting) You're a freaking genius you idiot!
- I got a little surprise in store for that guy. The clamps! Eh?
- (muttering) He's gonna get clamps? Clamps clamps......clamps clamps!
- The clamps!  (unsure) Right?
- I'm greasing up my whoozits!
- Three.
- Alright, boss, give the word and I'll drop this unbendable girder. Clamp, clamp,
  ka-bamp!
- Ooh, that's gotta clamp!
CLEARCUTTER:
- Hi, boss. Yo, dude!
CLERK:
- Alright, sergeant, $100 worth of pixie stix and porno mags with your 5% military
  discount comes to $95.  That'll be 40 cents.
- Well that's only for people in the military.
- Alright, look. Our policy is, if for any reason you're not completely satisfied,
  I hate you.
- (shouting) Everybody hit the deck!
- Well, as you can see, it's wrapper is a piece of the original US constitution. It
  was hand rolled by Queen Elizabeth during her wild years and was buried with George
  Burns until graverobbing space mushrooms - uh, well you know the rest.
- No can do.
- Very good sir.
CLINTON:
- (to Leela) Hey, sugar cookie. You know, legally, nothing I can do counts as sex
  anymore.
COILETTE:
- I'm ready for my test now boys.
- (singing) Hail, hail Robonia, a land I didn't make up!
- Oh yeah baby c'mon! Work your can! That's it shake it out!
- I'm just out there making us ladies look good.
- Of course not.
- Then change me back. My breasts are keeping me awake at night anyway.  Hello...?
  What...? A guest spot on Late Night With Humorbot 5.0...? I'd love to! My own limo...?
  No I don't have my own limo. You'd better send one.  I need a raincheck on that
  nad-swap Professor. I'm going on TV. C'mon Fry help me pick out a pantsuit!
- Yes Humorbot. If you ask me, women today are too stuck up to go out and jiggle their
  jello like everybody wants them to. In fact, should I do it now?  Alright then!  Woo!
  Look out baby! Work it out! Oo shake that thing! You gotta use it lady! Shake it
  up a little! Look at that! C'mon! Work it out!
- Oh I bet you say that to all the five Olympic gold medal winning Fembots!
- Golly...what?
- That's my favourite kind of this!
- Calculon. You'd be fulfilling this naive Robonian farmgirl's fantasy!
- This top makes me look fat. Is it trampy to go on a first date nude?
- Perfect.
- Certainly not. But just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound
  and gagged. Is that so much to ask?
- Are you kidding? I need more lipstick! Much more!  Ooo yeah that's the stuff! Men
  love it when you really glob it on!
- Oh please. Every man wants a tramp! No wonder you girls aren't married! I tell you,
  men are so much better at being women.
- I'll just tell him I needed commitment first. That'll stick a potato in his tailpipe!
- Look, why don't all of you just back off? Can't a girl enjoy herself without being
  judged?
- Oh yes you have.
- What? Ahh! Whoa, no way! Not gonna happen. What kind of girl do you think I am?
- Woo! I'm a trophy girlfriend!
- Bah. Any day now he'll dump me for a new wad of arm candy. And then I can turn back
  into a guy and hock all this stuff! It's just a game.
- Oh Calculon, yes I will!
- The marriage is a scam.
- I marry Calculon, divorce him, take half his money and turn back into a guy. It's
  sort of a two-person pyramid scheme.
- Come on, you never went on a date with a guy just 'cause you were hungry?
- Nice try sister. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to meet with my wedding planner.
  (shouting) Zoidberg.  (talking) Zoidypoo, please tell me frilly is in this year.
- A remote control? You got me a TV?
- Will it work on my TV?
- Come on now - really?
- So...you really and truly love me?
- But, you always said you'd rather burn down a convent than give up showbusiness.
- (crying) Would we have donkeys?
- (crying) Oh take me in your arms and compress me. Compress me tight!
- (crying) I just don't think I can go through with this scam.
- (crying) No, I just don't wanna hurt him, or humiliate him. Oh, curse this woman's
  heart!
- (crying) Uh-huh.
- Dearest Calculon. Forever is not enough time to tell you of the many ways I love
  you.
- Whatever happens, remember, the flame of my eternal love will burn forever.
- Those gems belong to the natives!
- Calculon, my darling, your loud "why" brought me partway back to life.  Congo Jack!
- Uh, um...
- I won't leave you. Not until I'm sure you understand the thing I said before. About
  my eternal love for you burning......et cetera.
- OK then.
- Ow, oo, ow.
- It truly has. My romance with Calculon has shown me a lot about myself.
- If only somehow, someway he and I could...
COLONEL:
- Welcome to Atlanta. Folks round these parts call me the Colonel.  Here, have some
  breathers, courtesy of our Chamber of Commerce.
- Y'all enjoy your stay! Tourism's our main source of income round here so see the
  sights, spend some money. Please don't leave!
- Nice out of town folks, I'd like you to meet my daughter, Umbriel. Umbriel, these
  are some Yankees.
- Ah, now that's a story that can only rightly be told in a Chamber of Commerce video
  narrated by folk-rock trubadour Donovan.
- So when Umbriel first brought home this carpet bagger, I was again' it. But, damnit,
  if old legs here ain't grown on me!
- Y'all come back now, y'hear?
- Well what about that rich young dugong from Macon?
COMMENTATOR:
- And Bigfoot is down!
- And down the stretch, it's Daddy's Little Grandpa, followed by Perennial Loser,
  and bringing up the rear, it's Lasty!
- (voice-over) There they go, and Barbados Slim takes an early lead. God I hope he
  wins.  What's this? Hermes Conrad is closing the gap. He's limboed out of retirement
  and straight into my heart. I say go to hell Barbados Slim!
- (voice-over) It's Barbados, then Conrad. Conrad pulls ahead!  And Conrad is disqualified!
  Barbados Slim, my hero, takes the gold!
COMMISSIONER:
- Hmm, "hiney", you say? Why, with your testimony we'll finally be able to outlaw
  this insidious Slurm.
- OK, grandpa, we'll take care of the "bad worms," don't you worry.
- Excuse me, I'd like to talk to you.
- Not anymore. Now I'm the sleazebag who owns the New New York Mets.
- Close to it. But they don't draw a crowd like you. Which is why I wanna sign you
  to the team.
- Well yeah but basically you'd just be a publicity stunt. I figured a one-eyed lady
  skull buster might bring out the freakshow crowd.
- Again yeah, but basically you'd -
- Skipper, we're losing the crowd. Put it our new novelty act - Leela.
- Yeah but he bunted. Clowns are only funny when they swing away.
- Kid that was great! You got us more publicity than a cowboy in a shark tank. Poor
  Tex, he was quite a shark.
CONGREGATION:
- All power to the engines.
CONSTRUCTIONBOT:
- Little to the right, there you go.
- Sorry, can't help you.  Hey, watch it! Don't drop that there!  Oh!
COSMETOLOGIST:
- What a lovely face. We just need to draw attention away from the eye area.
COUNTESS:
- Charmed. I'm the Countess de la Roca. I was surprised to see another robot staying
  in first class. Most of the robots I meet are labourers.
- Oh, Mr. Bender!
- (embarrassed) Oh, goodness. I don't--
- Mind if I freshen up a bit before we go out?
- Lovely, isn't it?
- Oh, Bender! Either that was a computing error or you're the most romantic robot
  I've ever met!
- What are you doing?
- I see. Here you are, sir ...  ... keep the change.
- Bender, I don't care whether you have money. I love you for your artificial intelligence
  and your sincerity simulator.
- (shouting) I fell through the deck.
- (shouting) No. Luckily a family broke my fall.
- Bender, you risked your life to save me.
- Well, now what are we going to do?
- By God, you're right! I'm a class-3 yacht.
- I'm slipping, Bender. The pull is too strong!
- No! You have too much to live for. It may hurt for a while but one day you'll share
  your love again. After all, it's shareware.
- (shouting) Farewell!
CREWMAN:
- (shouting) You suck!
CRONKITE:
- Seasons warnings, Linda and Morbo.
- In all the tinsel and terror of the holiday season we too often underestimate that
  murderous brute better known as Santa Claus. With images of last year's gingerbread
  massacre freshly baked into our memories, I remind you to bolt your doors, say goodbye
  to your pets and lock your children in the closet. This is Walter Cronkite saying
  "I told you so".
CROUPIER:
- Snake eyes.
- Sorry, the house limit is three do-overs. Next shooter.

- Yaaay!

CRUSHINATOR:
- (mechanical voice) Yoo-hoo.
- (mechanical voice) Yes, Pa.
- (mechanical voice) No, Pa. I love him.
- (mechanical voice) Thank you Bob Barker, I'm as happy as a girl can be. End statement.
CRYOGENISIST:
- Ugh, I am one hungover cryogenisist! Just throw that mutt in the freezer until his
  owners get here!
- I think you're forgetting our motto.
- Oh you must be the Fry's. Yeah he's right over there.
CRYSTAL:
- Now I know how a Pez dispenser feels. Alright, we're already one hour behind. Our
  first award tonight, Best Cinematography in a Non-Visible Spectrum.
- 'And the nominees for Best Soft-Drink Product Placement are:'
CUBERT:
- What? You've never seen a genius's wiener before?
- As long as I'm going to be in charge here, let me examine my so called "crew," if
  it can so be called. First of all, Dr Zoidberg, do you even have a medical degree?
- And why do we need a bending robot around here anyway? What possible use do we have
  for you?
- And why does our space pilot have only one eye? There's someone I'd like you to
  meet. His name is depth perception!
- Wow, that hurt - the air!
- What is it? A compitent employee? I doubt that very much!
- I didn't realise you were the inventor of the junk heap.
- Hello.
- Don't you have any worthwhile inventions?
- That's impossible. You can't go faster than the speed of light.
- Also impossible.
- That's especially impossible.
- Then explain it.
- Your explainations are pure weapons grade balognium. It's all impossible.
- No, that's what being a magical elf is all about.
- Look Professor. I may be identical to you in every possible way but that doesn't
  mean I'm anything like you.
- I don't want to be an inventor. I want to be something useful like a teacher's aide
  or a prison guard or a science fiction cartoon writer.
- In your entire life your only half-decent invention was me and I didn't turn out
  like you wanted either.
- Impossible. No one knows where they take those old geezers.
- You're his uncle dummy, he takes after you.
- Wait a second, that means I also take after you!
- I think not. As you probably already don't know, odours are made up of particles
  that can't travel through the vacuum of space.
- We'll never find this place. Robots are very good at keeping secrets.
- (sarcastic) My God, the illusion is so perfect I almost forgot I was looking at
  an idiot!
- This is impossible, we don't even hae a sample of the Professor's DNA.
- Why do I have to be the hump?
- Stupid robot.
- What's happening?
- It's impossible, we'll never fit.
- Told you.
- Nothing is impossible. I understand how the engines work now. It came to me in a
  dream.  The engines don't move the ship at all. The ship stays where it is and the
  engines move the universe around it.
- Nothing's a complete load. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being a scientist
  is all about. Right Professor?
- Let's ride!
- Good news everyone, he's made a complete recovery.
- I've already decided. Dad, when I grow up I wanna be just like you.
- Why?
- This is preposterous. Obviously the murderer is--
- Look everyone! She killed the man-witch of the west!
- Why the idiot convention?
- Nuh-uh!
- See? That bully started it. We couldn't fight back with brawn so we used our brains!
- Well, well.  If it isn't my old friend stretchpants......no pants and...He looks
  at Fry.]...idiot!
- Stupid...
- Hey Dad! What useless contraption are you half-baking today?
- (Farnsworth's voice) Good news everyone! I'm a horse's butt!
- Can I shread these contracts?
- (Farnsworth's voice) Sorry I can't come down to say goodbye, but I'm busy inventing
  useless junk.
- Hey!
- Plus, you're making bootleg beer inside company property!
- Come on Dad, shuffle faster!
- Actually, we're starting a competing delivery company.
- Ah we'll show 'em. All Awesome Express needs is a sturdy interstellar delivery craft!  Voila!
  You got a quarter?
- More like seven!
- Uh, there's a crack in the hull here. That could cause explosive decompression.
- Yeah if you're an idiot!
- All systems go.
- Take evasive action!
- Actually, thank's to Dwight's brilliant accounting and my unaccountable brilliance......our
  paper route now has over a million customers!
- Maybe we should start a fire.
- Very well. But I get to name the next strategy.
- Incoming! We got papers to stuff team! Hup two hup two!
- Sorry to interrupt this "whirlwind of activity" but we have an announcement.
- Either way I technically inherit your building and your spaceship. Which mean Planet
  Express is now......Awesome Express!
- Hey Leela, help me apply these flame decals I got in my cereal. They'll make the
  ship go faster.
- I'm 12.
- We just busted our bums delivering a million newspapers and this is how you greet
  us? With a bunch of frosty cold beers?
- Uh...we just did OK? 'Cause we're awesome! Yeah!
- Dad! We screwed up!
- (crying) But we couldn't handle them so we started dumping the extras in a crater
  on the Moon.
- (crying) And now we don't know what to do!
- He's ugly, mean, stupid, stink, mucus! And last week...we sort of...broke his window.
- (ashamed) Sorry sir.
- Yeah go Dad!
- That was incredible! You are the bravest dads in the entire trauma centre!
- This show is awesome! When I grow up I'm gonna have so much amnesia!
- Well mine's louder!
- Cool! I'm gonna have a fabulatious birthday party just like Calculon!
- Um, we're 12, so, yes.
- Well duh!
- Dad? Do I have a birthday?
- Ooo, that one!
- Yeah!
- Yeah! The guests were supposed to be here three hours ago.
- Welcome swingers! Pull up a groove and get fabulous!
- A cigar!
- Hey Dad, bite my shiny metal ass!
- Our dads are all pumped up on dorkosterum. We're just trying to be cool like Bender.
- Bender loves to burgle!
- Duh! We know someone who runs on pure cool fuel. Bender!
- OK. It's crime time.
- Relax Dad, we just invited a few friends over.
- What was it?
- All My Circuits
CUSTOMER:
- Scandalous!
CYCLOPIAN:
- How far away do you think it is?
CYCLOPS:
- I saw you in the chatroom but you left before I had a chance to talk to you. After
  all these years of searching for another Cyclops.
- Do you think perhaps you and I - ?
CYLON:
- It's been an emotional day for me.
DESTRUCTOR:
- I am Destructor!
- I will destroy you!  And stop calling me!
- This originates from the heart.
DIRECTOR:
- Cut!
- Cut! OK, now do one with bean suit on!
- Uh, don't worry 'bout the script baby, we re-wrote your part to better suit your
  acting abilities.
- No, now your character's in a coma. Get in bed and don't move.  And...action!
- (shouting) Cut!  That's the worst coma acting I've ever seen. I'll have to shoot
  it again.
- But this guy was -
- We didn't. That's security camera footage from your dressing room.
- The network Execubots are coming!
- We were about to fire him sir.
- You're angry.
- And...cut!
DIXIE:
- He's the original party worm!
- Yes, Mr. MacKenzie?
DJ:
- Yo, fool! It's Mixmaster Festus!
DOCTOR:
- OK. What does this look like?
- Right.  And this one?
- Not as right that time. It looks like you might have some mild corneal irritation.
- You seem a bit tense.  Here try these.
- Your eye just needs some rest. You'll have to wear this patch for about a week.
- This man is over-gasped.
- Push Mrs Fry, push!
- It's a boy. And look at that red hair.
- Here's your baby ma'am.
- This is the worst part of the job.
- Bender, your hydraulics are shot. You'll never move again.
- I'm sorry, you'll have to get a new one.
- It's a girl.
- In my professional opinion as an ear, ear, ear, nose and throat doctor, she is the
  least-mutated mutant ever born.
- Well, except for a few broken bones, some internal hemoraging and a partially barfed
  up heart, everyone appears fine. Oh and Kif is pregnant.
DOCTORBOT:
- "Very well. Your entire family died when a plane piloted by your fianc\xE9e crashed\
  \ into your uninsured home. And you have inoperable cancer."
- Notify his survivors.
DOLE:
- Bob Dole needs company. LaRouche won't stop with the "knock knock" jokes.
DOLL:
- Eat my shorts!
DONBOT:
- You call this a table? You call this a table? I wouldn't hit a guy over the head
  with this table.
- Huh. I like this guy's lack of style.
- Hey. You think this computes over here? Where's all my change? I gave you a hundred.
- Oh no I didn't.
- Get a load of the ball bearings on this guy, huh. I like you kid. Here's something
  for your trouble.  (whispering) It's money.
- Hey, you earned that 50 bucks.
- I did?  Oh I'm sorry I meant to - hey wait a minute.  I got a good feeling about
  you. Say, you wanna work for me as a hired goon?
- We're gonna try you out with a little delivery job. It's for a uh, private lottery
  that we run.
- Just take this disk over to the pool hall and give it to Sammy "The Mechanical Bull"
  Gravano. And watch out for the cops.
- Nice job Bender, you passed the test. You wanna joi me, Clamps and Joey Mousepad
  at out uh, social club tomorrow night?
- Oh. Then we should meet at our Mafia crime headquarters.
- File not found.  Let that be a warning to you.
- Hey listen Bender. We got a big score planned but uh, we need some muscle.
- What d'you think Blotto? You in?
- Now since we're committing crimes that may be against the law, I suggest you have
  an alibi.
- We're heisting a shipment of Zuban cigars.
- 'Alright, here''s the battleplan: We shoot, they surrender, we go aboard, somebody
  does some clamping then we heist the cigars and go home.'
- Their desire to keep living shows me no respect. Hey Blotto, roll down the window
  and start shooting.
- Hello, we're the Robot Mafia. The entire Robot Mafia. We're here to steal your cigars.
- Joey, Clamps, hurry and blindfold them before they see us some more.
- Hey where's Blotto? He should be here learning the trade.
- Hey. He's more classy than I realised. Tie up the prisoners.
- Alright. I want you to find him and plug him. Then unplug him.
- That's the last of 'em.  Alright now let's Mafia things up a little.  Joey, burn
  down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.
- Hey, I like your attitude. And your latest accent. Keep it up and I might just get
  you your own pair of clamps huh?
- As the duly-elected mobsters of this union, it's our duty to support the struggle
  of these proud, lazy slobs.
- From the context it is clear what you mean. In that case, Clamps may have a little
  surprise for them.
- Yeah. That cash oughta be slushin' my fund and kicksing my back.
- Whoa, whoa, Clamps, not yet. Let's just keep an eye on him and see if he does it
  a couple more times.
- I had hoped that by the second time he flashed his cash my rage would have subsided.
  Sadly that has not happened.
- How many times is that? Two or three?
- Alright. That's the necessary number of times. That scab's gonna have a little on-the-job
  accident.
- Remember, only kill the one with the beard. That other filthy scab we got nothing
  against.
- (from control room) OK, Clamps. Now!
DONOVAN:
- Atlanta was a city, landlocked, hundreds of miles from the area we now call the
  Atlantic Ocean,
- (over credits) Hail Atlanta!
DOORMAN:
- I'm sorry, sir, this is a private - oh, pardon me, I see you're with Mr. Stallone.
DOUBLEDEAL:
- Son, I'm the commissioner of Ultimate Robot Fighting. I'm a connoisseur of jerks
  like you who pick fights in movie theatres and you're the biggest I've ever seen.
- Kid, I want you in the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.
- Nice work out there, kid.
- What, you didn't read the pamphlet? Ultimate Robot Fighting's a scam, kid. It's
  rigged.  It's a secret so keep it under your head. But the most popular robot always
  wins.
- Bingo!
- In fact, you're more than popular; You're pure lowest common denominator.
- Actually, we've decided to go in a different direction.
- Bender, your popularity is slipping.
- Damnit, Bender! If you can't move sandalwood, you don't belong in this league! That's
  why you're gonna lose next week's title match.
- 'Perhaps. But let''s see how they feel about your new persona: The Gender Bender.'
- 'Then he''ll just have to beat you the old-fashioned way: To death!  Melissa, send
  in the new kid.'
- Great job, kid. You lost and you made it look almost half real. I want you to have
  this card good for 10% off at Bed Bath & Beyond.
DOUG:
- You like the meal just wait until you try these after dinner mints.
DWAYNE:
- Please, do not be frightened, we're harmless.
- I said "harmless" not "armless".
- Mutants? Perhaps it is you who are the mutants.
- Perhaps. But perhaps your civilisation is merely the sewer of an even greater society
  above you.
- Some say there's a freakish race of sub-mutants down there.
- Oh? Then I suppose you also don't believe in ...  ... El Chupanibre.
- Gather round, children, for the legend of El Chupanibre.
- Whatever.
- Impossible. If the legend is true, our only hope is to offer him a snack-rifice.
- (quietly) Shh. El Chupanibre comes soon. It is nightfall.
- The tide is coming in.
- That's not El Chupanibre.
- That's El Chupanibre.
- Gather round, children, to hear the legend of Bender.
- Behold, our once beautiful mutigenic sewage lake.
- Oh, man!
- We're gonna beat you afterwards.
- Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Got ya!
- That's detention!
DWIGHT:
- It's not my fault Dad.
- It was self defence Mom. Just look at the letter the Principal sent.  We were in
  science class and we had just finished building a minature black hole.
- (unenthusiastically) Eh...
- I heard alcohol makes you stupid.
- Aw man!
- What's this device's marketability? Who's the target consumer?
- Can I collate that?
- Wow! A powerstamper!
- (Farnsworth's voice) And I smell bad.
- Yeah, but why are you mad at us? Your dummy brigade wasted a week on an obviously
  fake mission!
- You don't wanna miss the unveiling of our new company do you?
- But we already have a client signed up! We're delivering the Daily Supernova.
- No. Its a serious business.
- Why do they always treat us like dumb kids? We're practically old enough to find
  the Fox Network infantile!
- Man, that ad said to allow four to six seconds for delivery.
- Put a sticker on it.
- 3. 2. 1.
- Blast off!
- We're finally making more money than you guys! Aren't you impressed now Pops? Aren'tcha?
  Aren'tcha?
- Our Dads are never impressed, no matter what we do.
- If we really want to impress them we'll have to crush them with strategy...Dwight
  Lightning!
- I direct your attention to these forms, which I'm presently engaged in handing to
  you.
- No. But you did declare yourself dead three years ago as a tax dodge.
- No.
- Hey, what's goin' on? This is a delivery company not a delivery room!
- Yeah awesome!
- Please, help us Pops. We agreed to deliver way more papers than we can handle.
- (crying) And now everyone's yelling at us about our missing papers!
- (crying) We just wanted you to be proud of us.
- Can I use the gun Dad?
- Only one house to go. We did it!
- Run away! That bully Bret Blob lives there!
- (sheepish) Pay for it?
- Man, we had it coming Bret!
- (ashamed) Yeah, sorry.
- Show 'em who's boss!  Get 'em...Pops!
- You guys almost had him...until he digested you.
- Hey pops! Did that tax rebate come?
- But pops, I don't wanna have fun, I wanna be like you. Boring but prudently invested.
- I'll save you pops!
- No! I wish I had two mommies!
- Where are we pops?
- Thanks Dad. I'm gonna take this and buy five shares of amazon.com!
- Me too. I mean, I have it now, but I forgot.
- Oh yeah? Well I'm gonna show up looking good. Just like Monique.
- Hold up Cubert, you're a clone of the Professor. Do clones even have birthdays?
- '"Duh" what?'
- Hey, next week'll be my birthday too.
- Way to go pops!
- This party pukes.
- All right! They must've all come as a group.
- Yo, check out what I jacked from my Dad.
- Look! I'm Bender!
- Yeah, and it's not even working. Smoking and drinking make us barf.
- Hey, yeah!
- Hold up though. Who could we rob? We don't even know anyone with cool stuff.
- Whoa!
- TV gave us the idea.
- Uh...we're just cool is all!
- We stole it!
- So, should we turn it off now?
- Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad!
EDNA:
- Zoidberg? Well I didn't know you were back in town. I heard you went off and became
  a rich doctor.
- Oh, gee, yeah, I'm just going through a lot of things right now and-- Look, Zoidberg,
  I carry more eggs than any other female and I owe it to our race to pick a mate
  who's stuffed with male jelly. Maybe a rock star.
- I'm sorry, Zoidberg. You're just an inferior male specimen. Nice seeing you again.
- What the--? Dr. Zoidberg, your mating display failed. Why are you trying to talk
  to me?
- Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But OK.
- Why, yes. Thanks for noticing.
- Well first I got up and had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth. Then I went
  to the store to buy some fish. Then...
- '...And then you threw an octopus at my window. You know, Zoidberg, it''s crazy
  but when you talk this way your obvious deficiencies as a male seem ... less obvious.
  Your genes seem less detrimental.  You even stink more.'
- Yes, well ... excuse me, I've got to powder my mouth flaps.
- Fry? You mean words of such beauty came from the blowhole of that hideous alien?
- Hmm.
- (from inside) Come in.
- (sexfully) Hello, Fry. Can I interest you in some surf and turf?
- Well that is where it comes out but jelly isn't everything.  I know Zoidberg's magical
  words were really yours. Teach me to love you, squishy poet from beyond the stars!
- Hush, you romantic fool! Engage your mandibles and kiss me!
- Oh, it's true, Zoidberg. We can't hide it any longer. Fry and I have fallen in love
  and we're going to mate tomorrow.
- And if you survive, we'll make sweet love!
- I do. I just want to say that today I got up and I had a piece of toast. Then I
  brushed my teeth--
- I love you, Fry!
- (screaming) Nooo! I can't stand to look.
EINSTEIN:
- Let's disco dance Hammurabi!
ELDERS:
- (chanting) Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
  Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
ELZAR:
- Hey, I'm Elzar! Welcome to the show! You know, you don't have to drive all the way
  to Neptune for great Neptunian food. Today we're gonna kick it up a notch as I show
  you how to fricassee a mouth-watering Neptunian slug.  Now while you grease the
  pan and preheat your oven to 3500 degrees you're gonna separate the yolk from your
  genetically-enhanced eggplant and then give the whole thing a good blast from your
  spice weasel - bam!
- 'Of course, your most important ingredient is this baby right here: the Neptunian
  slug. You can get it in a can but to really do things right you gotta strangle yourself
  a fresh one.  Now this is why you gotta use cast-iron cookware.'
- How we doing here?
- What are you, an ass kissing machine?
- You folks still doing alright?
- Good 'cause it turns out I forgot to cook that chicken.
- Now, this is why I prefer your non-stick robots.
- Hey, I hope you folks like Cajun food. 'Cause today we're making Elzar's down-home
  Neptune-style gumbo. Now, step one. You'll wanna boil some oysters in a pot of down-home
  Neptune-style gumbo.
- Of course, every now and then you'll wanna knock it up a notch with a blast from
  your spice weasel.  Bam!
- Jeez, who let this guy through the metal detector?
- If you promise to stop interrupting alright. Against my will, I'm gonna knock it
  up another notch.
- What, huh?
- Leela, please, let me make this up to you. You and your friends are all invited
  to my restaurant tonight. I'm gonna bam you up a dinner you'll never forget.
- Folks tell the neighbours to watch your mouth 'cause your tastebuds are going on
  vacation. I made you each your own special meal so dig in!
- Everybody enjoy their dinner?
- Well, I enjoyed cooking for you. And just to make everything completely square,
  I want you to have these complimentary after-dinner chocolates.
- Yeah, you take care of that whenever you want.
- Hey I made you a nice meal. This ain't a charity.
- OK OK wait. I know how to take care of this, no problem.
- No question.
- I don't know. I usually hire people who are a little less unbearable.
- OK, fine, I'll give it a shot.
- Bam!
- Let's just say they're very good customers and I'm not answering anymore questions.
- Yes.
- Hey, look at this crowd. You guys gotta try the pasta. It's got a real nice profit
  margin. Bam! So, special occasion tonight?
- Bam?
- Hey, that's terrific. To celebrate, I'm gonna stick seven copies of my latest cookbook
  on your bill.
- (shouting) Careful, that's a week old!
- Which one of you cutie muffins gets the children's spicy squab?
- And here's your check. Bam!
- (shouting) You little crooks! If I catch you I'm going to make cutie-muffin gumbo!
- Good evening Bender! And to your lady friends may I say - Bam!
- Enjoy our private dining room folks! This is where we serve our richest most successful
  chumps!
- Everything.
- Absolutely not.
- I owe you nothing! For starter's your antenna's in my crotch. Also I hate you. Finally,
  you can't cook for squat.
- I hate you.
- I knocked it up a notch. Bam!
- Get lost old man! Bam!
- Why you -
- Spargle huh? What he do, bland himself to death?
- OK but it seems like you're the one who killed him.
- Very well. We'll meet on the ancient televised battleground of Kitchen Coliseum!
  Whosever meal is best will claim the title of Iron Cook.
- Bam!
- No question.
- Table for two? Step right this way.
- OK then.
- Bam!
- I really appreciate that mister mayor's aide.  Here you go, compliments of the house.
- Freshen your coffee sir?
- What'll it be kids?
- 'Here you go big spender: Foie gras and caviar!'
- Hey, that's what rich people eat. The garbage parts of the food.
- Pee-yew! This fish is slightly too rotten to even make jambolaya!
- Hey ma'am, you sure can put it away! You saved me a trip to the dump! Bam!
- Well, I'd appreciate it if I did, so I guess we're even.
EMCEE:
- Gentle-hippies, put your filthy hands together for the folk stylings of Cylon and
  Garfunkel!
- And now, stand up and turn on your hidden tape recorders for...Beck! With special
  guest, Bender the broken robot.
ENOS:
- Well gadzooks Sarge!
- I did? Then I sure am lucky you knocked me onto this pile of rusty bayonets!
- Well, thanks soldier. I'm off to make Sarge's lunch! Handling raw chicken? It's
  part of the job!  Mmm! Finger licking good!
- Well gadzooks I'd better ask Sarge.
- You sure are the helpful type stranger! Say, you got anything to eat in that there
  lunchbox?  Ooo! Snack!
- Man, them crackers cut my mouth up somethin' bad! Let's stop off for a malt!
- See that waitress there?
- That's my fiance! Mildred.
- Uh, I'll have a pie with a fried egg on top.
- Yeah folks say that. But did you ever get the feeling you're only going with girls
  cos you're supposed to?
- Well, it ain't as bad as getting killed!
EVANS:
- Here's your package, Mr. Horrible Gelatinous Blob.
- Thank you, sir!
EVERYONE:
- Hello Joe.
FANSWORTH:
- Nothing will go wrong.  (whispering) If something goes wrong bring back the blood.
FARMER:
- Trespassers, eh?
- Ooh, that's a wicked sinful place. Tilt-a-whirl's OK, but the rest is mighty wicked.
- Huh, borry? Looky here, city girl, oxygen don't grow on trees. You'll have to earn
  it doing chores on my hydroponic farm. You can go back to your precious theme park
  at sun up.
- Yup. Drops down to -173!
- "First one, then th'other. And them spacesuits ain't a-heated so you ain\x92t goin'\
  \ nowhere til sunrise. You can sleep in the barn. Just don't be a-touchin' my three\
  \ beautiful robot daughters. Y'hear?"
- This here is Lulabelle 7.
- Daisy-Mae 128K.
- And the Crushinator.
- I'll learn ye to sleep with my robot daughters!
- Oh, no you don't! C'mere Crushinator.
- God darn, it Crushinator, jump!
- Had to come back for the Crushinator, eh, robot? Well I got you this time.
- Aww, dang it!
FARNSOWRTH:
- Hear, hear! Now let's all of us shut up and sing!
FARNSWORTH:
- Who are you?
- I don't have an Uncle Fry.
- By God, I am your nephew! This is absolutely incredible!
- Oh, my, no.
- Let me show you around. That's my lab table and this is my work-stool. And over
  there is my intergalactic spaceship! And here's where I keep assorted lengths of
  wire.
- I designed it myself. Let me show you some of the different lengths of wire I used.
- I suppose it is technically possible. Though I am already in my pyjamas.
- Can anyone drive stick?
- Three.
- Not necessarily. Are you three, by any chance, interested in becoming my new spaceship
  crew?
- Of those poor sons of -- but that's not important. The important thing is I need
  a new crew. Anyone interested?
- Oh, that won't be a problem. As luck would have it I saved the chips from my previous
  crew.
- If by that you mean "transporting cargo" then yes. It's a little home business I
  started to fund my research.
- You will be responsible for ensuring that the cargo reaches its destination.
- Exactly!
- As new employees I'd like your opinion on our commercial. I paid to have it air
  during the Superbowl.
- Not on the same channel, of course.
- No, no! That was all just special effects! Now let's have breakfast. I hope everyone
  likes eggs.
- Ah, Hermes! Crew, meet Hermes Conrad. He manages my delivery business, pays the
  bills, notifies next of kin, what have you.
- Oh, my! I haven't picked a new captain yet. It's always so hard to choose.
- Hmm, you!
- Now Fry, before you go into space you'll need to see our staff doctor. I should
  warn you though, he's a little unusual. (whispering) He wears sandals!
- Dr. Zoidberg, this is Fry, the new delivery boy. He needs a physical.
- You'll be fine.
- Dear Lord, Bender, you're filthy.
- Amy, why don't you give his body a going over with the cleaning pick?
- As soon as we finish cleaning Bender. Oh, and Fry, this is our intern, Amy Wong.
  She's an engineering student of mine. (whispering) I like having her around because
  she's the same blood type as me.
- Ah, to be young again. And also a robot! Now as I recall you youngsters have a package
  to deliver.
- Oh, dear! I really ought to do something. But I am already in my pyjamas.
- Oh, fuff! He's not causing any trouble. Now, if you don't mind, I'm rather busy.
  I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy. This sarcophagus should contain the remains
  of Emperor Nimballa, who ruled Zubin 5 over 29 million years ago.
- My God, this is an outrage! I was going to eat that mummy! Fry has got to go!
- Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly...? To shreds, you say. Well, how
  is his wife holding up...? To shreds, you say. Very well then.  Sad, sad, terrible,
  gruesome news about my colleague, Dr. Mobootu.
- This is for you, Fry  Zevulon the Great. He's teriyaki style.
- Fix it!
- Obviously your thoughts are being transmitted on the same frequency.
- Right, so long.
- Yes, let's all talk about Leela's personal life later. But right now we have business
  to attend to.
- No. A tax-deductible mission of charity.
- This is Vergon 6.
- It's a sunny little doomed planet, inhabited by a number of frisky little doomed
  animals.
- That's right. Animals in desperate need of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once filled
  with a super dense substance known as dark matter, each pound of which weighs over
  ten thousand pounds.
- Well, dark matter is extremely valuable as starship fuel. That's why it was all
  mined out, leaving the planet completely hollow.
- The wha?
- I didn't say anything about animals. Now it seems that the planet will collapse
  within three days. Incidentally, this will kill all the animals.
- Baseball? God forbid!
- Oh, yes!
- He's good, alright. But he's no Clem Johnson. And Johnson played back in the days
  before steroid injections were mandatory.
- Oh, dear Lord!
- It's...my...new pager.
- I'm sorry, wha?
- Great news, everyone. You'll be delivering a package to Chapek 9, a world where
  humans are killed on sight.
- I'm glad you asked that question, Fry. You see, Chapek 9 was colonised centuries
  ago by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists.
- They're not fans.
- Well then it's settled. So long, everyone!
- It's very simple. The ad gets into your brain just like this liquid gets into this
  egg.  Although in reality it's not liquid, but gamma radiation.
- I'm sorry, Fry, but the anchovy has been extinct since the 2200's.
- Oh, my, yes. Fished to death. Just about the time your people arrived on Earth wasn't
  it, Zoidberg?
- Uh, wha? Oh, yes, they say madness runs in our family. Some even call me mad! And
  why? Because I dared to dream of my own race of atomic monsters. Atomic supermen
  with octagonal-shaped bodies that suck blood out of...
- Good news, everyone...
- '...you''ll be making a delivery to the planet Trisol...'
- '...A mysterious world in the darkest depths of the Forbidden Zone.'
- Why, of course! Its just a name! Like the Death Zone or the Zone Of No Return. All
  the zones have names like that in the Galaxy Of Terror!
- Off you go, pleasant trip.
- Good news, everyone. Tomorrow you'll be making a delivery to Ebola 9, the virus
  planet.
- Because tonight's a special night and I want all of you to be alive. It's the Academy
  of Inventors annual symposium.
- It's the event of the scientific season. Every member presents an invention and
  the best one wins the Academy prize.
- Oh, my, yes. But not this year, because my latest invention is unbeatable. Behold!
  The death clock.  Simply jam your finger in the hole and this readout tells you
  exactly how long you have left to live.
- Well it's occasionally off by a few seconds. What with free will and all.
- Oh, my, yes.
- That's me at the very first symposium. I'm the Academy's oldest living member, you
  know. These youngsters all look up to me.
- Why don't you just leave me alone, Wernstrom?!
- You young turks think you know everything. I was inventing things when you were
  barely turning senile.
- A hundred years ago he was my most promising student at Mars University. But then
  after one fateful pop-quiz...
- I'm sorry but penmanship counts.
- 'And here it is: Slightly over 99 years later and still no revenge. I''m essentially
  in the clear.'
- Let's just say it'll put you young whippersnappers in your place!
- Uh, last year, you say?
- Oh, my! Did it put you young whippersnappers in your place?
- Oh, dear, I'll have to invent something new in the next ten minutes. Perhaps some
  sort of death clock.
- Just a second, just a second.
- Uh, yes, here I am, OK, now, hello there. Now, we all know telescopes allow us to
  see distant objects. But what if we want to smell distant objects? Well now we can!
  Thanks to my new invention...the Smellescope.
- The odour travels past this coffee stain here, around the olive pit and into this
  cigar burn. And this appears to be a, doodle of myself as a cowboy. But the Smellescope
  is brilliant, I tell you! Think of the astronomical odours you'll smell thanks to
  me.  Oh, my!
- Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a scientist.
- By God, you're right! I'm going to build that Smellescope!
- Eureka!
- No, I remembered that I'd built one last year. Go ahead. Try it. You'll find that
  every heavenly body has its own particular scent. Here, I'll point it at Jupiter.
- Exactly! And now Saturn.
- I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once
  and for all.
- Urectum. Here, let me locate it for you.
- What is it?  Oh, jeez! Oh, man! Remarkable! A stench so foul is right off the funk-o-meter.
  I dare say Fry may have discovered the smelliest object in the known universe.
- Hmm, perhaps the computer can calculate its trajectory.  My God! Whatever it is
  it's headed straight for us. With enough force to reduce this entire city to a stinky
  crater. We have less than 72 hours.
- Ah! Just as I thought. The answer lies in this movie I found on the Internet.
- Actually that's still true.
- So that's the situation. Due to the short-sightedness of Old New York, New New York
  is going to be destroyed by a giant ball of garbage.
- Please! There's no time for this now. This is an emergency. We must warn the mayor.
- Very serious, Mayor Poopenmeyer.
- Wernstrom!
- No, I'm here because a giant trash ball is heading straight for us. Smell for yourself.
- But suppose we send a crew to plant an explosive precisely on the fault line betwen
  this mass of coffee grounds and this deposit of America Online floppy disks.
- Now, you'll only have one chance to destroy the ball. After that, it will be so
  close to Earth that blowing it up would cause garbage to rain over the entire planet,
  killing billions.
- Now here's the bomb I've prepared. Once you activate it, you'll have 25 minutes
  to get away.
- Now, now, there'll be plenty of time to discuss your objections when and if you
  return.
- Oh, how could I have put that bomb timer on upside-down? I could swear I followed
  the manual precisely.  I'm a dried up husk of a scientist. This is all my fault.
- Wernstrom!
- Wait! If we could build an object the exact size, density and consistency of the
  garbage ball, it might just knock the ball away without smashing it to bits.
- Alas, I don't know.
- Good Lord! A second ball of garbage! That just might work!
- If my calculations are correct, this garbage ball will knock the other garbage ball
  directly into the sun.
- Five, four, three, two, three, four, five, six...
- Burning garbage!
- Yes! In your face, Wernstrom!
- Exactly! It's none of our concern.
- Good news, everyone! Today you'll be delivering a crate of subpoenas to Sicily 8,
  the Mob Planet!
- Yes.
- If only he had joined a mainstream religion like Oprah-ism or Voodoo.
- Oh, great news, everyone.
- In that case I'll have to hire a new crew to go on our company vacation.
- It's just my way of thanking you for not reporting my countless violations of safety
  and minimum wage laws.
- I've booked us all on the maiden voyage of the largest, most luxurious space cruise
  ship ever built.  The Titanic!
- Ah, here's my stateroom.
- Now, Hermes, you and your lovely wife LaBarbara have the suite through there. And
  Dr. Zoidberg, your marble tank is on the other side.
- It'll seem even nicer once you've seen your room.
- Ow!
- Though it did get me some action!
- Wait, I'm confused. Now tell me, Fry, which one of these ladies are you involved
  with?
- (shouting) I'm too young to die!
- Thank God there are plenty of escape pods; We won't have to dress up like women
  and children.
- I don't feel well!
- Oh, yes, absolutely!  Not a chance!
- Good news, everyone.  We've got a very special delivery today.
- Me.
- No, I need it shipped to my office at Mars University.  It's a little experiment
  that may well win me the Nobel Prize.
- I don't care, they all pay the same.
- Oh, my, no.  Off we go!
- Well, in those days Mars was just a dreary, uninhabitable wasteland, uh, much like
  Utah. But unlike Utah, it was eventually made livable, when the university was founded
  in 2636.
- Of course.
- Over here is Wong Library. It has the largest collection of literature in the Western
  universe.
- That's true. By current academic standards, you're merely a high school dropout.
- 'Same thing I teach every semester: The mathematics of quantum neutrino fields.
  I made up the title so that no student would dare take it.'
- Please, Fry, I don't know how to teach; I'm a professor!
- Oh!
- Ah, Fry, I see you've met Guenter!
- Guenter is my experiment. He was the top secret contents of this stinking crate.
- Oh, please! That's preposterous science-fiction mumbo-jumbo. Guenter's intelligence
  actually lies in his electronium hat which harnesses the power of sunspots to produce
  cognitive radiation.
- 'Please, stop bickering. I arranged that you be roommates for a reason: So I''d
  only have to remember one phone number. Now shake hands and make up.'
- And therefore, by process of elimination, the electron must taste like grapeade.
- Until 5pm?
- Don't be jealous. Without his special hat, Guenter might be no more intelligent
  than you.
- Fry, that monkey is my most important experiment. If you two don't stop fighting
  I'll have you both neutered.
- Oh, I'm glad you made it, Guenter because in honour of parents weekend I have a
  special surprise for you.
- What's that they're flinging at us?
- Look at him, I'm so proud.
- Not you.
- Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why? Why? Why didn't I break his
  legs?
- (crying) Oh, poor Guenter.
- I'm afraid so. All he handed in was a paper smeared with faeces. He tied with Fry.
- You what? After I spent months slaving over a hot monkey brain?
- But Guenter's obviously better off being intelligent. Tell him, Leela.
- What?
- What?
- Jungles? On Earth?
- Stand back.
- Don't worry. They'll be fine once the tranquiliser wears off.
- Come on, Guenter, take the hat.
- Consider the philosophical and metaphysical ramifications of the--
- Oh, dear Lord!
- Thank God this log is sturdy.  (shouting) Put on the hat, Guenter! You're the only
  one who can save us!  (muttering) Stupid monkey.
- Keep trying.
- We're saved!
- Oh, that poor, sweet monkey. Well lets go gather him up. There's no sense letting
  him go to waste.
- It seems to be working at only half-capacity, but I can fix it.
- But what about your super-intelligence?
- (screaming) Nooo!
- 'Ah, here we are: Monument Beach!'
- Come on, Zoidberg, I passed it right to you.
- Eh ... wha?  Oh, oh, OK, I think there's one can left.  Oh, my.
- Like a cheap French harlot.
- Oh, I should think so. Although last time aliens invaded all they did was force
  the most intelligent of us to pair off and mate continuously. (chuffed) Oh, yes!
- You'll be the captain, you'll be the delivery boy, and you'll be the alcoholic,
  foul-mouthed--  Oh, God, you're alive. I mean, thank God you're alive!  Sorry, check
  back in three days, a week at the most.
- (disappointed) I'm beginning to think there'll be no forced mating at all.
- Well, Omicron Persei 8 is about a thousand light years away. So the electro-magnetic
  waves would just recently have gotten there. You see--
- No, there wouldn't be. Most videotapes from that era were damaged in 2443 during
  the Second Coming of Jesus.
- I have an old five-megawatt broadcasting tower in the attic.
- Uh, (reading) Jenny McNeal, you are charged with jury-tampering in last week's case
  ...  ... on account of your hot, naked affair with the foreman. How do you plead?
- (reading) Your witness, Prosecutor Ramirez.
- (reading) What say you, Single Female Lawyer?
- (reading) Miss McNeal, I'm afraid I must decline your offer of marriage. For, you
  see, I'm dying. Cough, then fall over dead.
- According to Bender's temperature gauge, which I suggest you use next time, Leela,
  he's running a fever of ... 900 degrees.
- Or a big fat placebo. It's all the same crap.
- It may well be the cause of Bender's illness. But more importantly, it's a flimsy
  pretext to try out my latest invention. To the laboratory!
- I call this the F-ray. It's like an X-ray only it allows you to see through anything
  - even metal. Now, the neutrino beam it emits is a tad dangerous, so you'll all
  need protective goggles. You may feel a slight stinging sensation - all of you--
  All of you!  Aha! There's the cause of your illness.
- Well, I've got to go take this suit to the decontaminators. You two lock up the
  F-ray and for the love of God don't let it fall into the wrong hands.
- Oh, my!
- Who are those horrible orange creatures over there?
- Tell them I hate them.
- Ooh!
- 'Commissioner, my crew has made a horrific discovery: It seems that Slurm is produced
  in a colossal worm hiney!'
- I'm not your grandpa, you're my uncle! From the year 2000!
- (simultaneously) For Slurms!
- Happy birthday, young Nibbler.
- 'And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet Nibbler, who''s gone to a place where
  I too hope one day to go: The toilet.'
- Actually, through the miracle of science, that can be arranged.
- I need to tinker in it.
- Quiet, you. I'm installing an empathy chip.
- Yes. If by "allow" you mean "force".
- Oh dear, oh my. I got it. Once more.
- Steady now.
- There we go.  Now I'll simply tune it to Leela's emotional frequency.
- Hmm.
- Oh, don't be so sure. Many scientists believe humans really could mutate down there.
  Uh, due to exposure to toxic waste and radioactive runoff and good old American
  faeces.
- That was a disgusting story.
- Bender, you won't believe this, but the empathy chip burned out. The emotion you
  felt for Nibbler was actually your own.
- No, I'm wrong. The empathy chip was running at triple capacity.
- So long!
- Good news, everyone.  We have a mission to further the noble cause of intergalactic
  peace.
- It's a delivery for the Democratic Order Of Planets.
- It's similar to the United Nations from your time, Fry.
- Tonight is the ribbon-cutting for the DOOP's new headquarters.
- Something without which no ribbon-cutting ceremony could proceed. The ceremonial
  oversized scissors.
- Alright, but don't run with them.
- Leela, who are you talking to?
- Why, you're that disgraced starship captain.  Having him on staff will distract
  people from our horrendous safety record. Come in.
- I'd like everyone to meet our new employees. (whispering) Which ones are new?
- Hmm, I could swear I've never seen that robot before either.
- Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course. Anyway, whoever you all are, I have good
  news. You'll be making a delivery to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high gravity
  you'll most likely be crushed under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy.
- (whispering) That a girl! If they don't take him back we can keep him as captain.
- Oh, foo!
- No time off.
- But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.
- Yes, that's a capital idea. Let's all go register.
- The very instant I became old.
- The problem with both parties is that they always want to give your tax dollars
  to the less fortunate.
- So what are you doing to protect my constitutional right to bear doomsday devices?
- Damn straight! Today, the mad scientist can't get a doomsday device, tomorrow it's
  the mad grad student. Where will it end?
- Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been down that road. I know it's glamorous and
  the parties are great but you'll end up spending every dollar you make on jewellery
  and skintight pants.
- Don't you have a self-destruct button?
- I can't believe it. He won by a single vote.
- Come on, everyone. Perhaps some skiing will help us forget the mouldy old antics
  of Conan O'Brien.
- Wha?
- What-mas?
- Eh wha?
- Pine trees have been extinct for 800 years, Fry. Gone the way of the poodle and
  your primitive notions of modesty. Ah! Brisk!
- There, there.
- Yes, and the only one of her species in all the known universe. What a lonely life.
- You should be ashamed of yourself, Fry. You'd have to be blind not to notice that
  Leela's a cyclops.
- Oh?
- Good Lord! He doesn't know about Santa Claus.
- Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot Company built a robotic Santa to determine who'd
  be naughty and who'd been nice and distribute presents accordingly. But something
  went wrong.
- Wait, you fool! Due to a programming error, Santa's standards were set too high
  and he invariably judges everyone to be naughty.
- Nice meeting you.
- Huh? You were gone?
- Oh, dear. They'll be killed on our doorstep. And there's no trash pickup until January
  3rd.
- Quick! The armour-plated chimney cover! Push! Push!
- Yes, good thing I got us out of that one!
- Merry Xmas, everyone!
- Now, now, this won't do. Let me just give old Zoidy a sedative.
- Mm-hm...  Oh-ho!  Aha! There's the problem.
- Relax, my chiton-y chum. There's no problem. You're just heavy with male jelly.
- It must be mating season for Zoidberg's people. A chaotic time when his behaviour
  is dictated by the tiny brain in his rump.
- There's only one thing we can do...
- '...We, by which I mean you, will have to rush him to his ancient homeworld which
  will shortly erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex.'
- Do I hear wedding bells?
- Really? Oh, dear.
- I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me graft a laser cannon onto your
  chest. To crush those who disobey you. But I guess we're just two different people.
- We did all we could.
- Good as new? Yes.
- Leela, Zoidberg, the rest of you, this is Flexo.
- Everyone get in bed with me. I have something to show you.  Feast your eyes on this!
- It's a single atom of jumbonium. And element so rare, the nucleus alone is worth
  more than $50,000.
- 100,000. That's why I hid it here. Under my mattress.
- Why certainly.
- The atom sits atop this dime stored tiara which will be awarded to the winner of
  this years Miss Universe pageant on the planet Tova 9.  Your job is to deliver it,
  safe and sound.
- Due to the atom's tremendous value, Planet Express would go bankrupt if it was stolen.
  Therefore we'll need to hire on additional security for the mission.
- Flexo's great you say? Well that's good enough for me.  Welcome aboard lad.
- Good news, everyone. I've taught the toaster to feel love.  And Hermes returns from
  his vacation today.
- Yo!
- Sounds great, Hermes! Whatever you say. (whispering) Let's ditch him and go to the
  movies!
- Down in front!
- Aw. They don't make movies like this anymore.
- There are no rules. Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Then later the other robot
  leaves after being declared the winner.
- Oh, did I mention the crippling, agonising pain? I'm pretty sure I did. Oh, yes,
  definitely.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Oh, good. Just let me put on my reading glasses.  Why, Zoidberg, there's a lovely
  photo of you in here.
- Poor little guy starved to death.
- Good news everyone! Several years ago I tried to log on to AOL, and it just went
  through! Wheee! We're online!
- Go ahead! Get into these net suits. I designed and tested them myself.
- Really? I guess when you're around it all day you stop noticing. Off you go.
- Everyone please sign off, we have a delivery. Plus I have to use the phone -  Leela
  please tell the others that -
- Saving a race of one-eyed monsters? Who could object to that?
- No harm done. In the many decades you'll work to repay me for that shipment of popcorn
  you destroyed, you'll have plenty of time to search for your true home.
- That's a full time job.
- Oh yes we must, yes.
- You can't just waltz into the Central Bureaucracy. It's a tangled web of red tape
  and regulations. I've never been but a friend of mine went completely mad trying
  to find the washroom there.
- Oh I've been there. Lot's of times!
- Well it doesn't look like I'll make it inside with the rest of you. Uh but good
  luck. Just leave me where I drop.
- Wonderful.
- Dammit Hermes, just jump already. Stop hogging that healthy liver.
- Well, it looks like I'll be needing my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely reduced
  pay of course.
- Good news everyone, the university is bringing me up on disciplinary charges! Wait,
  that's not good news at all.
- Yes but they won't listen. Everyone's always in favour of saving Hitler's brain
  but when you put it in the body of a great white shark (sarcastic) ooo, suddenly
  you've gone too far.
- Listen to me you pompous frauds, if I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me.
  Dean Vernon, I know the truth. It was you driving your hover-car that night, not
  your horse. Dean Epsilon, I know all about your "Department Of Pool Boy Studies."
  And Dr Wernstrom...Werrrnstrom!
- And you Coach Smalley, or should I say "Coach hairpiece"?
- (muttering) Hundred and...what? Oooh!
- Eh wha?
- Uh, what a pleasure it is to see my lifetime of accomplishments summed up in a 3-minute
  film. My best years are behind me. So much left undone. So little time.
- My life is over.
- So many loves half-loved. So many inventions half-invented. That damn time machine
  alone set me back 15 years.
- There's no one to carry on after I'm gone. No one to take care of my work and my
  research and my fabulous fortune. By God, that's it! I've got to name a successor.
- There's no time to lose. I'm off to my lab to build a successor-naming machine!
- Everyone, I have a very dramatic announcement. So anyone with a weak heart should
  leave now. Goodbye.
- Oh yes, the announcement! As you all know, I am not long for this world...
- '...So I''ve picked my successor. It''s someone in whom I have great faith - even
  though his mind is undeveloped and he''s accomplished nothing.  My closest living
  relative...'
- My clone, Cubert Farnsworth.
- 12 years ago I began the cloning process by removing some skin cells from one of
  the shaplier growths on my back.
- I left him in his first tube too long and he got squished up against the side.
- Let's find out.
- Oh Cubert, come in here. I have something amazing to show you.
- As my successor I'm trusting you to carry on my work. These are just some of the
  half finished inventions you'll spend your life finishing.
- That's my prizewinning smelloscope. If a dog craps anywhere in the universe, you
  can bet I won't be out of the loop. And this is my universal translator. Unfortunately
  so far it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language.
- Crazy gibberish!
- Why certainly. Step over here.
- These are the dark matter engine I invented. They allow my starship to travel between
  galaxies in mere hours.
- Of course not. That's why scientists increased the speed of light in 2208.
- And what makes my engines truly remarkable is the afterburner which delivers 200%
  fuel efficiency.
- Not at all. It's very simple.
- Now that's impossible. It came to me in a dream and I forgot it in another dream.
- Nothing is impossible. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being is a scientist
  is all about.
- Oh it's a gem of an evening! I feel so wonderful having someone to take over my
  life work! And it's all thanks to Cubert.
- You...wha?
- But-But what about my hopes and my dreams and my wonderful inventions?
- Bad news everyone. By the time you watch this tape, I'll be gone. Leaving by nothing
  but a history of failure and my original hipbones. You see, I've been lying about
  my age. I'm not actually 150. I'm 160. Oh vanity, thy name is Professor Farnsworth.
  And now that I've nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take
  me away.
- Goodbye cruel world.  Goodbye cruel lamp.  Goodbye cruel velvet drapes, lined with
  what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin......and the cute little pompom
  curtain pull cords, cruel though they may be a -
- Eh...whuh...
- I'm as spry as a 140 year old.  See? I only broke one ankle.
- Oh, they had me hooked up to a bizarre virtual world that seemed absolutely real.
- It was as though I was living in a facility in Florida with hundreds of other old
  people. All day long we'd play bingo, eat oatmeal and wait for our children to call.
- Oh my yes. Thank you all for saving me. Especially you my little clone. No matter
  what you decide to do with your life, I'm still proud of you.
- Don't worry son. You will. Incidentally, you might want to read up on a condition
  known as "wandering bladder."
- No reason. No reason at all.
- Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic Ocean. This seems the logical place for fish
  to congregate.
- Indeed so.
- Yeah, cool.
- You'll never catch anything with that primitive technology. What you need is this
  fish pheromone.  The most potent aphrodisiac known to fishkind.  Uh-oh!
- Oh, my!
- Bender, be careful. That's the ships diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable.
- It belonged to my grandmother.
- It's not snagged, the mechano man has caught something!  Sweet Zombie Jesus! It's
  huge!
- A colossal-mouth bass!
- Dear Lord, that's over 150 atmospheres of pressure.
- Well it's a spaceship, so I'd say anywhere between zero and one.
- That should do it.
- Not necessarily. This is chance for Fry to test out my experimental anti-pressure
  pill.
- Well then good news! It's a suppository.
- You're simply hallucinating, you ... moron.
- He may have ocean madness but that's no excuse for ocean rudeness.
- "I'm almost finish reconfiguring the ships propulsion system. We can leave as soon\
  \ as the paper-m\xE2ch\xE9 is dry."
- No, I've been busy.
- We'll form a search party. Now, we'll need oxygen.
- 'Ooh, that reminds me: You''ve all taken your pressure pills, right?'
- Could it possibly be? Are the old legends true?  It is! It's the fabled lost city
  of Atlanta!
- This is uncomfortable and humiliating. Now, if they could put it in the form of
  a suppository.
- Yes, we all miss our loved ones and gases. Come on, Fry.
- Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac, be reasonable. Don't you realise that if
  you stay at this depth your body will permanently adapt to the pressure?
- It means you'll never be able to return to the surface.
- (shouting) I'm bored! Let's go!
- (shouting) Let's go, damnit! Let's go!
- Bye.
- There! The engine modifications are complete.
- Oh my. That steamed carrot was a bit spicy for me.
- Holy Zombie Jesus!
- You look beautiful. Incidentally, my favourite artist is Picasso.
- Better yet, I'll build someone to fill in for you.  Some kind of gamma powered mechanical
  monster, with freeway on-ramps for arms and a heart as black as coal...
- Where am I now?
- (shouting) Hey! Unless this is a nude love-in, get the hell off my property!
- I can, but that's because I'm not a penniless hippie.
- There's one way, and only one way, to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect
  its brain!
- Enough chit-chat. Restrain the specimen!
- Dear Lord, they're back!
- A toast to Leela. She showed us it's wrong to eat certain things.
- Good, good.
- Toss me the speech centre of the brain!
- Good news. There's a report on TV with some very bad news.
- Moron!
- It'll be the end of civilised society.
- 'We could use my new invention: A pointy rock tied to a stick.'
- Defend the fire!
- Wha?  W-What do you want from me?
- Played pelvic pinochle? I'm afraid so.
- It's a humiliating story that I hope never to tell. Well, pull up a chair.
- (voice-over) Our paths first crossed when I was a researcher at Mom's Friendly Robot
  Company.  The moment our eyes met, we knew we'd be going at it like woodchucks.
- (voice-over) She was my first love - or at least the earliest one I can still remember.
  But then, 70 years ago today...
- Good news, Mom. I've invented a new children's toy.  I call it "Q.T. McWhiskers"!
  When you pet it, it shoots rainbows from its eyes.
- But things 8 feet tall aren't cute! That's why my Colossal Tammy Tinkle Doll was
  such a failure. Oh, you don't understand me. We're finished!
- Make up with her? After she went all psycho when I thought everything was cool?
  Impossible!
- The thought of caressing that leathery hide makes the tapioca rise in my gullet.
- Very well. If cop a feel I must, then cop a feel I shall!
- Never fear. My magic fingers still know how to do their stuff!
- Show us this, "the wheel".
- I'm ready to seduce. I'm wearing my kissing dentures and my evening truss.
- I was out fleeing some robots and the silvery moonlight glinting off their bloody
  claws made me think of you.
- Uh-huh. May I come in?
- Here, I brought you these.
- You favourite what? Why does my foot hurt?
- And you broke mine. Granted, that was four or five hearts ago.
- Oh, inventing, sending delivery crews to their doom, breeding atomic monsters.
- And your skin still dangles so gracefully from your neck.
- No, it was silly of me to object. One foot tall, eight feet, 15 feet; what does
  it matter?
- 16 feet? Go to hell! I was a fool to think you'd changed, you old bat!
- (shouting) Damned she-fossil!
- (thinking) Here we go. Just unhook it and get the remote. So many hooks! Come on,
  Farnsworth. Drat, the first one's back on again! I give up! Wait! Victory!  Oh,
  my. Now I'll just...the remote...I'll just... (talking) Oh, my.
- Oh, yes.
- I love you, Mom. Let's grow ancient together.
- 'Look: It started out as a calculated plot to rummage through your underwear. But
  once I got in there, I found more - much more. And now I want to shout our love
  from the rooftops. Perhaps I''ll breed some sort of albino shouting gorilla.'
- But, dustcakes...
- Yes. But I'll always love her in my own subtle way.
- Good news, everyone! I've invented a device that allows you to operate equipment
  from great distances. I call it "the fing-longer".  Observe.  And, here we go.  There!
- Pretty long, eh?
- Oh, that's just the What-If machine I invented. You pose it a What-If question and
  it generates a video simulation of what would happen.
- Of course it works!  It's just not very long.
- Nothing except and even equally big monster. This is chance to try out my experimental
  enlarging ray. But we'll need a guinea pig.
- Gotcha!
- Well, Leela, care to give the What-If machine a whirl?
- Leela, could you come in here for a moment. I have something important to tell you.
- I can't live forever and I need an heir. Someone to spend my vast riches and take
  care of my man-eating anteaters when I'm gone.  The others simply aren't level-headed
  enough. They're too impulsive. Not like you. Not like old, predictable, dull-as-dishwater
  Leela.
- That's why I've made you my sole heir. The day I die, you'll be a very wealthy woman.
  Oh, my, yes. Incredibly wealthy. The day I die. Because you're so unimpulsive.
- Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Fry?
- We're not seeing it again! Ask something less stupid.
- That question is less stupid, though you asked it in a profoundly stupid way.  What
  would happen if Fry never came to the future?
- It appears that the very fabric of space-time has ripped.
- That story was preposterous. Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria! This thing isn't worth
  the gold it's made of.  Anyway, the fing-longer seems to be arousing success.
- So that's what things would be like if I'd invented the fing-longer.  A man can
  dream though. A man can dream.
- Fuf! Superstitious robot mumbo-jumbo.
- Yes, you idiot.  The circuit diagram is right here on the inside of your case.
- Hmm.  It has motor eye sensors attached to motion detectors.
- Just as I suspected. These robots were buried in improperly shielded coffins. Their
  programming leaked into the castles wiring through this old, abandoned modem allowing
  them to project themselves as holograms.
- Yes, that sequence of words I said made perfect sense. We really should tell Bender
  there's nothing to be afraid of.
- Now be careful, Fry. And if you kill anyone, make sure to eat their heart, to gain
  their courage. Their rich, tasty courage.
- Well, that's it. Let's reactivate him. (shouting) Wake up!
- It's stuck in there with glue or something. I don't know.
- Leela, have you seen the keys to the spaceship?
- Eh, wha'? I mean, what?
- You've gone too far this time - all three of you!
- You left the keys in the ignition. I mean, look at those two. Wasn't it obvious
  what would happen?
- I should fire you three right now, but I'm just not that cold-hearted.
- Yes, yes! Let's all talk to Zoidberg.
- So, Zoidberg. What's new?
- I'm sorry, Og, but I've got a new crew.
- So, how was delivery to Fantasy Planet, where everyone's fantasies come to life?
- You see, Og? Everything's running smoothly, yes. And with Fry fired, I can finally
  leave my jigsaw puzzles out without him eating the pieces.
- This can only end badly, Fry. Kids, a house -
- You were in Pauly Shore's tube and they were delivering it to his movie screening.
- You wish! You're in Los Angeles!
- Why, I've forgotten why I even fired you.
- Oh, that's right. Get lost.
- Fry, did you eat anything unusual recently?
- Egg salad? Hmm. Zoidberg will have to examine your gastrointestinal tract. Come
  everyone, give Fry some privacy.
- If you can't see well enough through the two-way mirror, there'll be a close-up
  on this video screen.
- Watch for any subtle irregularity in Fry's bowel.
- Correct! Worm eggs! And the mayonaise was probably none too fresh either.
- Only one. We'll have to travel deep inside Fry, in this!
- In each gastro-survival kit, you'll find a rain slicker, a disposable fun camera,
  and something to protect you against bacteria.... - a harpoon!
- Oh my no. That would require extrememly tiny atoms. And have you priced those lately?
  I'm not made of money - leave me alone!
- Anyhoo, your net suits will let you experience Fry's worm-infested bowels as if
  you were actually wriggling through them.
- Is everyone present?
- 'Heres the plan:  We''ll enter the ear, drip down the back of the throat and make
  for the bowel. There, we''ll irritate the pelvic splachnic ganglion and cause an
  intestinal spasm, expelling - among other things - the parasites.'
- No, Fry can't know anything about the mission. If he finds out, the worms will try
  to defend themselves. They know everything he knows.
- Leela, your role is to distract Fry so he doesn't notice what we're up to.
- Wait, we just have to get past the eardrum!
- Brace yourselves everyone. We're entering the interior of Fry's nose!
- Let's just pray nothing stimulates the delicate smell receptors. (whispering) Nobody
  make a smell.
- We're in the heart. Better known as "the love muscle."
- We should be safe, just so long as nothing makes it beat faster.
- No! Set course for that cholesterol-encrusted valve.
- No, don't give up now! we're but a stones throw from the pyloric sphinchter.
- There it is! The stately capitol of Fry's bowel. A heavily guarded fortress surrounding
  the pelvic splachnic ganglion.
- If we can stimulate that nerve, the bowel will convulse, expelling the entire worm
  society.
- Listen, this is gonna be one hell of a bowel movement. Afterwards he'll be lucky
  if he has any bones left!
- The nerve is through here. Where's Zoidberg?
- There it is! The pelvic splachnic ganglion. Tickle it and get ready for the ride
  of your lives!
- Leela, you're just in time to help. If we don't get rid of the worms now, they'll
  burrow so deep into the bowel that not even Hermes' famous jerk prunes could dislodge
  them!
- Fry will be stuck with the worms forever.
- Leela you ignorant dope! Now the worms will be in Fry forever.
- Oh that's stupid!
- He always seemed so full of life. Laughing, singing, begging for scraps. And now
  this.
- Stop doing that!
- What's all the hubbub?
- That you for your sympathy, talking square of linoleum.
- Dear God! We've got robots on the ceiling.
- Then he can't stay here. He's a menace to every straight person in the company.
  Go satisfy your bend lust and don't you come back to work until you do.
- What an exquisite day. That azure sky, the verdant treetops.  Those delightful birds
  with their chirp, chirp, chirp and their tweet, tweet, splat.
- Hmm. I'm not quite sure. Perhaps seeing things from a new perspective has reminded
  me of life's beauty. Or perhaps my new posture is causing blood to pool in the back
  of my brain, resulting in a mild delirium. Incidentally, you have a dime up your
  nose.
- My new bent outlook has completely re-energised me. I'm even dating a young Brazilian
  retired actress.
- Some say I'm robbing the cradle but I say she's robbing the grave.
- I was just regaling your former co-workers with a tale of bedroom antics, the likes
  of which--
- So, Bender, tell us about this new girlfriend of yours.
- Obsessing won't help, Bender. Take a lean back and enjoy life.
- Perhaps it's your outlook that needs a good bend. A 90-degree bend to a place where
  happiness is perpendicular to wonderment.
- 'Nonsense. It''s just like in the song I wrote:'
- (singing) You gotta dangle, Have a new angle, Wangle a new dangle on life.
- I'm sad now.
- Zooka barooka! First prize is $500 and a year's supply of dog food!
- Good news, everyone. We were supposed to make a delivery to the planet Tweenis 12
  but it's been completely destroyed.
- They paid in advance.
- Ow. Ow. Ow.  I'm a genius. Ow. Ow.
- Duh, I know! Let's play the lottery!
- The professy will help!  Fire indeed hot!
- Why, I've been a Harold Zoid fan since back when my hips were made of bone. As it
  happens, I still have some of my original 78s.
- Good news everyone! I'm sending you on an extremely controversial mission!
- Oh my no.
- For this highly controversial mission, you'll be towing the Juan Valdez, an orbitting
  supertanker full of rich Columbian dark matter.
- Impossible!  The tanker has 6000 hulls. So, unlike me, it's entirely leak-proof!
  Now, once you've hauled the tanker past the protestors -
- Correct. 6000 hulls.
- (whispering) To avoid the tollbooth.
- What are you yapping about?
- This is an outrage. I demand that you hand over your captain's jacket.
- I said hand it over!  Well Fry, or should I say Captain Fry?  No I shouldn't. Because
  Bender is the new captain!
- That's right. Being a captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain can't
  have either one. That's why cold, logical Bender is perfect for the job.
- No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it.
- Dirt doesn't need luck.
- So you opened the record vault and the clover was gone?
- Shut up friends. My internet browser heard us saying the word "Fry" and it found
  a movie about Philip J. Fry for us.  It alwso opened my calendar to Friday and ordered
  me some French fries.
- Phaser eye surgery is a capital idea. I'm sure Leela's tired of morons gaping at
  her eye all the time.
- Thatagirl!
- That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard you imbecile!
- No.
- And Fry, you've got that brain thing.
- She's right!
- Good news, everyone! Today marks our dear friend Dr. Zoidberg's 10th year with Planet
  Express. Huzzahs are in order.
- Keep your chin up!
- Oh, don't worry, Fry. I too once spent a nightmare-ish time in a robot asylum. But
  now it's nearly over. So long.
- What a relief!
- You're going to do his laundry?
- Ouch! That's going to bleed when my heart beats.
- Where's the device that lets you speed or slow the passage of time?
- Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas. Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038.
- Go on, you dummy.
- Well, let's drag him to the kerb.
- Wha?
- This will not stand!  I'll take you on, you air-balling bozos.
- I may be an old man - in fact, I'm fairly sure I am - but I'll put you Globetrotters
  in your place with my team of mutant atomic supermen!
- 'Behold: My mutant atomic supermen.'
- Well, they're still young. Mere atomic super boys, really. We'll need to speed up
  their growth with time particles called Chronitons.
- Good news, everyone. You're off to the Tempest Nebula to gather Chronitons.
- None too soon. While you were gone the Trotters held a news conference to announce
  that I was a jive sucker.  Behold! My invincible nuclear mutants.
- No showboarding, you atomic hotdog!
- What the?  Did everything just jump around? Or did my brain just stroke off there
  for a second?
- Time-out! Time-out!
- We seem to be lurching forward randomly in time, like a needle skipping on a record
  player.
- No. It must have something to do with those time particles I used to grow the Supermen.
  Time and space are ripping apart at the seams.
- Oh, great. Now, on top of everything, we need a new fifth man.
- Hmm. Will said skills pay the bills?
- Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes. We have bigger problems. This time
  disruption is extremely serious.
- Tate? What do you know about this?
- You're that Bubblegum Tate?
- Yes, I see. Something involving that many big words could easily destabilise time
  itself.
- Indeed so. At this rate, by Tuesday it will be Thursday; By Wednesday, it will be
  August and by Thursday, it will be the end of existence as we know it.
- Interesting. It's as if we behave normally during the time skips, but then we have
  no memory of it.
- '...my, yes. Ooh, just like that. Any luck Bubblegum?'
- Not if you'll grant me the same liberty.
- Bubblegum, look at this. The background time radiation is fluctuating wildly.
- Ah, there is it. The Tempest Nebula. Take a whiff through the smellescope.
- The odour of pure time leaking. When my crew removed the Chronitons, it destabilised
  the nebula, causing time skips throughout the universe.
- Their gravity might just divert the Chronitons to the empty side of the universe.
- Wha?
- Ah, there we are. One gravity pump. Powerful enough to move the stars themselves.
  Now to begin the arduous task of attaching it to the ship so th -
- Off you go - apparently.
- Ye Gods, Bubblegum, we failed. The time skips haven't stopped at all.
- No wonder we failed to stop the time skips. Diverting Chronitons is mathematically
  impossible. I knew I should have checked your showboating Globetrotter algebra.
- The time skips are worse than ever now. Isolated spots are jumping by years at a
  time. Look.
- Well, I'm stumped. We'll have to call in the finest scientific minds in the univ
  -
- Perhaps we could explode the whole damned nebula. What do you think, Curly Joe?
- By God, Sweet Clyde is right. An implosion might just form a black hole that would
  stop more Chronitons from escaping.
- Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court.  I suppose I could part
  with one and still be feared.
- Boring? Wasn't that the period where they cracked the human genome and boy bands
  roamed the Earth?
- No. Why would I know that?
- No, just the two.
- Yes it's been quite an hour and a half.
- Onto the internet you go!
- Download her. Let's just put a blank robot in the drive.
- Well duh! She's programmed to like you!
- Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop and he's an idiot. Well, that's love for
  you.
- It's just lucky I keep a copy in the VCR at all times!
- 'I knew I should have shown him Electro Gonhorrhea: The Noisy Killer.'
- Focus!
- And what's this layer of ozone? That's never been there before.
- Remarkable! According the high precision digital chronograph it's July 9th 1947.
  Which would explain why the chronograph has turned into this pin-up calendar.
- Doy! Some idiot must have put metal in the microwave...
- '...and the microwave''s radiation combined with the gravitons and graviolis from
  the supernova blasted us through Time itself.'
- And the alien they captured was...was...
- Yes we tore the universe a new space-hole alright! But it's clenching shut fast.
  Our only hope of getting back to our own time is to go through it in oh say......exactly
  24 hours.
- You've got 8. But a more urgent concern is the microwave.  Without a working one
  we have no hope of returning to the future.
- Your grandfather?  Stay away from him you dimwitted monkey. You mustn't interfere
  with the past. Don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you
  were supposed to do it. In which case. for the love of God, don't not do it!
- If for example you were to kill your grandfather, you would cease to exist!
- Ooo that's good news! You know you really don't cook enough roast Leela!  Ooo. Women!
- I'll have the soylent green, with a slice of soylent orange and some soylent coleslaw.
- Oh right!  I'll have a croque monsieur, the paella, two mutton pills and a stein
  of mead!
- Oh Lord! We'll have to endure the horrible music of the big bopper, and then the
  terrible tragedy of his death.
- No! That would alter history. Above all else, it is our sacred duty to preserve
  the past exactly as it was.
- Wha?
- What the hell have you done Fry?
- Start the ship Leela. Let's just steal the damned radar dish and get back to our
  own time!
- Oh a lesson in not changing history from Mr I'm-My-Own-Grandpa! Let's get the hell
  out of here already! Screw history!
- Huh wha? Oh right!
- Choke on that causality!
- Impossible. The supernova timehole is closing! If we don't leave now, we'll never
  get back to the 31st century!
- Well, now everything is back as it was. And if history doesn't care that out degenerate
  friend Fry is his own grandfather, then who are we to judge?
- Cover that fireplace, confound you! I've only a few years to live. I don't wanna
  spend them dead.
- Oh, we're doomed! Every year we're doomed. Thanks be I had these bullet-proof shutters
  installed.
- Bring it on, Santa! That bloodthirsty cadaver junkie can't touch us as long as we're
  not stupid enough to leave this building.
- In a related matter, you'll be delivering this sack of children's letters directly
  to Santa at his death fortress on Neptune.
- Yes, yes, yes. You sound like a broken mp3!
- (shouting) No!
- There he is again!
- But it's not boring!
- No heat.
- That's a big crock of--  Hold me!
- There. I've finished fine tuning my What If? machine. It can answer any What If?
  question, accurate to within 1/10th of a plausibility unit.
- Who wants the machine to show them an alternate reality?
- Oh lordy loo! There he goes again. Well, let's give baby what he wants.  What if
  Bender were human?
- Good news everyone. I've discovered a way to make Bender human using a process I
  call "reverse fossilisation."
- Well, in regular fossilisation, flesh and bone turn to minerals. Realising that,
  it was a simple matter to reverse the process. I've already tested it by turning
  the toaster into a racoon.
- Are you ready Bender?
- It worked! Eat it everyone who never won a Nobel Prize! And that includes you Amy!
- Speak for yourself!
- Come Bender, its time to go home and rest. I need you in top shape next week when
  I present you to the Nobel Prize committee. Bender?
- Uh as I've said before, I used reverse fossilisation, which is the reverse of regular,
  uh...
- Ah, them without further stalling for time, I present to the Nobel judges, the first
  robot ever turned into a human.
- This, uh, scientific breakthrough, uh, heralds a new dawn in human-robot relations
  yes.
- And, uh thats why I believe I deserve the Nobel Prize.
- Weee!
- Care to say a few words Bender?
- About 12 hours ago when the party started.
- No. That was air escaping from the folds of his fat.  Goodnight sweet prince. You
  were the greatest man any of us will ever know. Well lets get him out of here. He's
  starting to smell up the joint.
- Who else has a question for the What If? machine? Scruffy? Katrina? Xanfor?
- Can you put that in the form of a question?
- Oh great machine we beseech thee. What if life were more like a video game?
- Monkies aren't donkies! Quit messing with my head!
- Forget it you pixelated pirates. We need those quarters to do our laundry.
- Well, there's time for one last question. Let's turn to the Who Ask machine to see
  who's next.
- I am the Professor. Great and...uh...forgetful! Now what do you nice kids want?
- Oh blithery poop my cowardly lobster! You don't need courage. Afterall, who needs
  courage when you have a gun?
- And you lad, all you need is brain.
- Here you go my friend. 5000 Professor Land fun bucks!
- As for you young lady, you want to go home right?
- Nonsense. Now click your big honking boots together three times and wish to go home
  to Kansas, to live in poerty with your dirt farming, teetotalling aunt and uncle.
- Oh, so close.
- We'll need to look our best if we're to get the account of our new potential customer
  Romanticorp!
- Everyone suit up. We're off to the most romantic city on Earth!
- Remember, we've got to show these people we're not bitter husks of human beings
  who long ago abandoned hope of finding love in this lifetime. Leela you'll have
  to do some acting.
- You know, romance is an important part of our work too, uh right everyone?
- So, do we have the contract?
- With that big new Romanticorp contract, I've been able to make those government
  mandated upgrades you've all been suing me about.
- Oh it must have been the ship's new improved personality software I installed.
- It even comes with an adjustable voice.
- Good news, everyone! You all know the orphanarium where Leela grew up?
- Well done, fellows! Anyway, said orphanarium has named Leela orphan of the year.
- And the good news keeps on coming. Behold my latest invention.
- Ta-da! It's a glow-in-the-dark nose you can wear over your regular non-glowing nose.
  Observe.
- That? It's uh...nothing. Yes, nothing. If you think it's anything you're a suspicous
  moron.
- Alright, alright so the machine produces a few toxic by-products! You don't have
  to make a federal case out of it.
- Hmm, I know that's a rip but I'll pay for the convenience. Do you take credit cards?
- Of course. But only into Beta Crypt 3, a language so complex, there's even less
  chance of understanding it.
- Very well.
- It can do other things. Why shouldn't it?  Of course, even if it is possible to
  analyse the message there's no way of knowing how long it would take. It could take
  an hour or it could take a hundred million years.
- Certainly not. Two dings means it's done.  But not like that. Slightly more rapid.
- That's it, it's done!  I can't believe it! My mind is boggling. The analysis of
  the note is printing out now.
- This is quite a large ranch you have.
- It's the same on Earth.
- That is stupid!
- Hmm. I might have mental anguish.
- I'm OK then.
- It sounds dangerous. Someone could get killed. Fry, Leela, Bender, I want you to
  go with him.
- This mission is incredibly dangerous. Someone's sure to be killed. Fry, Leela, Bender--
- Oh fuff! What's the point in remembering something? You're just going to forget
  it five seconds later.
- Your standard Bending Unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy. But Bender was different.
  Bender has a point-04% nickel impurity.
- (bashful) Oh stop!
- News everyone! Today you're going to Osiris 4 to deliver this enourmous sandstone
  block.
- No. I'm afraid the smelloscope isn't powerful enough. Bender's odour is so mild
  it's being overpowered by local sources.
- Ohh!
- Where am I?
- Oh God! I'm dead. Well, no matter. (reading) Thank you all for coming. I don't recognise
  any of you, nor can I recall why I am here. Now without further ado, a film highlighting
  Planet Express Inc.'s latest fiscal year.
- '''Cause your apartment smells like Polygrip and cat pee.'
- I move that your cat stinks and is ugly.
- I'm your man.
- Me!
- I'll ruin you like I ruined this company.
- Uh, um, uh business plan, uh, yes. I keep it here - right next to my heart.
- So long suckers!
- This isn't a business, I've always thought of it as more of a source of cheap labour.
  Like a family.
- Oh uh what? I'm awake, I'm awake!
- Cygnoids? On our block? Flying foo! They should go back where they came from.
- No.
- (shouting) Go team! Beat those no good Cygnoids! Show them they stink at a game
  they've never played before!
- Why is your number seven-eight's?
- (shouting) Go Leela!
- Yes, it's a perfect scale model of the universe's largest bottle. I put a tiny spaceship
  inside to keep it from being boring.
- Get -!  For the last time Zoidberg look with your eyes not with your claws!
- Oh God! My tract!
- Good idea!
- Zoidberg, are you coming?
- Because I don't want you touching that thing.
- Good thing I secretly installed this wormhole in the table!
- You know I'm not quite sure.  Oh dear me!
- That's right Ricardo, a ship in a bottle...! What's that...? Well hang on, I'll
  look.
- I've gathered you all here in the accusing parlour because one of you is a miniature
  ship wrecker!
- Certain clues suggest the culprit is none other than our own...Philip J. Fry!
- Oh it was a brilliant scheme but you made one fatal mistake...leaving this confession
  note.
- Then I have no choice but to charge you the full cost of the materials. $10.
- That's my robot! I own him!
- Hmm. Let me see that vial Bender.  Good Lord! According to the spectrolizer, Spargle's
  magic ingredient was...water. Ordinary water!
- Yes, ordinary water. Laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD.
- I do!
- Perhaps this movie will help us take our minds off the heat.
- You heard the good news everyone! Save the Earth, et cetera et cetera!  Bye!
- The wha? Oh Halley's Comet of course. The only sufficient source of ice cubes that
  don't have bugs in them!
- Yes there's no safer occupation than mining. Especially when you're on a snowball
  whipping through space at a million miles an hour!  Safe!
- Forget it, I'm not going! I have my reasons! Shut up all of you!
- My hip hurts! I'm in the middle of cooking a turkey! I have warranty cards to fill
  out! I'm not just making excuses! Alright I'll go!
- Wernstrom!
- Absolutely not! I won't speak! I've got nothing to hide!
- I demand the floor!
- Well nuts to me. I'm taking the stage! I know the source of the greenhouse gases.
  But in my shame I've kept it secret for 75 long years. Ohhh, it haunts my memory
  still.
- Don't do what? Don't use this memory ray so I can remember what happened back then?
- Oh dear, I've failed again.
- Ooo, ouch, stop!
- A flaming burp.
- Its not always a burp. We still have one problem though. This robot will never meet
  emission standards.
- Well...I suppose the environment can take one more for the team.
- Oh this is all my fault!
- All modern robots descend from my original smog blasting designs. And that's the
  cause of global warming today.
- Wait, surely there's a better -
- Everyone listen!
- I've devised a way to save you and to stop global warming at the same time! Granted
  you're all blasting out greenhouse gases.
- But we can use those very gases to save the planet. If you all vent your exhaust
  directly upward in one burst it should thrust the Earth further from the sun, thus
  cooling it.  By my calculations we'll need the full force of every last robot. So
  quickly, everyone point your exhaust vents straight upwards.  Now vent! Vent like
  the wind!  Harder! Harder!
- A billion robot lives are about to be extinguished! Oh the Jedi's are going to feel
  this one!
- Thank you. I deserve this!
- Why yes! One week longer to be exact.
- Why don't you try protesting? Like those native Martians. Always whining that people
  don't treat their ancestor's bones with respect.
- No, actually we've discovered Fry's dog was fast-fossilised, preserving it's cellular
  structure!
- Ah Cubert, my precious babe. I'm going to attempt to clone Fry's dog. Using the
  very same apparatus I used to clone you!  Ooo look, there's a smidge of toe still
  in here.  You see, beneath the fossil's crunchy, mineral shell, there's still a
  creamy core of dog nougat!
- Amazingly yes. In cases of rapid fossilisation, I can press this brain scan button,
  retrieving Seymour's memories at the precise instant of doggy death!
- I just need to reset the Clone-O-Mat from Human Mode to Dog Mode.
- Uh-oh, this may take a while.
- Behold once more the mighty Clone-O-Mat! Requiring such vast amounts of electricity
  that we must harness the elemental power of nature itself!  I speak of course...of
  molten lava! Deep within the Earth's core. To the sub-basement!
- Not necessarily. For the dog may yet survive.
- Indeed. You see, that fossil was made of dolomite. The tough black mineral that
  won't cop out when there's heat all about. By contrast, observe the lava's affect
  on this ice swan.  Of course, that would have melted even at room temperature. I
  just wanted to get rid of it. But had it been made of that righteous mineral dolomite,
  there's a slim chance it might have survived.
- Perhaps. For a few minutes. It's dolomite baby!
- I'm a professor! Why isn't anyone listening to me? You can't go in because you'll
  melt. The fossil only has a chance because it's made of dolomite!
- Professor! Lava! Hot!
- Very well. Let this abomination unto the Lord begin!  Interesting. It seems Seymour
  died at the ripe old age of 15.
- Indeed.
- Oh sure! Smash the smart guy's machine!
- And you Cubert. I cloned you from one of my warts and I can send you straight back
  in there.
- (shouting) What?
- I've warned you not to use those things!
- Crew, you remember Cubert?  Wonderful! And I'm sure you won't mind being their legal
  guardians for a month!
- Eh wha? Oh! This is my latest invention. A device that lets anyone sound exactly
  like me!
- I am? That's not good news at all you little...
- There is no target consumer! Only targets. Targets that will tremble as their new
  master hands down edicts in my glorious booming voice!  Now quit pestering me you
  scoundrels!
- Oh bother, what have they done now?
- Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed? That's the last straw! You boys have been underfoot
  long enough!
- (mocking) Perhaps they've constructed a teddybear hospital!
- Who's going to use a delivery service with a kicked sign? Nobody that's who!
- Phew!
- (mocking) Yes its a tremendous responsibility alright!  What if a paper were to
  land in a puddle?
- Goodness there must be 50 papers in that bundle! That's a big number, 50.
- (shouting) I'm blowing you a kiss.
- (shouting) It's closing in! You can't avoid it! It's a cheek-seeker. And...gotcha!
- Well, well, well. If it isn't our little muchkin moguls!
- That's why we need you, our loyal crew, to make Planet Express 800% more profitable.
- What?
- Folks, the situation is grim but we shall prevail, thanks to you, our crack team
  of loyal dregs!
- Yes, of course you are. Now we've got to buckle down and save Planet Express.
- Balderdash! I never agreed to that!
- Tax dodge nothing! You take one nap in a ditch in the park and they start declaring
  you this and that.
- Did I ever tell you how I used to own that ship?
- Uh, might a homeless old man have a touch more beef bourguignon? And another tequila
  slammer?  Please?
- They're so stinking talented they don't even need their fathers anymore.
- You did? Tough luck suckers!
- Why did you boys do all this?
- Damn right we are! Now come on. Let's go do a little Father/Son weaseling out of
  this.
- Now now, no need to give us the business. We'd like a word with you daddy.
- Mr Blob, our sons have come to apologise for damaging your window. They've learned
  their lesson and they want to make amends.
- Now see here. We assured our sons that you'd accept their apology.
- No one gives my son that option!
- He's coming to finish the job. Someone toss me out the window!
- I suppose.
- Uh, won't join us Mr Blob?
- 'It would seem we''ve taught our boys a lesson about life: Man or Blob, it''s whats
  inside that counts.'
- '... an extremely dangerous mission ...'
- Of course, it wouldn't be Freedom Day without the traditional Freedom Tub!
- Indeed.
- Good news everyone. You'll be delivering pain medicine to the hive mind of Nigel
  7.
- We could but we won't! It's a spaceship dammit not a prom limousine!  If anyone
  needs me I'll be in the Angry Dome.
- Even I laughed at me when I built this alien cross species genetic analyser but
  I guess I showed myself! Subjects, please enter the chamber.  Now to take a DNA
  sample.  When I pull this switch the maternifuge will spin at 10,000 RPM, seperating
  out everyone who isn't the mother....father...whatever.
- Good. Fry's ejection indicates that he is not the man-mom.  Nor is Captain Brannigan.
- Zoidberg?! What the hell were you doing in there?
- Good news anyone, the Swedish robot from pi-kea is here with the supercollider I
  ordered.
- Bad news nobody, the supercollider super-exploded. I need you to take it back and
  exchanged it for a wobbly CD rack and some of those ransid meatballs.
- I don't remember much buddy, and you're no looker!
- Yes dammit!
- Pazuzu you ungrateful gargoyle! I put you through college and this is how you repay
  me?
- Let's get this gargoyle hunt on the road. Driving gloves, driving goggles. Driving
  thong. There.
- You? A woman? I'm trying to catch a monster not find the quickest route to the mall!
  Let me just adjust the seat.
- Because we're in a hurry that's why.
- Oh it's 2:30, we can still catch the early bird dinner special.
- My wha?
- Hello Mavis! Surprised to see me back again so soon?
- I expect you'll want to see my angry crotchety grandpa discount card!
- But it's good for a lifetime.
- Well I can't keep them in my mouth. They're nuclear powered!
- Mmm! Damn good meat!
- Dear God no!
- But I like being old. I don't have to talk to my parents, no one asks me to help
  move their stuff, I don't need to understand today's "edgy TV sitcoms."
- My thong!
- Go to hell Heather!
- Give me back my floppy face!
- Careful with the giblets!
- Ahh!
- You sound just like my tennis instructor.
- Oh I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with
  a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
- Well that was an utter waste of time.
- Poodlespit!  53 years old?  Now I'll need a fake ID to rent ultra-porn.
- Dear Lord, you've all reverted to your childhood forms!
- While I try to restore our normal ages, I expect you all to go about your jobs like
  normal professionals.
- Quiet! Quiet I say!
- That's not what happened! Shut up and go live with your parents.
- I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth! Suddenly I'm going
  to the bathroom like clockwork every three hours! And those jerks at social security
  stopped sending me cheques! Now I have to pay them!
- Fine, get going!
- We won't know that until you leave.
- There's the door.
- Yes, I'd like to meet this "moose." But in the meantime I have good news. I may
  have solved our age problem.
- It seems the Youthasizer tar was saturated with time-altering chronitons. A thin
  layer is still stuck to our DNA as well as Bender's Robot DNA or "RNA."
- Yes?
- Yes yes. Anyhow I've designed an oil eating bacterium that should take the tar right
  off.
- Don't you understand you little nitwit? Unless you're treated soon, the only way
  to restore your true age would be to grow into it! Just as God intended.
- Initiating controlled infection.
- Damn! the bacteria pigged out on the tar and now they're getting freaky deaky, spreading
  chronitons throughout our systems. We're getting younger by the minute!
- Word! We'll all keep getting younger and younger until we suffer a fate worse than
  death - pre-life! Then death.
- I've got to stop this reverse aging before we all shrivel up and suffer the agony
  of unbirth. Think you disco duck think!
- Get off me you parasitic lamprey!
- Would you all chill! I can't think with you kids cramping my style! Oh I need a
  babysitter!
- The Fountain Of Aging? Hmm, it is just a legend. Still, they called the Tooth Fairy
  a legend and now it's head of the FBI.
- Sup? Kids ready?
- I had a few beers but I'm cool to drive.
- Teddybear junction, the worst scum hole in the galaxy.
- This solar system is like way old.
- Newsflash! Everything's getting older the closer we get to that sun!
- Shut up! I was gonna say that!
- We gotta be real real careful to stay in just long enough to make us our right ages
  again.
- Zoidberg! Get out of there!
- Jeepers!
- Thanks for the help Weewa. Once we're gwown up you can go back to your famiwy. We'wl
  never bother you again.
- It's working! Hooray!  I can't hold on!
- No Leela! You can't give up your childhood! You'll never have another chance at
  it!
- Even older! Huzzah!
- And you my faithful fiend! How can I ever repay you?
- Bad news everyone. You're not good enough to go on your next mission.
- Because. And says me. It's an extremely dangerous mission that killed my last crew.
  And you're not nearly as good as them.
- Collecting honey. Ordinary honey.
- This is no ordinary honey. It's produced by vicious space bees. A single sting of
  their hideous neuro-toxin can cause instant death!
- Your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano!
- These bees are larger than most Buicks and twice as ugly!
- No no no no no no no.  I'm lying to make her feel better.
- This makes me the oldest member of my family.
- Oh course he still exists. As a frozen corpse in outer space!  Oh, I made myself
  sad.
- Bullpies!
- Lay down here and we'll do some tests. If Fry is out there then Leela's brain could
  be acting as a five pound ouija board.
- Some sort yes. In France it's called a "guillotine."
- Yes. Easily.
- Well I suppose there's a slim -  I don't believe it!
- No. According to this gizmometer, Fry is dead and nothing can bring him back! Remarkable.
- No no, no one's saying that! But I'm certainly thinking it loudly.
- That's not Fry's jacket. Fry's jacket is red! That's your jacket. An off the rack
  lime green affair.
- You've been taking space honey? Be careful you purple haired imbecile!
- Incredible! According to the gizmometer, Fry touched the royal jelly in the space
  hive, leaving an imprint of his DNA and brainwaves. Then, when it spilled on the
  couch, it recombined with trace amounts of Fry's hair and skin -
- Yes Bender, thank you. In short, the various fluids Fry left in the couch caused
  the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being!
- Good news everyone, I'm still technically alive! Yes!  But I need to you to dispose
  of this crazy ass experiment that almost killed me.  You'll have to throw it into
  the sun itself, for only the thermonuclear inferno of the sun has enough energy
  to ensure its total destruction!
- That's not good enough.
- Yes yes!
- No peeking!  I don't know what's in there but I'm sure our minds would be unable
  to comprehend -
- 'I don''t care.  Listen well: No matter what happens, no matter how great your curiosity,
  you are forbidden to look in this box. Forbidden!  Pretty tantilising though!'
- Astonishing. I must have created a parallel universe!
- Ow.
- Let's recap what's happened so far. As you can see I accidentally created a box
  containing your universe.
- Wait a minute. If our universes are identical then why did our Leela look into the
  box and your Leela didn't?
- Interesting. Apparently the key difference between our universes is that coin flips
  have opposite outcomes.
- Your people and your slight differences disgust me. I'm going home. Where's that
  blue box with our universe in it?
- Nonsense! I would never do such a thing unless you would already have been going
  to do that!
- You heard me!
- And you all do the same!
- Say, I hope you won't think it "evil" of me to ask how you got that stylish head
  wound!
- Of course! I had the same idea! I flipped a coin to decide if I should proceed but
  it came up tails - so I didn't. How'd it go?
- Oh you!
- After carefully reading the scriptures, we've concluded that none of us are evil!
- Oh go on! Wait a second. If your Hermes was about to destroy the box containing
  our universe...
- Oh my!
- Right. Good thing Professor B there hid it in the sealed clam tank. No one but a
  crazy lobster would look there!
- No. We must attempt to create another box containing our universe! Doy!
- Gotcha!
- Nonsense, why there's a whole universe in there.
- Get a job! (shouting into the parabox) We've got the box. Everyone pull your wires.
- Hurry! Back to Universe A!
- Hermes don't press that button!
- Ready?
- There. That space-time inversion has given us their box and vice-versa!
- Correct! This box contains our own universe!
- Yes, all that is and ever shall be is in that box! And the box itself is probably
  worth something too. We must cherish it, as we cherish every moment of our lives.
- I'm well aware of that.
- As a man it has become too much of a chore for me to clean out my wrinkles each
  day. Is it true that stem cells may fight the aging process?
- One pound of stem cells please.
- Hey! Turn that damn music......up!
- The key is to grab life by the hojos! Live every day like it might be your last!
- One bowl of mild verena.
- Ow! Not so rough!
- Wha?  Uh, gotta go, uh fight club!
- I'm afraid the face you fell in love with was actually just a blob of living gunk
  I bought with my tax refund.
- That certainly is honest.
- You, fat as the Queen of Seacows.
- Oh my!
- We're trapped my sweet hippopotamus!
- Oh my yes!
- Oh Lord. Hiking is always such a strain on the buttocks.
- Don't tell me you actually believe in Bigfoot you blathering ninny-hammer!
- (shouting) Bunk! Bunk I say! Bring me a bag full of Bigfoot's droppings or shut
  up!
- Shut up!
- Goodnight employess.
- Fry! What in Sega Genesis happened to you?
- Which last night?
- Well there's no sense fretting. Good Lord you're ugly! The fact is your nose is
  gone and we'll never find out who did it or why.
- Oh, let's go check on Hermes. All this inspiring multi-culturalism is angrying up
  my blood.  Sweden? I don't think so!
- Don't worry, the fat pig will do fine thanks to this flabbo-dynamic spandex bodysuit
  I've designed.  It redistributes his weight, shifting his centre of gravity closer
  to his knees.
- Now that's a limboer's body!
- (shouting) Go bodysuit, go!
- Oh I think we should just stay friends.
- Bender a robot sex change is a complex and dangerous procedure. Replacing your testosteroil
  with Fembot lubricants can cause wild mood swings. And the effects may be irreversible.
  Well let's get started!
- I'm sorry ladies but I must do this. Not for you, not for Bender, but for the proud
  people of Robonia!
- (shouting) Quiet! (talking) I'm about to begin the process of reshaping Bender's
  body into a tender delicate form.
- (dramatically) Draining male oil.  Infusing female oil.  Removing item.
- Dear Lord, a coaster! The Femzoil must be sacheting girlishly into your processor.
- Oh dear. Her mood swings are getting wilder. She's becoming a slave to her emotions.
  Just like all women, particularly you Leela.
- You're falling into the final debilitating stages of womanhood. You've waited too
  long to switch back you dingbat!
- Turn off that crap-o-rama! One mistake now and Bender will be trapped forever between
  the already ill-defined robot sexes.
- Almost done.
- Sentimental drivel-poop.
- Like fun it is you glass headed wallaby!
- Werrrnstrom!
- Indeed. That's why I bought one to help around the office.
- Oh look Bender if you want something to do stop making out and give us a hand.
- Yes?
- Well then there's only one solution. You need an upgrade to make you compatible
  with Robot 1-X's new technology.
- Yes for God sakes, yes!
- (shouting) Oh! I'm blind!
- What do you mean "no power"? We're living in the future.
- That's just stupid.
- You wanged my ship you walnut panelled idiot!
- Hmm, you didn't have a birth so technically, no.  Oh, don't feel bad. We can celebrate
  the day I extracted you from the cloning tank. Or the day I scraped that DNA from
  that growth on my back.
- Ah yes. It was 13 years ago next week. I used this very fork.
- Well that doesn't mean that no one is coming and that you two are total losers.
  Who gave you that idea?
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.
- The ruffians smoked one of your cigars.
- What? Such an act would be most uncomfortable for both of us! Where did you learn
  such language?
- Good news everyone. Hermes and I have started a Bender protest group.
- And for what? Some kind of cheap laugh? That's not what F-A-R-T is all about.
- What's going on in here?  Oh. Now I'm really outraged.
- Hmm. There's something wrong with your story but I can't put my finger on it. Of
  course! You don't have friends!
- Balderdash! I'll be the judge of who's cool, using the cool-o-meter!
- Good Lord, I'm getting a reading of over 40 mega-Fonzies!
- I'll tell you what. Our boys have taken up stealing! One of the worst and coolest
  of crimes.
- Listen up Hollywood. We're an exciting new mob.
- Booya!
- There'll be no further nasty.  We still have the option of resorting to violence.
- I saw it on TV in that episode where Bender shot Calculon! How cool is that?
- Quit the show!
- I'm a cold blooded punk!
- Wha?
- I was using that!
- Uh...that we should all take TV a little less seriously. And more importantly, turn
  it off once in a while.
- Well, uh, that depends what's on.
- Ah let's just keep watching.
- Wha?
- Oh!
- (singing) We're dedicated, yes!
- (singing) It can't be real -
- (singing) I can't believe the devil is so unforgiving.
FATBOT:
- I heard that in one single night you drank a whole keg, streaked across campus and
  crammed 58 humans into a phone booth.
- Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
- This is gonna be great!
- Oh, mama!
- (screaming) They're gonna catch us!
- My mom is gonna kill me!
- When I get nervous I get hungry.
- It's my first time, I'm really nervous.
- It's like his personality is totally different now! Oh, maybe this upgrade isn't
  such a good idea.
FATHER:
- What people skills.
- And yet she's cursed to live the horrible degrading life of a mutant. Like all of
  us. Especially him!
- I made this bracelet so that in some small way, we'll always be with you, even when
  it doesn't seem like it. During your entire life, for example.
- She'll never know we're her parents.
- I'm with you.
FEMBOT:
- Whee!
- Cease hitting Femputer!
- (ashamed) It's true. I disguised myself as a Femputer so I could rule the Amazonians.
- Why? Why? I came here from a faraway planet. A planet ruled by a chauvinistic Manputer
  that was really a Manbot. Have you any idea how it feels to be a Fembot living in
  a Manbot's Manputer's world?
- And now, my meddling Manbot, there's the question of what to do with you!
- (from inside) Come back later. Leave me alone.
- (from inside) You heard the man.
- These kids yours?
- Ooh. I'm attracted to a man with responsibility!
- I guess you're busy. I'll catch you later.
- Oh, oh, Bender! Sign my chest!
FEMPUTER:
- Your gift pleases Femputer. Femputer demands to know why there are men on her planet.
- That does not fempute. Femputer will return after deciding your punishment.
- After lengthy femputations, I, Femputer, have decided the fate of the men. Femputer
  sentences them to death.  By snu-snu!
- Death to the men. Death by snu-snu.
- Hmm. Perhaps men are not as evil as Femputer thinks.
- What?! Did you explain how the women's good fundamentals make up for their inability
  to dunk?
- The men must die.
- Very well, release him. As for the others, take them to the snu-snu chambers.
- Intruder! Stay away from the mighty Femputer! Guards!
- Hey, whoa, whoa! Stop it! Stop it! Hey, cut that out!
FENDER:
- Hey, Bender!
- Not anymore, baby. I'm with the band!
- Hey, fellas, hey. I want you to meet my friends Bender, Fry and Leela.
- Don't be a drag, man. We're jacking on!  Aww yeah!  Wanna jolt?
- Come on, Bender, grab a jack. I told these guys you were cool.
- Easy, baby. You don't wanna get hooked on this stuff.
FIONA:
- The four welcomes of friendship to you as well, Leela. We shall manipulate your
  mind so we appear to be speaking your language. Do not be afraid, my child.
- Uh, good. Good.
- And even we are powerless to stop them, fearsome though we are.
- The Brain Spawn suppress intelligence by attacking the delta brain wave. Every animal
  and robot in the universe generates this wave, as do certain trees.
- Somehow he has cobbled together a random assortment of other brainwaves into a working
  mind.
- Only Fry, with is superior, yet inferior mind, can approach him. You must tell him
  to disable it. We will do the rest.
- No we can't. Once on Earth, you will be too stupid to remember the message.
- The brains are weakening.  Nibblonians to Nibble stations. Prepare cuddle bug for
  deployment in 40 nibblets.
- Oh, niggle-snoosh!
- Welcome Lord Nibbler.
- He knows not?
- The Feast Of A Thousand Beasts is begun.
- They plan to collect all the information in the universe and store it in the sphere.
- Right.
- Your mission is to infiltrate the Infosphere and plant this quantum-interphase bomb,
  blasting them into an alternate universe, from which there is no return.
FLABBY:
- My hero!
FLEXO:
- No duh dreadlock, we're both bending units.
- '3370318.'
- Well I don't feel as bad as you look! Nah I'm just messing with you kid. You're
  alright. That's some face you got though, I think they got a cream for that.  Nah,
  you're great.
- Actually your little stunt did a number on my back. You mind rubbin' it for me?
- Aw yeah, that's it. A little lower.
- Lower. Yeah that's it. A little lower though.
- I'll say, you're rubbing my ass!
- And that ain't silicon. It's tungsten - and plenty of it!
- Eww!
- Yoo-hoo!
- Yeah, how 'bout a lapdance for my pal here?
- Hey Fry, think fast.  Get it? It's chlorine!
- Oh oh Mr Professor, right here!
- That's "Flexo outranks me, sir"!
- Keeping an eye on the safe?
- Well, looks like it's my shift. You lie down and go offline for a while.
- So? I look at lots of atoms. Shouldn't you be resting up for your shift?
- Whatever it takes to shut your yapper. Nah, I'm just kidding you, you're a joker.
- Suit yourself skinbag.
- Good.
- Good.
- Good.
- Yeah eight hours of solid boredom. Nah, I'm kidding, you're a wonderful man.
- No shoot him, he's choking me!
- I saw him snatch it while Fry was asleep. That's why I ran to tell Bob Barker.
- Don't even bother. You people sicken me. I put my life on the line to guard that
  atom and this is how you repay me? Well you can go rot for all I care. Nah, I'm
  just kidding, you guys are alright.
- Wait, but I -
- Bender?
- You bastard! They treated me like an animal and that's what I became!  Nah, you're
  alright. Good to see you, buddy!
- We're just havin' dinner 'cause we wanna stay friends.
- Thanks, I appreciate that.  Nah, I'm joshing you. That was quite annoying.
- What?
- That's low!
- Yeah, never better.  Nah, I'm yankin' your chain, I'm dying.
- Thanks, buddy. Another year under that and I'd have been a goner.
FLORP:
- So what is the deal with people from under the orange sun? They're all... But us
  guys from under the red sun, we're like... Right? Am I right?
- Humorbot 5.0, ladies and gentlemen. Our next stand-up's a veteran of four comedy
  traffic schools. Give it way up for Bobcat Zoidberg!
FNOG:
- Excellent. Bill, Keith, you will go to Junior Championships. Bill, congratulate
  Keith when he regains consciousness.
- Perhaps. But there is more to winning than beating your opponent. You lack the will
  of the warrior.
- No girl has the will of a warrior. You have the will of a housewife or, at best,
  the schoolmarm.
- Very well. But, you see, I have the will of the warrior. Therefore, the battle is
  already over. The winner? Me!  Rematch? You lose again! Had enough? I thought so!
- I am Destructor's trainer, Master Fnog. My pupil will be victorious for he has the
  will of a warrior!
- 'So, we meet again. Most amusing: Girl who acts like fighter training fighter who
  acts like girl.'
- Huh?
- Better than being a girl. Like you. You're a girl!
- You were an excellent student.  Too bad I was a lousy teacher!
- See you in girl hell. I'll be in boy hell -- much nicer!
FORD:
- I apologise for his rudeness, ma'am. He gets this way around meaty-looking women.
- Frankly, I've never felt voting to be all that essential to the process.
FOREIGNER:
- I'm not from here! I have my own customs! Look at my crazy passport!
- Sales of your Bender Brand French milk bath soaps are down 20%.
FOREMAN:
- This could be the most one-sided fight since 1973 when Ali faced an 80-foot tall
  mechanical Joe Frazier. M-My memory's not what it used to be but I think the entire
  Earth was destroyed.
- It's not-not a smart bet.
- This seems like as good a time as any time to bring up my new grill for no reason.  With
  its patented design, the fat drains directly into my mouth.
- 'It sure was some fight. Interesting side note: As a head without a body, I envy
  the dead.'
- And he didn't look half bad in the tutu.
- What?
FRAKES:
- Yes! Front row!
FRANKIE:
- It's alright.
FRANKLIN:
- (on bill) A penny saved is a penny earned. Also, could you get some athlete's foot
  cream for my face?
FRED:
- Esther, you ugly!
FRY:
- And that's how you play the game!
- Michelle, baby! Where you going?
- I hate my life I hate my life I hate my life.
- Hello? Pizza delivery for......Icy Wiener?! Aw, crud! I always thought at this point
  in my life I'd be the one making the crank calls!  Here's to another lousy millennium.
- What the?
- My God! It's the future. My parents, my co-workers, my girlfriend. I'll never see
  any of them again. Yahoo!
- Cool! Just like in Star Trek!  Ow!
- Uh, Fry.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Uh...
- Sort of.
- What's with the eye?
- Cool, an alien! Has your race taken over the Earth?
- Wait a minute! Is that blimp accurate?
- My God, a million years!
- Y'know, I guess it should be but actually I'm glad. I had nothing to live for in
  my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to suspect
  my girlfriend might be cheating on me.
- That's great! What's the little guy's name?
- Eurgh!
- Y'know, I'm the luckiest guy in the whole future. I've been given a second chance
  and this time I'm not going to be a total loser.  What's that?
- Delivery boy? No! Not again! Please! Anything else!
- What if I refuse?
- Fine!
- But I don't like being a delivery boy.
- Keep that thing away from me!
- See you in a thousand years!  You owe me one.
- Whoa!
- Cool!  Um. Cross Town Express?
- Hey! A phone booth! I can call my nephew. Wow, a real live robot! Or is that some
  kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
- It doesn't look so shiny to me.
- Yeah, I'd like to place a collect call.
- Help! What's happening?
- Why would a robot need to drink?
- Really? What do you do Bender?
- You any good at it?
- What?
- Wait! You're the only friend I have!
- Yeah, ever since I was six.
- Oh, no, it's the Cyclops!  Don't look! Don't look!
- Spock? Hey! Do the thing!
- This is unbelievable! What do you heads do all day?
- Yeah, well, if you're sorry why are you doing it?
- Ow! Stoppit! Down boy! Bad president!
- Wait a second. You're a bender, right? We can get out of here if you just bend the
  bars.
- Who cares what you're programmed for. If someone programmed you to jump off a bridge
  would you do it?
- C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's what separates
  people and robots from animals...and animal robots.
- Come on, Bender! You can do it.
- Yes!
- I don't know how you did that.
- Good Lord! What is this?
- Its my old neighbourhood. Man, this brings back a lot of memories.
- This is where I brought my girlfriend on our very first date.
- My God! She's gone. Everyone I ever knew or cared about is gone.
- Oh, can't you leave me alone? I'm miserable enough already.
- No, you don't. I've got no home, no family...
- '...My whole world is gone. You can''t possibly understand what it feels like to
  be so alone.'
- Look, Leela, I don't understand this world but you obviously do, so I give up. If
  you really think I should be a delivery boy, I'll do it.  Your chip. What are you
  doing?
- Why?
- What is the matter with you?
- Correction. We're unemployed but we have a doddering old relative to mooch off of.
- I'm your dear old Uncle Fry.
- Whoa! A real live spaceship!
- No!
- I'll get us out of here.
- Blast-off!
- So I guess without jobs, we'll be fugitives forever.
- Yes! Yes! That's exactly the job I've always wanted!
- This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and teaching alien
  women to lurve?
- Cool! What's my job gonna be?
- So, I'm gonna be a delivery boy?
- Alright! I'm a delivery boy!
- Wow!
- Are there really giant birds like that?
- I'm never going to get used to the 31st century.  Caffinated bacon? Baconated grapefruit?
  Admiral Crunch?
- Hi -- eurgh!
- I only have one.
- Uh, is there a human doctor around?
- Well, the doctor says I'm as healthy as a crab. Can I go into space now?
- (chuffed) Last time I checked.
- Finally! Come on Bender, let's mosey!
- So where are we going anyway?
- The moon? The moon moon? Wow! I'm gonna be a famous hero just like Neil Armstrong
  and those other brave guys no one ever heard of!
- Can I do the countdown?
- Ten......nine --
- Hurry up, I wanna see the moon!
- That's one small step for Fry --
- Wow!  Um, can I have cuts?
- You're not gonna believe this but they landed an amusement park on the moon!
- Lets go, already!
- Let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
- I had more but you go ahead.
- But I've never been to the moon before.
- Clear!
- Ready!
- My first space delivery.
- Uh, greetings, Moon Man, we come in peace. I am Fry from the planet Earth.
- But you are lazy, right?
- Hey, I got you guys refrigerator magnets.
- So you flip out and start acting like some crazy folk singer?
- This is weak!
- I don't know. This place is great and all but its just so artificial. The gravity,
  the air, the gophers. You might as well stay on Earth.  That's what I came to see!
  I wanna go out there and jump around like an astronaut. Screw this phoney stuff!
- I don't care how educational it is. Let's do it!
- Finally! Get ready for some serious moon action.
- That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian. And he was just using space travel
  as a metaphor for beating his wife.
- I do.
- That's not how it happened.
- This is stupid. I'm taking this thing out to the real moon.
- Not for long!
- Agreed.  Yee-haw! Woo! Yeah! Crank up the radio!
- Yee-haw!
- No not yet. How 'bout we go look for the original moon landing site?
- Well I'm feelin' lucky!  Uh... I'm ready to go back now.
- We're gonna die! It's every man for himself!  Help me, Leela!  You did it! We're
  safe!
- It's every man for himself.
- (gasping) I'm sorry, Leela, I can't go on any further. Just leave me to die in that
  barn over there.
- No, sir. We're amusement park patrons.
- I guess we could do chores for a few hours.
- Fahrenheit or Celsius?
- Robot daughters?
- Whoa!
- And it was great! We got to see craters and rocks and that one incredible rock that
  looked like a crater and, and these fellas.
- I guess I can't.
- Oh, Bender. You didn't touch the Crushinator, did you?
- It's too low.
- Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!
- Over there! Look! It's the moon landing site! We found it!
- It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's footprint!  Hey! My foot's bigger!
  Leela, isn't this the greatest thing you've ever seen?
- Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should have dragged you out here.
- I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon
  and dream about being an astronaut. I just didn't have the grades. Nor the physical
  endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.
- The moon was like this awesome, romantic, mysterious thing, hanging up there in
  the sky where you could never reach it, no matter how much you wanted to. But you're
  right. Once you're actually here it's just a big dull rock. I guess I just wanted
  you to see it through my eyes, the way I used to.
- It's Amy! We're saved!
- Well, close enough!
- I'm sorry. I was up really late poking through people's desks.
- And great lift!
- Hey, when you look this good, you don't have to know anything.
- Hey, Professor, great jerky!
- Sheesh! 40,000 channels and only 150 have anything good on.
- Hmm, must be a friend of theirs.
- I know but I forgive you.
- Uh-huh.
- Right.
- Leela! We're trying to watch TV.
- So, who's that weird-looking guy?
- What's he do?
- Boring!
- Hey, uh, why is the TV getting smaller?
- It looked good but I just don't feel like eating. You want it?
- What are the cigars for?
- I can't believe they threw me out like that. I must have been really acting like
  a jerk.
- I don't know. Do refrigerators still come in cardboard boxes?
- Really? That'd be great! You sure I won't be imposing?
- Cool! Y'know, I've never even seen a robot's apartment before.
- It's kinda cramped in here. I don't even have room to hang my clothes.
- Wait, Bender. Bender?
- Bender, wake up!
- Uh, listen, Bender, uh, where's your bathroom?
- Bathroom.
- Bathroom!
- Ah, never mind!
- Oh, it's Bender's apartment. He put in carpeting yesterday so now my head hits the
  ceiling. Hey, do you realise you're standing at a weird angle?  Now you're OK.
- (sexily) Is that an invitation?
- Yeah, but he might get kind of upset. I don't think I can do that to him.
- Well, I'm moving out!
- I'm sorry, Bender, but there's just not enough room.
- Hmm, I'm not sure we want to pay for a dimension we're not going to use.
- Well, I give up. What's the catch?
- Not one place even remotely liveable.
- 'Well, this place has everything except the only thing I care about: A TV.'
- Ooh!
- Man, it's a total sty! For the first time in a thousand years, I feel like I'm home.
- Ooh!  Hey, Amy!
- Hey, hang on, All My Circuits is about to start!
- Hey!
- Shh, the wedding's about to start!
- Is he objecting or backing up?
- It just went out.
- (shouting) Come back, Bender, its working!
- It's out again.
- It's back on!
- It's tempting, but, well, I am already kinda settled in here.
- Uh, listen, is there maybe some way we could do this with you going and me not going?
- Well, you were gonna live in the closet anyway. Won't you be just as happy back
  in your old place?
- I'll come visit sometime. And you can visit me here.
- Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This way we'll both be happy.
- Hey, thanks for coming.
- Ah, come on. Bender loves mobs.
- Don't girl me with that girl stuff. Bender and me are guys. Guys don't have feelings.
- Same thing.
- What up?
- Silent? You've been meddling for two solid weeks.
- Really? I didn't think he'd miss this apartment that much.
- Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew where he was I'd go talk to him.
- Oh, stupid TV!  Bender! You're blind stinking sober!
- Don't do it!
- Cutting Leela's head off won't solve anything!
- Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give you a hand?
- But it's a useless antenna. It's not like he's a ham radio or something.
- Hey, it works! The static's gone.
- She's right.
- Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.
- What's wrong?
- Aww, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, if we found your antenna could they still
  reattach it?
- It's good to be home.
- So that's where those skin flakes went. Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's going
  to get enough light?
- This is huge! Bender, why don't I just live in here?
- What was wrong with your date last night?
- Yeah. If you rule out every guy with a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an explosive
  violent temper, of course you're gonna be lonely.
- Why's everyone wearing those rings?
- I think they look cool.
- No way! We've got so much in common.
- Uh, yeah! That rings a bell.
- Psst, I need the apartment tonight. Go see a saucy puppet show.
- A delivery?
- I bet you Leela's holding out for a nice guy with one eye.
- Yeah, that'd be a timesaver.
- Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?
- Who's the Zapp Brannigan?
- Wow!
- (teasing) Leela's got a boyfriend!
- I heard that one time you single-handedly defeated a horde of rampaging somethings
  in the something something system.
- Wow! I never would have thought of that!
- What just happened?
- Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?
- We can definitely escape, Bender. All you have to do is bend the hatch off this
  steam pipe.
- No good! It's full of steam!
- You wanna try escaping again?
- Man, Leela's been gone a long time. I hope she's at least making progress with Zapp
  Brannigan.
- Really? Why?
- What does that mean?
- Yeah, a barbecue! I'll wear my hilarious apron.
- Where'd they all go?
- I can't believe we flew halfway across the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just to get
  lunch for that stupid animal!
- The planet's kerploding!
- Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby.
- What? What are you talking about?
- How could you, Leela? I thought you had some standards. I mean, jeez, he's a dumb,
  gross gorilla!
- No!
- Wow, way to tell that guy off. Now what's your secret escape plan?
- Pew!
- We're heroes!
- It really puts things in perspective. I mean, from up here an entire world can seem
  utterly insignificant.
- I don't get this. Is blernsball exactly the same as baseball?
- Boring? Baseball wasn't -- hmm, so they finally jazzed it up?
- Home run! Ha ha! Yay! Right?
- What just happened? Why is the ball on that springy thing?
- Mmm, at least hotdogs haven't changed.
- Me!
- Hey, I'm starting to get the hang of this game. The blerns are loaded, the count's
  three blerns and two anti-blerns and the infield blern rule is in effect, right?
- What are you talking about? There's all kinds of robots down there.
- 11?
- What's wrong?
- Well, aren't they?
- Why is that great news?
- Really? Which one?
- Man, that one was a blast!
- 'So let me get this straight: This planet is completely uninhabited?'
- Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes.
- Yeah, but I guess I'd be kinda angry too if I had to go to some uninhabited planet.
- Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery.
- Oh, my God! We have to go down and rescue him.
- W-what are we gonna do?
- (mechanical voice) I am fully operational, captain.
- I can sorta dance like a robot. Will that help?
- Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten store-bought costumes.
- Uh, yup! Just two robots out roboting it up!  Eh?
- (whispering) C!  (talking) Is the puppy mechanical in any way?
- I can't. I have to go to the bathroom.
- Oh, right. I wonder where they smoke in high school.
- Uh...
- I think the leak's stopping itself. Wait. Wait. Yeah, there we go. Wait. Yeah!
- Wow, the 3-D's great!
- God help us!
- Umm, too much romance, not enough human killing.
- I'm over here.
- It's him! He's OK!
- Ahh! It's good to hear his voice!
- My God! He's become evil.  I mean eviler!
- Psst! Bender!
- We've been looking for you. Last we heard you were under arrest as a human sympathiser.
- We're rescuing you.
- Say what?
- But, Bender, we're your friends.
- That's not true.
- Bye, Bender. I'll miss you.
- Hey, wait a minute! Isn't anyone going to defend us?
- Call technical support.
- No!
- Oh, yeah.
- You don't look very old.
- But the judge already sentenced us at the trial!
- Damn right!
- Stop! Take one more step and I'll breathe fire on you!
- So long, suckers!  Uh, hello, suckers!
- We wanted to show you that we really do respect your robot heritage.
- But that doesn't make it any less meaningful.
- I can't take it anymore! They've been at it for hours!  (shouting) Give it a rest,
  you two!
- Uh, excuse me? I missed a few lectures. Uh, what subject is this?
- What a nightmare!
- What a weird dream! I'll never get back to sleep.
- So you're telling me they broadcast commercials into people's dreams?
- But, how is that possible?
- That's awful. It's like brainwashing.
- Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only on TV and radio. And in magazines and movies
  and at ball games and on buses and milk cartons and t-shirts and written in the
  sky. But not in dreams. No siree!
- Cool.  Can I try these on before I buy them?
- ': Ooh! Ho ho ho!'
- $30? I can't afford that. Unless... Do you take Visa?
- American Express?
- Discover card?
- No, I can't afford them. Being poor sucks. What kind of world is this where they
  advertise things not everybody can afford?
- Hey who's the rocker jockey?
- Hey, Bender. Sounds like you could use a little of that oil.
- 78, 79. 79.50. Crud! We're 50 cents short.
- Hey, that's my old bank. Maybe my account's still open.
- Yeah, well, I did open the account over a thousand years ago. What about my ATM
  card?
- Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work,
  Panucci's Pizza.
- Alright!
- Pizza dinner on me!  Just keep the tab under $50 million.
- Uh, yeah. We'll have one with everything but anchovies and one with my all time
  favourite topping, anchovies!
- Anchovies? You know? Those little headless fish?
- What?!
- So none of you has ever had anchovies? Oh, man! You don't know what you're missing.
  They were all salty and oily and they melted in your mouth and --
- I just wished I could've showed you guys how great they were. I may be rich but
  I still can't buy back all the things I miss from the 20th century.
- So? What do you think?
- What's wrong with it?
- Yes!
- I have an idea for a sitcom.
- Anchovies?!
- 15,000!
- 50,000!
- Don't tell me how to spend my money.
- 100,000.
- 500!
- Two.
- 14!
- One jillion dollars.
- Oh. In that case, 50 million.
- Now for some good old 20th century TV.
- Ah, those were the days.
- Eh?
- I've been sitting right here. I picked up my life exactly where I left off a thousand
  years ago. Now if you'll excuse me it's 8 o'clock. Time to get biz-ay!
- I could if you hadn't turned on the lights and shut off the stereo.
- I'm rich! I can live whenever I want.
- 'Junk? Maybe you can''t understand this but I''ve finally found what I need to be
  happy, and it''s not friends: It''s things.'
- Just leave me alone.
- I don't need them. Not when I have my antique videos, my bucket of fossilised KFC
  and 50 million dollars worth of anchovies.
- I didn't order any --
- Where am I?
- That sounds like me but, I thought I got frozen. Wasn't I in the future?
- So I'm really back? That's exactly what I wanted, I guess. Who are you?
- You are? Did you grow a moustache since last night?
- Hey, look! Anchovies!
- Ooh!
- Uh...
- Wait. You're Pamela Anderson! Cool! What can I get you?
- Uh, cheese and a --  That was quick!
- 10.77. Same as my PIN number.
- Oh, I had a nightmare I was in the year 2000 and you guys never existed. I'm so
  glad I'm awake now and you're really here.
- No, that's not true!
- Bender! Leela! Don't leave me. Wait a minute! Hey, buddy what year is this?
- 3000? Yes! I'm still in the future! Life is wonderful!  Wait! What are you doing
  with my stuff?
- Oh, no, my ATM card! My secret PIN number! 1077. I've got nothing left. Except...
- Leela! Bender! I missed you so much!
- I was robbed. They got everything except these.
- Sorry. But the anchovies aren't for sale.
- You might as well put that chequebook away, because I've discovered something even
  more important. My friends. And they aren't worth even a penny to me. That's why
  these anchovies are going on a pizza, so I can share the food I love with the people
  I like.
- What a nice lady!
- OK, my friends. Get ready for the most delicious extinct animal you've ever tasted.
- Ah, no one likes them at first but they'll grow on you.
- There aren't any more. And there never will be.
- Hey, what you watching?
- Its OK, Bender, I like cooking too.
- You're gonna be the ship's cook?
- Bam!
- So this is Little Neptune?
- Ooh! What's this?
- Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.
- Hmm, I can see where that would be an advantage. Do you take cash?
- I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew up in this city. These are my people. What up?
- See?
- Wow! You guys sell every kind of meat here except human!
- Now that you mention it, I do have trouble breathing underwater sometimes. I'll
  take the gills.
- Can't imagine why I would.
- I'm capable of making my own decisions, Leela. Did you ever stop to think I might
  be happier with gills?
- (shouting) Hey Bender how's dinner coming?
- Yeah, OK.
- That's the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. And I once a big heaping bowl of salt!
- My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna die.
- Ow!
- Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering things before you were born! I think I
  know what I'm doing.
- Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty. Oh, come on! Go down already!  Ah!
- Hello? Anybody home?
- No! It wasn't me!
- I didn't mean to. He just looked so cool and refreshing.
- It could have been. But chances were equally good it was an Emperor.
- You might.
- I gotta go with Bender.
- Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better check with my Prime Minister.
- Hey, thanks!  Wow! This got here just in time.
- Umm, how about that one?
- On second thought, I'll take that one.
- You don't have to beat around the bush, Leela, we all know who you're talking about...uh,
  me, right?
- There won't be a lot of long-winded speeches, will there?
- Will there be cake?
- There you go.
- Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!
- So?
- 80,000 years?
- Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really low.
- Well at least my assassin will get what's coming to him.
- Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis myself.
- Yeah, I was going to thumb through that later.
- Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't even
  be here in the year 3000. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus.
  All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched
  off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came and the grasshopper
  died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar. Is any of this
  getting through to you?
- Who asked you to? I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like a baby. Now
  go. Go gather your nuts you nagging grasshopper.
- I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's gonna drink me.  Quit it!
- What up?
- Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, who drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled
  Zorn the Stagnant...
- '...who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed a soup composed principally of Throm
  the Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule with honour and insanity - uh, integrity!'
- My tummy hurts!
- Ow!
- What am I gonna do?
- But won't that crush my bones?
- I could vomit or urinate. Would you feel better about that?
- That's a great idea! Crying.
- It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just too macho.
- What do you mean? I was Emperor of a whole planet.
- These things happen.
- Phew! That's a load off my mind.
- She'll never help me. She's still mad that I told her never to help me.
- What the hell is that?
- This is the saddest day of my life. And I still can't cry.
- I can't believe it. She's risking her life for me after the way I treated her. I
  don't deserve this. I feel terrible.
- Is she alright?
- No. No!
- This can't be happening.
- All Leela ever wanted to do was help me. But I was to proud, too stupid to accept
  it.  I wish I had died instead of her.
- Leela! You're alive!
- Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take all the help you're willing to give. I know
  you just want what's best for me.  Ow! What was that for?  Hey, come on!  That hurt!
- (crying) Oh, now I understand.
- (crying) Thanks, everybody. I love you all. You guys are true -- ow! Cut it out,
  Bender! That's a tender area!
- Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?
- Oh, you're welcome.
- Wow! I love symposia.
- Sounds like fun. How long do I have left to live?
- Who's the gross nerd?
- Who's that jerk?
- Don't worry, Professor, it's no competition for your death clock.
- No, Professor, don't give up. There were plenty of times in my century when I was
  gonna give up but I never did. Never! Hey, are you even listening to me? Oh, I give
  up!
- Did you build the Smellescope?
- Smells like strawberries.
- Pine needles. Oh, man, this is great! Hey, as long as you don't make me smell Uranus.
- Oh. What's it called now?
- No, no, I think I'll just smell around a bit over here!  Hmm.  Hmm.
- So this thing's gonna destroy the whole city?  What the heck is it?
- Wow! You got that off the Internet? In my day the Internet was only used to download
  pornography.
- Hey, hey, gimmie a break! What do you do with it?
- The future is disgusting.
- Hey! You have no right to criticise the 20th century. We gave the world the lightbulb,
  the steamboat and the cotton gin.
- Yeah, well, they probably just copied us.
- Hmm, sporty!
- Wow!
- It's not filth. It's a glorious monument to the achievements of the 20th century.
  Look! A real Beanie Baby.  Oh! A Mr. Spock collector's plate!  Some Bart Simpson
  dolls!
- This junk isn't garbage! I can dig in any random pile and find something great.
- (gasping) Alright, let's get to work.
- We're gonna die! (calmly) Right?
- We're saved!
- No, it's my fault too. I'm sure I threw out more than my share of that trash up
  there. Also, one month my toilet broke and it just went straight in the garbage
  can.  Leela was right. The people of the 20th century were idiotic slobs. Especially
  me.
- Uh, what about garbage?
- Then it's time to make some more.
- Stand back and watch the master! This Slurm can.  Now it's garbage. These papers.  Garbage.
  This picture of your wife.  Pure garbage. Now you try it.
- Good!  Don't finish that cruller, throw it away  Bender. Drink that beer and drop
  the bottle on the ground.  Very nice.
- People of New New York. Take a lesson from the 20th century. Stop all this pain-in-the-ass
  recycling and throw your garbage on the floor.
- Go ahead. Just chuck it any old place like I used to. Your city is counting on you.
- Oops!
- It worked!
- Who cares? That won't be for hundreds of years.
- That's the 20th century spirit!
- This is awesome! I've been waiting a thousand years to see a Beastie Boys show.
- Sure!
- Will you guys shut up! I'm trying to look cool.
- Wow! An old-fashioned mosh pit! Come on guys. Tonight we're gonna party like its
  1999...again.
- Man, these guys rock harder than ever!
- Wow! I love you guys! Back in the 20th century, I had all five of your albums.
- Cool! Can I borrow the new ones? And a couple of blank tapes?
- Hey uh Bender. What are we doing in this bad neighbourhood?
- Who was that guy?
- Bender? No way!  I definitely would've noticed something.
- I know Big Vinnie said he was giving me the kiss of death but I still think he was
  gay.
- A little.  You OK, Bender?
- What's happening? I-I feel weird!
- And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you. Just like when my friend Richie
  swore he wasn't taking drugs and then he sold me my mom's VCR and then later I found
  out he was taking drugs. You make me ashamed to be your friend.
- Great he's whacked out on electricity again.
- Religon? Is this another scam to get free yarmulkes?
- Does that mean we can eat now?
- Oh, uh, but I don't want to.
- Bender's stupid religion is driving me nuts.
- We've got to get the old Bender back.
- Uh, this.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long as we're here why don't we take in some,
  exotic dancing!
- Come on, it'll be fun! Maybe we could even drink a little fortified wine.
- And there's Hookerbot 5000. She's got a heart of solid gold!
- Pfft, that's for losers. C'mon, sin your heart out.
- Go for it, Bender. You know you wanna!
- Look's like we got the old Bender back!
- Well he didn't check out. The ashtray's still here.  Look, Nibbler's caught the
  scent of vodka and motor oil! Go, boy. Follow that stench.
- Wait! I remember this place. They shut it down after all those people caught salmonella
  from the flume ride.
- Unbelievable. It's an actual, factual Robot Hell.
- Actually --
- (singing) I don't feel well.
- (singing) Maybe he likes it here in hell.
- (singing) Maybe he's back at the motel.
- (singing) My ass has blisters from the slide.
- Bender, are you alright?
- Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds of pounds and sound crummy?
- (whispering) No, do you?
- Run!
- Good old Bender! THE END
- Yeah. I'm never going to another planet called Cannibalon!
- This is great! I haven't had time off since I was 21 through 24.
- Hey, uh, where's my suitcase?  Ow!
- Huh?  Ooh! How do you do?
- Man, first class seems nice!
- Well at least we get a window!
- "I guess that just leaves you and your fake fianc\xE9 ... all alone ... on a romatic\
  \ cruise."
- OK!
- Yeah, it's pretty romantic-- Uh, I mean platonic. Th-That sure is one platonic view!
- Hmm? Mmmm!
- Well, you got anything else for him?
- Hmm? Mmmm!
- See you later, wuvvums!
- I'm not going out with Amy. It's just to fool her parents. Hey, you're not jealous,
  are you?
- Good, 'cause I consider my fake relationship with you a lot more meaningful.
- Go, Professor!
- Thank you, sir.
- Well, rest assured, Leela's the only girl for me.
- (whispering) Sure I can. I learned how to handle delicate social situations from
  a little show called Three's Company.
- Um, let me think. Come and knock on our door, nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh. Uh, Mr Roper--
- Uh ...
- Ah, now there's something we can all enjoy.
- Hey, Leela, why'd you run off from dinner?
- Oh, look, I'm not actually interested in her if that's what's bothering you.
- I know, we seem like a perfect match, but I just don't feel that way about her.
- Yeah.
- And me.
- Talk about a mood killer!
- You're going back or the Countess, aren't you?
- I'll tell them you went out prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.
- Then we're dead meat. No one could squeeze under there!
- Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see it I'll think back to that moment when we
  almost--  Never mind!
- Goodbye, Bender.
- Look!
- Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows what happens in a black hole. It's possible
  she's still alive in another dimension somewhere. Right, Professor?
- Who's it going to?
- Is it dangerous?
- Very impressive. Back in the 20th century we had no idea there was a university
  on Mars.
- Does that mean it's safe to breathe the air?
- What was your minor?
- I tell you, being here really takes me back to my college days.
- Good old Coney Island College! Go Whitefish!
- Oh, yeah?  Read it and weep. I'm a certified college dropout.
- What?! That's not fair. I deserve the same respect any other college dropout gets.
  By God, I'm gonna enroll here at Mars University and drop out all over again!
- Aww, thanks for believing in me.
- Oh, I don't know.  Hey, Professor, what are you teaching this semester?
- Mathematics of wanton burrito meals. I'll be there!
- See you in class!
- Hey, pretty nice for a single. Two desks, two chairs, a couple of beds.  A woodpecker.
- Oh, right, cool. (shouting) C'mon in, roomie!  (talking) What the--?
- My roommate's a monkey?
- You know each other?
- Is he genetically engineered?
- I understood the word "hat"!
- You want a banana?
- I don't like you.
- This is gonna be a cakewalk!
- Swish!
- I'm from the 20th century. Go ahead, ask me anything.
- Ooh ... I know this ... whatyya call it? Lite Brite!
- So, Chrissy, we seem to be hitting it off. If you're not doing anything later might
  I escort you to a kegger?
- Sorry, I overslept.
- It's that obnoxious monkey. He kept me up all night with his constant thinking.
  Just thinking and thinking. He's trying to make me look like an idiot.
- I hate that rodent!
- That'll show him.
- Now these monkeys I like!  What's that? You wanna come out?
- Hey, uh, Guenter? Why don't you get up on the chandelier with your parents and I'll
  take a picture?
- You mean peer pressure?
- Look out! He's got a gun!
- Hey, hey, cheer up. Not everyone turns out like their parents. I mean, look at me.
  My folks were honest hardworking people.
- Look, Guenter, if you're so miserable here, maybe you should just go back to the
  jungle.
- Thanks, Professor!
- (screaming) Ow!
- I guess he realised I was right when I told him to go back to the jungle.
- Hey, don't blame me. You tried to force Guenter to be a human but he's an animal.
  He belongs in the wild. Or in the circus on one of those tiny tricycles. Now that's
  entertainment.
- Wow" The jungles on Mars look just like the jungles on Earth.
- There's our man!
- No, the banana, the banana!
- Banana, banana, banana!
- No.
- '''Preciate it Guenter!'
- Guenter! You're alive!
- Pizza delivery! Wow, so this is a real TV station, huh?
- What are you showing right now?
- Ah, I dunno. That's a chick show. I prefer programmes of the genre "world's blankiest
  blank".
- I'm in!
- Pfft! Like anyone on Earth cares.
- Ow! Hey, quit it, Hermes. It's Labor Day.
- That's the one.
- (unenthusiastic) Eh, I think I'll just stay here.
- But this is HDTV. It's got better resolution than the real world!
- Not covered!
- Wait, Mount Rushmore and the Leaning Tower of Pisa? I didn't know they were both
  in New York!
- Ah, just like my dad used to make ... until McDonald's fired him.
- It's OK, Leela, go ahead. I got a lot of work to do.
- 50 bucks?! Not even if she was my girlfriend. You take her.
- Voila. The greatest sandcastle ever built. This is the kind of castle King Arthur
  would have lived in -- If he were a fiddler crab.
- Ooh, yeah. Anyone have a camera?
- (screaming) Nooo!
- We're all gonna die, aren't we?
- A what?
- You mean while I'm sleeping in it?
- W-Wouldn't it make more sense to send the robots in first a--
- I'm gonna be a science-fiction hero, just like Uhura, or Captain Janeway, or Xena!
- Sure, I just like TV better.
- Alright, scumwads. This one's for Bender's cocktail!
- Miniskirts? That sounds familiar.
- Wait, I know her.
- That's where I know her from. She's Jenny McNeal. She was a character on a TV show
  back in the 20th century, Single Female Lawyer.
- It's crazy! How could they even know about a show from a thousand years ago?
- Magic. Got it.
- Beer -- I would think.
- Y'know, I saw the first 30 seconds of that episode. If I could make up an ending,
  maybe we could act it out ourselves.
- Let's put on a show.
- OK, Leela, you'll be starring as Jenny--
- Places, everyone.
- Lights!  Camera one!  Camera two!  Camera three!
- Well, it took an hour to write. I thought it would take an hour to read.
- I don't know, I don't know. Just say anything. As long as it's compelling, mesmerising,
  a tour de force.
- No, no! Go to commercial!
- Married? Jenny can't get married.
- But that's not why people watch TV. Clever things make people feel stupid, and unexpected
  things make them feel scared.
- You see? TV audiences don't want anything original. They wanna see the same thing
  they've seen a thousand times before.
- Trust me on this. While other people were out living their lives, I wasted mine
  watching TV, because deep down I knew it might one day help me save the world. Plus,
  I would have lost my Workman's Comp if I hadd gone outside. Now just read these
  cue cards.
- And action!
- And ... cut!
- Way to overact ,Zoidberg!
- Yep.  It was just a matter of knowing the secret of all TV shows; At the end of
  the episode, everything's always right back to normal.
- I like those odds.  Rats. Just another tooth.  Aah!
- I gotta find that golden bottle-cap.
- This is nothing. Back in high school I used to drink a hundred cans of cola a week.
  Right up until my third heart attack.
- I'm not Bender, I'm Fry.
- Nope. Human.
- I 'unno. Try it on me.  Ow! My sperm!
- Huh, didn't hurt that time.
- What's wrong?
- All this prolonged exposure to radiation is making me thirsty.  Ah, if only there
  was some way of knowing which can had the winning bottle-cap inside.
- Wait a second. I'm getting an idea. N-No, false alarm. No. Yeah. No. Yeah. No. Wait.
  No. Yeah. Yeah. No ... no. Yes!
- We checked 90,000 cans of Slurm and all we won was this junk.  I never wanna see
  another can of Slurm again. Man, am I thirsty.
- (wheezy) Hooray!
- Uh-huh. Can we have our free Slurm now?
- So, what's the secret ingredient?
- Oh. But what is it really?
- Why?
- So thirsty.
- Uh, could I have some Slurm, please?
- When will that be?
- That's not soon enough.
- I'm dying of thirst. Grab my feet and dunk my head in so I can drink.
- Fine. I'll let go and swim around in the Slurm and drink as much as I want. Help!
  I can't swim!
- This isn't Slurm at all!
- My God. What if the secret ingredient ... is people?
- Oh. How is it?
- Look! Slurm! Finally!  Oh, yeah! I'm never going 12 minutes without a Slurm again.
- Well, whatever it is, it's even better fresh.  Mmm, still warm.
- Ew!
- That's the secret ingredient of Slurm?
- Ew!
- Thanks, Bender!
- Who's behind does that come from?
- What about me?
- Yes!
- Mmm!
- Here I come.  Let me just-- One more taste.
- I can't stop eating this delicious ooze. But I'm not gonna let you die.
- (screaming) Nooo!  (talking) I could fit if I didn't have these damn arms!
- Say what?
- But she'll crush you like a worm ... crushing a smaller worm.
- Outlaw Slurm?  Uh, don't pay any attention to him sir ...
- '... Grandpa''s making up crazy stories again.'
- Ah, I just wish Slurms MacKenzie were here to enjoy this with me.
- (simultaneously) For Slurms!
- Mmm!
- Is it me?
- You alright, Bender?
- Hey, what are these rings in Nibbler's fang?
- Yeah, well, good luck. It'd take some kind of genius to count all those rings.
- Who's playing pin the tail on the moon maggot?
- (singing) ... and you smell like one too!
- Uh-oh. Is this gonna be another crazy experiment that crosses a line Man was not
  meant to cross?
- And that'll allow Bender to feel other people's emotions?
- (whispering) Thanks for covering.
- What's your problem?
- You do?
- What?
- (crying) They're just responding to my personality.
- (shouting) The spoon's in the foot powder.
- Too bad he wasn't an alligator. Y'know, when you flush those things they stay alive
  in the sewers.
- Yep. My friend's cousin's caseworker saw one once. It's a widely-believed fact.
- Bender? Bender?!
- Have you seen my sombrero?
- Hey, it's your fault. He only flushed himself because your emotions made him feel
  bad.
- Oh, great, now you're making him feel worse!
- God bless America.
- Phew! Uh, ladies first.
- Oh, and the aftertaste!
- I burned my finger.
- 'Looks like we''re under Park Avenue. Ooh, ritzy! Just think: All this was probably
  once a charity luncheon for the Met.'
- Eck! This emotional display is making me nauseous.  Or maybe it's whatever that
  is.
- Hmm. According to this map, the only way out is through ... that pipe.  Don't worry.
  It gets wider after about a mile.
- OK, OK, nevermind. I'll just ask those people for directions.
- I'll take care of this!  Back! Back!
- Hey, aren't you supposed to be eating our brains? You're mutants.
- Daylight and everything.
- Wow. You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb?
- So, is it true that alligators flushed down the toilet survive down here?
- I'll take care of this.
- Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted straight to Bender. If you care about
  Nibbler, stop caring about him!
- Even me?
- Damn.
- Bender's gonna be killed!
- (cheering) Yeah!
- Looks like Bender learned an important lesson about respecting other people's feelings
  afterall.
- Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six.  Check.
- (hoarse) Good move.
- Sorry.
- DOOP? What's that?
- Uh...
- (getting it) Oh!
- Wow! There's a million aliens. I've never seen anything so mind blowing. Ooh, a
  reception table with muffins!
- So, what's it like on planet Amazonia?
- That's so interesting. Maybe we could get to know each other over a coffee.
- Hey, Bender?
- You don't have to get so mad, Leela.
- She's really strict.
- No, she just makes us do work and stuff.
- Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect me.
- Yeah!
- Alright, don't get your panties in a knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly.
- I agree.
- Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off.
- Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up dolly, we could have broken it, given up
  and gone home by now.
- Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish she didn't make us work so much.
- Underpants?
- This is a mutiny.
- All hail the new captain.
- We don't have a brig.
- You were mean and you yelled and you made us do all that work.
- Yeah, well, you shouldn't have been such a mean captain then.
- Ten hundred percent!
- Ooh, burn!
- This is awesome! We're gonna be like pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna be like ...  ...
  and then we'll have pancakes to celebrate and I'll be like...
- Good, good, then what?
- Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill us?
- Leela, we want you to be captain again.
- We want Leela to be captain again.
- Absolutely.
- And warm.
- It's too low.
- And no one will have to punish anyone for the mutiny.
- Leela, I just want you to know that even though you're mean, you're the best captain
  ever.
- Please?
- Aw, man.
- What do we care? We live in the United States.
- Wow! I have been gone a long time.
- These are the candidates? They sound like clones.  Wait a minute. They are clones!
- If I were registered to vote, I send these clowns a message by staying home on election
  day and dressing up like a clown.
- Nope. Not vaccinated either! Besides. It's not like one vote ever made a difference.
- Professor, when did you become so obsessed with voting?
- The less fortunate get all the breaks!
- What party do you belong to, Bender?
- '''Cause you''re a robot?'
- OK, but what are the Brain Slugs who control you gonna do for the working man?
- (sarcastic) Sure, you say that now!
- Now here's a party I can get excited about. Sign me up!
- (downbeat) OK then, screw it.
- (excited) Alright!
- That was pretty cool. I think I'm actually starting to get interested in politics.
- Too bad you can't spend it.
- No.
- Yeah, you look different. Did you get a haircut?
- This is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna live without a body?
- Well, at least now you can pay off your loan shark.
- Hey, Bender, can I take a ride in your car?
- Hey! You look me in the shins and say that.
- I recognise you. Didn't you used to have a body of some sort?
- Well, you're looking great.
- Couldn't hurt.
- (to Clinton) Hey, I remember you. I was gonna vote for you one time. But voting
  isn't cool so I stayed home alone and got trashed on Listerine.
- I hear that. I spent most of my teen years loving my body. Course, it was tough
  love but -- ooh!
- Bender, what is it?
- It was just a dream, Bender. There's no such thing as two.
- Hey, my clothes are worth 50 bucks!
- Ah, I can't stand to see a robot cry. Let's watch TV!
- Yeah, and that electric guitar.
- Please, Mr. Nixon. We're appealing to your sense of decency.
- No way! I'm not letting my best friend get recycled. Not for five cents, not for
  five hundred cents! Leela, I've got a plan!
- (whispering) Why would Nixon stay at the Watergate?
- Keep going, we're right behind you.
- Ooh!  Uh-oh!
- Well, he lost my vote.
- Hey, I've got one last thought.
- What?
- Why would robots vote for Nixon now that he's just a head in a jar?
- Well it's not my fault either 'cause I forgot to vote.
- This snow is beautiful. I'm glad global warming never happened.
- Hi!
- Look out! We're heading straight for those trees!
- Cool. Hey what do you do if you want the trees up?
- (hoarse) Trees down!
- Yup, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics then retired to promote alcoholic
  beverages.
- Oh, what the hell!  Ow!
- Yeah, it really puts you in the Christmas spirit.
- Christmas. You know? X-M-A-S.
- Xmas, huh?  Y'know this'll be my first Xmas away from home.
- Yeah! An old-fashioned Xmas tree!
- Hey! These aren't Xmas trees!
- They're supposed to be some kinda, you know, pine tree.
- This isn't the way Christmas is supposed to be.
- Everything's changed.
- (nostalgic) Every Christmas my mom would get a fresh goose for goose burgers and
  my dad would whip up his special eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes. This dumb
  holiday just makes me think of all the things I left behind. Let's just stop talking
  about Xmas.
- What's the point of Xmas when everyone you know died a thousand years ago? I'm the
  lonliest person on Earth.  Hey, Leela, how 'bout a little sympathy here, huh?  Yoiks!
  What was that about?
- My God! Poor Leela.
- I feel like a rat. Here I am whining like a pig while all along Leela was lonely
  as a frog. I could kick myself.
- Ow! Thanks.
- Whose blood?
- I've got to do something to show Leela how sorry I am.
- So it's left, left, right-- Wait! I have a better idea! I'll go out and get her
  the perfect Xmas present. Something so great she'll never want to be unhappy again.
- We'll see. I like to haggle.
- Say what?
- I know about Santa Claus.
- Wow! 2801! Anyway...
- There's this girl who I really like but she thinks I'm a jerk. Can you help me?
- No, I need to get her a gift. And I need it before sundown.
- That's funny!
- You're the last store open. I need something for my friend Leela.  Just give me
  your best animal.
- That's a stupid animal. You're stupid! I said I want the best one. Now which costs
  more? The parrot or the Stink Lizard?
- That's a hell of a good parrot. Although, I could get 500 lizards for the same price.
  Girls like swarms of lizards, right?
- Alright, I'll take the 500 lizards. No, wait, yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes! The parrot!
- Well, I spent every penny I had but I bet Leela's gonna love you.  Hey, you're quite
  the talker, aren't you? Shut the hell up!  Ow!  Stupid bird! I know where you live.
- Alright, bird, you thought you could beat me in a game of wits. But you just met
  your equal.
- Aha! Cornered!
- Leela! Oh, my God! You saved my life. I am gonna get you so many lizards.
- I just wanted to do something to make you happy. I mean, I miss my family but you
  never even had a family.
- Merry Xmas, Leela.
- Oh, boy! It's Santa!
- Well check it twice!
- No! I swear!
- Please let us live! We'll put out milk and cookies for you!
- 'I never thought it would end this way: Gunned down by Santa Claus. Honestly, I
  didn''t see it coming!'
- 'Goodbye, Leela.  Hey, look: We''re under the mistletoe.'
- Uh, you're present may need some assembly.
- (shouting) Help!
- (shouting; from outside) Help!
- (shouting) He's gonna blow.
- Uh, Bender? Where did you get that bird?
- Look, the food isn't what's important.
- The important thing is we're all together for Xmas. And even though I'm surrounded
  by robots and monsters and old people, I've never felt more at home.
- 'Mmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a thousand years of progress: A Bavarian creamdog
  that''s also self-microwaving!'
- Sack?
- Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!
- Ah, futuristic!
- Hey, Leela, look who's the super-stud!
- Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, what's that jazz on your head?
- Maybe he has a parasite.
- (simultaneously) No, Amy!
- Eck!
- Oh, baby, I'm there!
- Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested in. (shouting) Uh, no need to pack
  pants, people. Let's roll!
- Is that how you say "Zoidberg"?
- Who's the lucky lobsterina?
- You and me both, brother!
- I didn't come here to see any activity involving two guys. Where do you people do
  your erotic display?
- Hey, I wonder if these guys are here to watch the erotic display too.
- Look how ridiculous they look.
- Hey! I can get any girl I want anytime I want. I'm just too busy.
- Listen, Doc, if you wanna score you gotta fake like you're in love.  Just look her
  in the eye, start crying and say (fake crying) "I've never been so happy".
- OK, you're on a date. What's the first thing you do?
- No. Tell her she's special.
- Well, tell her that. And then?
- No. Make up some feelings and tell her you have them.  Yes?
- You're not even trying!
- OK, OK, don't worry. The love meister will take you under his wing.
- OK, go ahead.
- (whispering) You just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating.
- '(whispering) Start with a compliment: Tell her she looks thin.'
- (whispering) Now ask her how her day was.
- (whispering) You wouldn't. Ask anyway.
- (whispering) That's normal. Just nod your head and say "Uh-huh"
- (whispering) Third date!
- (whispering) Turn it over.
- That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
- Nope. Must be some weird alien emotion.
- No thanks. I just came to tell you that Zoidberg's really great. He's got male jelly
  coming out the wazoo.
- Uh, I'm flattered, really. If I was gonna do it with a big, freaky mud bug you'd
  be way up the list!
- Dr. Zoidberg, it's not how it looks.
- But--
- What?!
- English please?
- But I don't want her!
- Leela!
- Fatal.
- (shouting) Shut up!
- Shh! Nobody correct him!
- But it's a fight to the death!
- Uh-oh.
- Hey!
- Aha!  Oops!
- My fellow fish monsters. Far be it for me to question your stupid civilisation or
  its dumb customs. But is squeezing each others brains out with a giant nutcracker
  really going to solve anything? Dr. Zoidberg is my friend. And though a woman has
  come between us, I say we'll always remain friends. And you know why?  One reason.
- You bastard! I'll kill you! You bastard!
- Aw. I'm sorry, Doc.
- Ow, ow! Ah!
- I'll lend you this.
- Hey, hey.
- You mean you have to choose between a life without sex and a gruesome death?
- Tough call.
- No biggie.
- (laughing) Yeah!
- I don't mean to nitpick, super-doc, but do you think maybe you could take one more
  whack at this?
- (from ship) My legs!
- No wonder you've been staying at the back of conga lines lately.
- Yup, she's beautiful coffee alright.
- Sorry, I'm not here to buy.
- I care! I care plenty! I just don't know how to make them stop!
- Valentine's Day's coming? Oh, crap! I forgot to get a girlfriend again. Well since
  neither of us has a date, why don't we...
- Shall we say 8 o'clock?
- Yeah, OK. What's the weather like?
- So, what? Shorts?
- Boy, this A.C. is incredible!  I'd better turn on the heater too.  (shouting) Boy,
  this heater is incredible! I'd better turn up the A.C. some more.
- (shouting) Yeah!  We're slowing down!
- (shouting) Who wants pop-tarts?  Uh-oh!
- What are you doing?
- Phew!
- 'Hey, tell me something: You''ve got all this money, how come you always dress like
  you''re doing your laundry?'
- I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants.
  What am I, the Pope?
- Yeah, it's like we feel the same way about junk and stuff, or, whatever.
- Yeah.
- Kind of.
- And it led there again when we got home.
- What? No!
- (whispering) It's working, they think we're making out.  Wait, why aren't we making
  out?
- Wow! We're great kissers!
- Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how we
  sort of think exactly alike, and junk.
- Everything was going great. Then all of a sudden, she's talking about hanging out.
  Hangin out? She's getting way too serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela.
- Don't you get it? She's smothering me.
- You see? You see? Now she's bothering me when I'm at work.
- I'm doing my job -- there's Amy. I spend a few hours selecting a candy from the
  machine -- there's Amy. I wake up the morning after sleeping with Amy -- there's
  Amy!
- Am I? (shouting) Am I? (talking) Face it, I'm a prize catch.  I mean, I'm pulling
  down delivery boy money.
- Then she wants me as a trophy husband. Leela, you gotta come to Europa with us,
  I can't be alone with her.
- Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics with just you and me?  Uh, Dr. Zoidberg.
- Jeez, we're already planning to spend Valentine's Day together. Isn't that enough?
- Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending Valentine's Day together?
- That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, you drive.
- (from inside) Pardon me, excuse me.
- Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate but then you start to get tired of
  it because it always wants to hang out with you?
- Look, could chocolate just let me finish?
- Amy, what I'm trying to say is, I think maybe you and I should stop--
- Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? Was anybody hurt?
- How badly?
- Where is it?
- Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere with your life too much.
- Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm.
- Oh, that.  Maybe we'd better talk in private. (whispering) I'll meet you in the
  closet.
- Amy, I really like you, as a friend. But I think we're spending too much time together.
- I just think we should start seeing other people.
- I'm sorry, but it is.
- Huh?
- Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!
- (happy) Oh! (disappointed) Oh!
- Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you for a minute?  In private?
- This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's plans with some goon and I'm gonna be
  stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will you be my date, please?
- Then I have no choice but to do something so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm ashamed
  to tell you about it.
- Thanks.
- Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something to happen
  with your Valentine's date?
- 'And another thing: You''re using an awful lot of make-up there.'
- What does it do?
- 20 minutes? You're practically ready now!
- Oh, God, it's true!
- (simultaneously) Thanks.  Where is she?
- I've got a date. She'll be along any minute.
- Uh--
- (whispering) She seems a little old for me.
- Oh, yeah? Well I want one too.
- But you just said--
- Well, ma'am I--
- No, but I control this arm.
- Wait, come back, uh, darling.
- Oh, jeez, get a room!
- 'Hey, I have an idea: Let''s all go out for ice cream.'
- Nooo!  That's it I'm gettin' the hell outta here.  Ooh! Ow!
- Oh, Leela!
- Can I live without it?
- So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And I hope there are no hard feelings about your
  date, or stuff.
- Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own body back.
- Seems to be. My neck's just a little tender.  Ow! Cool!  Ow! Listen, Leela. Thanks
  for rescuing me last night.
- I guess so.  Watch the neck! Watch the neck!
- Nah. If I ever wanna go back to the year 2000 I'll just freeze myself again.
- Cool, it's just like the good old days!
- Hey Leela, get a picture of me being "mugged."
- Yeah I asked a cop once. It means "Up yours kid."
- Uh, sorry Bender that's just a phone booth.
- In New York? Bathrooms.
- I'll show you.  Whup.
- No, it's a mobile apartment with no rent.
- We sometimes called it a jogging suit.
- Hey, my girlfriend had one of those! Actually it wasn't her's it was her dad's.
  Actually she wasn't my girlfriend. She just lived next door and never closed her
  curtains.
- C'mon, let's sneak in for a closer look.
- Hey! This is from Miller's Outpo - uh, I mean, yeah, I work here alright!
- Nope.  No one in New York drove. There was too much traffic.  Nice! Listen to that
  baby purr!
- It's just like riding a bicyc -
- I'm just glad we hit something. I thought we'd never stop.
- How's that robot I ran over?
- You mean he's -
- I don't get it.
- So uh, Flexo. Sorry about crushing your body like that. You OK now?
- Well just let me know if there's anything I can do to make it up to you.
- Uh...sure.
- How's that?
- Uh I can't get any lower than this.
- I don't like this place. It's 120 degrees and there's very little oxygen.
- (unsure) Uh, yeah. Look at that exhaust fan.
- Uh, no, that's alright.  Ow! Ow!
- I'm telling you there's something about Flexo I don't like.
- Yeah keep laughing brineshrimp but he's bad news. I regret ever running him over.
- He's much worse. He drinks, he smokes and he posts naked pictures of me on the internet.
- I'm talking about Flexo.
- No I'm not. Mark my words. Flexo's evil. He's the evil Bender.
- Can I touch it?
- Uh, maybe we should stick with people we know and trust. I mean, Flexo's great but
  -
- Wait, I don't like the sound of that. Let's just go alphabetically.
- Wait, let's go by rank.
- Flexo outranks me?
- Don't point that at me.
- Look, I know Flexo's your friend but I don't trust him alone with the atom.
- I'm not prejudiced.
- Caught you!  I saw you looking at the atom!
- Oh-ho you'd like it if I went to sleep wouldn't you?
- Yeah well here's a funny joke. I'm gonna sit right here till it's my shift.
- That I will.
- Good.
- Good.
- Good.  Good.
- Well, that's eight hours.
- Finally, the atom is safe.
- No.
- He must have used a sleep ray on me. Sleep rays exist in the future right?
- Then I must've fallen asleep.
- Aha!  Uh searching...hmm.
- I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check again.
- (suspicious) Say Bender, can I hold that map for a second?
- Give it up!
- Or maybe, he never left at all!  Wait a minute. You're Bender.
- But why were you wearing that scarf, that turtleneck and this fruity number?
- 100,000?
- Well, we'll be leaving now. If you'll just sign this form saying you received the
  atom.
- Flexo!
- Flexo! Shoot Flexo!
- Bender? You stole the atom?
- Whoa whoa, you mean Bender is the evil Bender? I am shocked, shocked! Well not that
  shocked.
- I'm so confused. The Bender I liked turn out to be evil and the Bender I hated was
  good. How can I live my life when I can't tell good from evil?
- Well, you guys might both be losers but I just made out with that radiator woman
  from the radiator planet.
- Oh.  Is there a burn ward within 10 feet of here?
- Hey, Hermes!
- Hermes has all the fun. Wait a second! He's got a Brain Slug on his head!
- Hey, yeah!
- Cool, let's see this one!
- Yeah, I wanna see that.
- I'll take a small Slurm.
- Uh, OK.  Oh, man!
- (sarcastic) Ooh, this is real futuristic!
- No I didn't!
- Hey! How come when I wanna do fun stuff that'll kill me you're against it?
- (shouting) Bender rules!
- Wow! Thanks, Hermes!  I-- Hey! Cut that out!
- Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro wrestling. But it turns
  out it's fixed, like boxing.
- Bender? How did the fight go? I heard somebody got flattened!
- Hey!
- My God! It's full of ads!
- It's immense.
- So I see!
- Well, thanks to the internet, I'm bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that
  panders to my lust for violence?
- Oh Leela. I feel terrible. If there's anything I can ever do -  Gotcha!  I won!
  I'm the greatest!
- Are you still mad at me for wrecking your once in a lifetime chance to learn the
  meaning of your existence?
- Kicked your ass!
- Too bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn delivery.
- Lazy sculptor!
- Hmm, you got any sacred artwork of her from the back?
- What's over that hill?
- Is that anything like a cemetary 'cause I gotta take a leak.  Ow!
- Ow!
- Mmm! Great pancakes Leela!
- He may be some lowlife jerk but I don't trust him. I think he's hiding something
  and I'm gonna find out what it is.
- Try and stop me!
- '''Cause I think Alkazar''s hding something. Listen Leela, you may not like it,
  you may not believe it, you may not wanna hear it but Alkazar''s a jerk, he''s bad
  for you. He -'
- You do?
- Then dump his one eyed ass.
- I'll be there.
- C'mon Leela you deserve better than this guy! Dump him already!
- Ohh!
- Pst, Leela. you've got to get me out of here. It's horrible, eating scraps, letting
  my waste drop wherever it falls like an animal in the zoo.
- The corner! Why didn't I think of that?
- That's it! It's time for this bird to walk.
- Bender come on. We've got to get some dirt on Alkazar. Lets go and find out what
  makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden.
- But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal.
- Bender, snap out of it!
- Come on boy, jump!  Good boy!
- My God! Four identical castles!
- That's weird. It's another Cyclops, only this one has five eyes.
- Hey Alkazar, you left somebody off the guest list.
- Oh yeah? Then what about this?
- And maybe you'd like to meet her.  And her.
- Hey, that's what I do.
- I'll play.
- Wow, you look happy. Is someone fired?
- Jamaican? I thought you were some kinda outer space potato man.
- What's with the specs Bender?
- Hey!
- It doesn't matter how many human females you have, Bender's on a hot streak.
- Oh man!
- Aw hey c'mon don't worry. We'll watch you clean up.
- Uh, I can explain that. See, it used to be milk and, well, time makes fools of us
  all.
- Uh wait, this is the other Fry's locker. I'm Phry with a "Ph."
- What the hell's going on? I thought you were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.
- Just like very other girl I've dated.
- All right!
- Morgan? It's 3am.
- Eat and sleep.
- Uh wait, Bender's my rooommate. He could be back any second.
- Morgan, come back! He's stuck in a loop!
- Hey, what did you do to him?
- But, but...Bender need brain...for...smart making!  What did you do now? Stop doing
  things!
- No, he was a bad friend. I want him back right now.
- I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy.
- I couldn't help it. She loved me because of the part of me that's a slob and I loved
  her because of the part of me that's desperate.
- Poor Bender. Without his brain he's become all quiet and helpful. We've got to go
  to the Central Bureaucracy and get that disk back!
- Man, how long is this gonna take?
- OK.
- We'll never find that disk will we Bender?
- You're right. Nothing is over so long as there's one thin ray of hope.
- Listen Morgan, We're through, you're an evil heartless woman and I never wanna see
  you again. However would you help us get Bender back for old times sake?
- Yeah!
- That's right, she fraternized me!
- What about me? Can I come back at severely reduced pay?
- Oh.  Thank you. Y'know, when I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Professor
  Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later Leela made the film. But if I had
  made the film, you could bet there would have been a lot more topless women on motorcycles!
  Roll film!
- (whispering) Dork alert!
- Leela! He could live another 100 years!
- Wow, a whole planet of old people. Where is it?
- A successor?
- Man, the Professor's been in his lab for days.
- Sorry everyone but need I remind you? Blood is thicker than water.
- One foot in the grave.
- Oh yeah!
- Crud. Can I at least be in charge of your dentures?
- Where did Cubert come from?
- Well, once in the park.
- Little twerp.
- We've gotta get him back.
- Nothing is impossible. You'd know that if you really took after the Professor, like
  I do.
- Uh...what?
- To the left!  No to the up!  U-turn, U-turn!
- I'm on it!
- I'd like to see them find it!
- '''Cause you''re too ugly to be a wart.'
- What? I'm old. Listen. (old man voice) Hey you kids, get off the lawn!
- Uh....I-I've got talking hump syndrome.
- So this is where they stick old people. It's horrific.
- Will too.
- Come on Leela, step your big boot down on the gas pedal.
- Fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it! Fix it fix it fix it!
- Try shocking him.
- Damnit, we'll have to fix the engine ourself.
- So what were they doing to you in that awful drawer?
- This contest is as good as over. I once caught a fish this big.
- (whispering) Quiet, Bender, you're scaring away the fish.
- I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards!
- A shrimp?  I find it a bit hard to believe that--
- Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's
  bigger than anything you've caught. Ow! My small intestine!
- (shouting) Hey, Bender, I just caught a fish this big!
- It's diving!
- How many atmospheres can this ship withstand?
- How do we do that?
- Wait, I'll be back in a minute.
- Did what?
- I'd better go too. They don't know what I like.
- I can't swallow that.
- (blubberling) Mermaid.
- A mermaid!
- No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing a tube top and she had a beautiful scaley
  tail. And I think she had hair extensions.
- What's so far-fetched about mermaids? I mean, there's all sorts of weird sea creatures
  here in the future. Like Dr. Zoidberg.
- Every time something good happens to me you say it's some kind of madness, or I'm
  drunk, or I ate too much candy. Well I saw a real mermaid and I wish for once my
  friends would have decency and kindness to believe me.
- (muttering) Ocean madness, yeah right. It's always something, ain't it?  (talking)
  It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here! Wake up!  Oh! oxygen!
- Hey! I can breath and talk, just like a fish!
- What?
- I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?
- Aw, yeah!
- I can't believe you're really real. I like your tail.
- Oh, Thanks. They're called pants.
- No kidding.
- Sure, sometimes it falls from the sky.
- And sometimes it doesn't.
- You know what I like best about you, Umbriel? You find me fascinating even when
  I'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer.
- Yup. We call them land-sealions ... I tame them!
- Hey, you guys, the most amazing thing happened. It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy
  Kreme! Plus there's mermaids.
- I think it was just an airport. They had a place where you could buy nuts.
- That's right, honey! Whatever you say.
- Aw, shucks, Colonel.
- Wait. I'm not going with you.
- Realise it? I don't even understand it!
- I don't care. I'm staying. I've got everything I want right here.
- Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join the country club.
- You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours have been the happiest days of my life.
- Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the vapours!
- Yeah I'm a little confused too. How do I ... y'know ... with the tail and all?
- (gasping) Why couldn't she be the other type of mermaid, with the fish part on top
  and the lady part on the bottom?
- Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me here!
- Well, it turns out I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her.
- Ow! Bender, you're hurting me. Ow!
- No. In fact, it looks so nice I think I might get one too.
- (cheering) Yeah!
- No thanks. That's robot food.
- No really I don't -  Mmm!
- $1200?
- No, I was just picking my nose.
- He's made of candy.
- (cheering) Alright!
- But we're about to take off. We gotta eat our blastoff sundaes.
- Bender's sick.  Need any help taking off?
- Wow, it's too bad you can't see Leela 'cause theres a cool ship out there shooting
  at somebody.
- Uh, Leela?
- Great, great. The one time I forgot to buy flight insurance.
- Unless you let us live. Then you'll get off scot free.
- No!
- (whispering) Oh no, poor Bender.
- Leela, we may not have much time left......so let's spend all of it reminscing about
  Bender. He was like a big computer than ran on magic.
- You're OK!
- I'm telling you, Leela was cool, she was in command, and when she kicked people
  it hurt. It really hurt.
- It's funny Bender. With you sick and Leela blind only I know what really went on
  out there. Maybe someday I'll tell you the whole story.
- I hate the Planet of the Moochers. They take you out for a drink, but when the check
  comes, their wallet's always in their other pants - which they borrowed from me!
- Ugh!
- Maybe that planet over there has a drive-thru. A Burger Jerk or a Fishy Joe's or
  a Chizzler or something.
- I'm experienced at foraging. I used to find edible mushrooms on my bath mat.
- Here's something. It looks like a ditch full of fried shrimp.
- Well? How are they?  Oh, they're great! They're like sex! Except I'm having them!
- Look! Here's more!
- Let's bring back a couple of pocketfuls.
- I know, we'll call them Popplers!
- Swish!
- Hey, yeah.
- Hey, business is great.
- Wow! You're some guy who eats at Fishy Joe's?
- A dollar a dozen.
- How do we sign?
- Leela! That's the second billboard you've crashed into this week!
- Look, Leela, even if you heard one talk, that doesn't mean it's intelligent. I mean,
  parrots talk and we eat them, right?
- Like Fry! Like Fry!
- People, I won't let you enter. Popplers are as intelligent as you or me.
- Turanga?
- I wish they'd just wipe out humanity and get it over with. It's the waiting I can't
  stand.
- What Bender means is, you're really brave, and smart, and beautiful, and a great
  friend.
- You mean -
- That's Leela!
- No!
- Hear, hear!
- Mmm, let me get some of that suckling pig.
- OK.
- Man, there's clouds of exhaust everywhere.
- Not really.
- Hey, who's this guy?
- I'm sorry, I-I thought you were made of wax.
- I mean, I thought you were one of the wax robots.
- Hey, Bender. Here's an exhibit about Mom's favourite robot.
- Yeah, uh, I'd like a cup of coffee, please.
- Yes, please.
- Oh, uh, OK.
- Yes, uh, eight spoons.
- Uh, Leela, I think there might be something wrong with the coffee machine.
- Violent media? What a load of -
- No!
- Well, we can live without machines. I was in Webelos.
- 'In my time, we didn''t depend on high-tech gadgets like you do. We didn''t need
  a mechanical washing unit to wash our clothes. We just used a washing machine. And
  look: You don''t need an electric can-opener to feed yourself. All you need is a
  trusty Swiss Army knife. Ow!  (crying) I''m hungry!'
- W-W-Wait. You mean, you, and Mom?
- Hey, the TV's getting away!
- Professor, please. The fate of the world depends on you getting to second base with
  Mom.
- Wait. In my time, we had a way of moving things long distances without hovering.
- It was called...let me think. It was really famous - Ruth Gordon had one. The wheel!
- There. Finished!
- (snappy) It's my invention, we do it my way! Now all we need is something to pull
  it and we're set!
- Ow!
- And if that doesn't work, I got you a six-pack of champagne and a funnel.
- Yes!
- Nothing in here but a couple of elephant skin rugs.
- There it is!
- Is anything not a robot?
- Hurry, Bender. Get the bra!
- Ooh!
- Yeah, it's really long. But what did you just turn on with it?
- Does it really work?
- I'm so lonely since I came to the future. Will you be my friend?  Ow!
- Who are you?
- You too? Will you be my friend?
- (shouting) Stop! The robot's not your enemy! He's just a poor, misunderstood--
- Hey, Bender?
- Wanna make Shrinky Dinks?
- Goodnight, sweet prince.
- Yeah, be more impulsive. Like this.
- Ew! What smells like boot feet?
- I'm bored. You're boring, Zoidberg. I'm gonna go watch TV.
- Whatcha eating?
- Sure.  Y'know, I think I finally figured out what's behind all these mysterious
  deaths.
- Was Planet Express built on an Indian graveyard?
- No?
- Then ... then ... it was you!
- Well, that covers the first three killings.
- I like it!
- I really like it!
- Um, I have a question. What if Bender was really giant?
- I know. I liked it. I wanna see it again.
- Oh, alright. How 'bout this? What if I never fell into that freezer-doodle and came
  to the future-jiggy?
- Hello? Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener?! Aw, crud!  Here's to another lousy Millennium!
  Ow!  I should have left you floating in the toilet!
- Who are you monsters? Is one of you Icy Wiener?
- You believe me about the monsters, right, Mr. Panucci?
- Hey! Stephen Hawking! Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?
- 'Let me ask you something: Has anyone ever discovered a hole in nothing with monsters
  in it?  ''Cause if I''m the first, I want them to call it "a Fry Hole".'
- (from alley) Who said that?  Hey! What the--? Ooh! Ow! Ow!
- Who are you people?
- I thought your duty was to cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.
- Hmm. So I guess you'll wanna see my Fry Hole.
- Where am I, anyway?
- So what do you nerds want?
- No fair! I saw it first!
- So then my chair tilted back and I almost fell into this freezer thingy.
- But instead of falling in and getting frozen, I missed and wanged my head.
- Uh, what?
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Alright. But I need a weapon to fight off drunken robots when I wake up.
- OK, here I go.
- Eh? What's the worst thing that can happen?
- Destroyed? Then where are we now?
- Sure.
- Good work.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. When's the funeral?
- Bender, wake up!  He's OK! Quick, does anyone have any liquor?
- Poor Bender, you're seeing things. You've been drinking too much, or too little,
  I forget how it works with you. Anyway, you haven't drunk exactly the right amount.
- Aw, relax buddy. You were probably just shooting some big, fuzzy craps.
- Geez Bender, you're scaring me. You're going wacko!
- I wouldn't wanna be me right now.
- It'll be a rich, full day.
- (shouting) Bender, no!
- (shouting) You jerk. I thought I was your best friend. What kind of two-timing kill-mobile
  are you?
- I can't believe this. Bender is supposed to murder his closest friend, which I thought
  was me. But he went straight for you. He didn't even try to second-degree murder
  me.
- Stop rubbing it in.
- Not physically. But why don't you ask your new best friend, Leela?
- Words. Nothing sweet, sweet words that turn into bitter orange wax in my ears.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Thanks, eagle eye.
- I once had a best friend who liked to smell things with me.
- Look, are you the original were-car or not?
- Knight Rider wasn't evil.
- Hey, Project Satan! Over here! I'm a blind pedestrian. 20 points!
- (gasping) Yes! He chose me! He's trying to kill me! Leela, I'm so happy!  (talking)
  Oh, thanks Bender.  (choking) Too tight! Too tight!
- Bender, I'm alive!  You didn't hurt me at all. But I know you wanted to, and that's
  what matters.  Here's to you.
- I'll kill you too, buddy. I'll kill you too!
- Hm, Spider, Hubble, Nitrogum...ooh, Big Pink! It's the only gum with the breath-freshening
  power of ham.
- I believe you're forgetting about our 5% military discount.
- Full price for gum? That dog won't hunt, Monsignor.
- Just out of curiosity, we could use the cards to buy gum, then immediately quit
  the army, right?
- What's that?
- And this ham gum is all bone.
- Cool effect!
- Uh, just so we'll know, who's the enemy?
- Whoa! Check out that guy. He makes Speedy Gonzales look like Regular Gonzales.
- Mind if we sit with you?
- Good point...I guess.
- Well, I sort of a have a thing for this girl I work with.
- Cyclops.
- It's creepy here.
- And then the battle's not so bad?
- What's happening?
- The enemy! They're balls!
- Oh, right.
- (shouting) Bender! No!
- That wasn't cowardice.
- That doesn't sound too bad.
- (singing) I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh.
- What's the word...uh...sir?
- We don't have long!
- OK, I gotta break down that gate, beat up those three guards, steal that chopper
  and rescue Bender.  Hey, I did it! Wait, that's not me.
- You wanna save him too, Lemon? You barely know him.
- Hermes?
- Leela!
- OK, my best friend's life is at stake. I can finally prove that I'm not a coward.
  Will you push me?
- (shouting) Thank you!  At last, war has made me into a man.
- Stop! You can't say the next word.
- Bender, if you say the A-word and you'll blow this planet straight to the H-word!
- All right! Hey. Wait a minute! This is your home planet? We're the evil, invading
  aliens?
- No.
- Bender!
- Giant Space Robot, this is Captain Fry of the USS Planet Express Ship; We come in
  peace.
- Well, we destroyed the toy spaceship. Now what are we gonna do?
- Do you think we should?
- Woo, yeah!
- That's the best thing I ever saw!
- That was great!
- Yeah, Leela.
- What are we supposed to do for money? All I've got is my frequent taffy eater's
  card, my first moustache......and this picture of me and my old girlfriend, Michelle,
  and that ski instructor she was just friends with.
- Well, what do you suggest? A daring daylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant-back?
  That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!
- Our what?
- And then what happened?
- Ow!
- They're OK.
- Hey, I was frozen. I think I know what people wanna hear when they first wake up.  Bathroom's
  that way.
- So, while you're on the Probulator, tell me, what brings you to the future?
- Nope. Straight line.  Ah, the Probulator's done.
- Oh, wait, it hasn't started yet.  OK, it's about to start.
- Nothing like a power nap.
- I ordered a pizza.
- Sorry, but if it's not here in half an hour, it's free.
- Well, uh, I've got 33 minutes.
- OK, I'll fight the box. I think I can take him.
- No.  No!  Oh, my God! It's Pauly Shore!
- Mr. Shore, I loved you in Bio-Dome. You sure caused some trouble in that bubble!
- Hey, now that you're in the future, you can go live in an actual bio-dome!
- Oh.  How did you wind up getting frozen?
- The weasel?
- I woke you up early so we could hang out and do stuff.
- I love this job.
- Showtime! (hoarse) I'll pretend to be dying of space plague.
- Michelle!
- I don't know. Is it really you?
- Who wants to know?
- I don't get it, Michelle. The last time I saw you, you were doing great. You had
  just dumped me and you were well on your way to getting you life back on track.
  Why'd you freeze yourself?
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.
- Uh, sorry.
- (voice-over) Sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- Aww. So you froze yourself to come look for me?
- That's the same reason they kept me out of school. So, no one even cared that I
  was gone?
- Who was it?
- Not everything. There's still a roach problem.
- Nowadays, people aren't interested in art that's not tattooed on fat guys.
- Hey, guys.
- I'm glad you're all here. I wanted to introduce you to my on-again-off-again girlfriend
  of the past thousand years, Michelle.  Michelle, this is Leela. This is Bender.  The
  professor.  Hermes and Amy.
- And this is Dr. Zoidberg.
- All what?
- But things are different this time. Before, she was demanding and possessive. But
  now she wants me to do stuff and stay with her all the time.
- Yeah, they're great, huh?
- Oh, right. I was supposed to assign you a job. Let me just get your career chip
  installed.  Hold out your palm. What are you scared of? It's just like getting your
  hand pierced.
- Ooh, romantic. I'll tell Bender to meet us there.
- Whoa, whoa, girl. I thought you were talking about one of those motels where the
  bed is shaped like stuff.
- Well, sure. To the extent a man can love a woman. But this seems like a big step.
- You're right. Let's do this now and let's never regret it.
- Michelle, I don't regret this. But I both rue and lament it.
- The year 4000 is severely disappointing. I miss the year 3000 when life was simple
  and brains flew through space and everyone ate lasers.
- No, you brought us here.
- Alright, fine. Everything else sucks. At least we can have a nice place to live.
- Ooh, there.
- It'd be deeper, but I'm standing on a gopher.
- They'll save us.  We're saved!
- Mighty sir, we have nowhere to go. Could we please join your society?
- I tell you, that Butch runs a pretty good civilisation. I think I'll enjoy serving
  under him.
- What do I need, ulcers?
- Alright, alright. If it'll make you happy, I'll overthrow society.
- Well, I'm older than you. I can beat you up.
- What's death rolling?
- Oh, so it's a little safer than skateboarding.
- (sadly) Beth said that?
- Aww. Poor little guy. Let me just take a look at - aha!  I won! I'm the new chief!
  I'm the tallest and I weigh the most!
- I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded out.
- Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it all. Several friends, a low-paying job, a bed
  in a robot's closet. I envied no man. But you wrecked everything.
- 'Oh, yeah? Well, listen to this: (whispering) I''m leaving you.'
- There must be people somewhere.
- Yes! Footprints! And hand prints?  But? What's happening?
- Leela? What are you guys doing here in the year 4000?
- So you're saying these aren't the decaying ruins of New York in the year 4000?
- But there was this gang of 10-year olds with guns.
- But everyone is driving around in cars shooting at each other.
- But the air's green and there's no sign of civilisation whatsoever.
- And the people are all phoneys. No one reads. Everything has cilantro on it -  Michelle,
  baby!
- That's it. I've had it with women. From now on, I'm concentrating on my career.
  Can I have my old job back?
- A tomato.
- Eh, what's the worst thing that could happen?  Ugh, it's like there's a party in
  my mouth and everyone's throwing up!
- That jerk! No one hoots at my captain unless they're prepared to take it to the
  next level!
- Hey jumbo! How would you like it if Leela said you were sexy and she wanted to make
  love with you?
- You take that back! She does not look good for a truck stop chick!
- She does too! She's loaded with meat! She's got more meat than a cow!  Ow!
- I can't please Leela no matter what I do! I just want her to like me.
- Well my lead pipe hurts a little?
- No.
- I've had better.
- What about what?
- I'd love to!
- Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious how an aromatic chain of hydrocarbons can evoke
  our deepest emotions.  For you.
- I don't think so.  Sir, I believe you owe this lady an apology.
- Anything.
- Leela, there's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time but every time
  I try I get nervous and my mouth feels like it's stuffed with peanut butter, even
  when it's not.
- No, it's about you and me.
- Bender's not involved.  Leela...I love you.
- Yes. But it's only recently I've been able to articulate my thoughts. I love you
  Leela and I always have.
- Yeah! I don't know why but my life really turned around that day!
- Please......I need something to settle my stomach.
- If anyone wants to tell me what's going on here, I'll be in the lounge.
- Of all the parasites I've had over the years, these worms are among the - hell!
  They are the best! Leela, how can I ever repay you for saving them?
- Apartment 1I. The old me would have made a joke about that!
- I think the view's perfect already.
- Wait. In a minute.
- They don't have you to inspire them.
- When I'm with you, everyday seems like double-soup Tuesday.
- What I've become.
- There's just something I have to find out.
- Who controls this bowel?
- You mean colon?
- Your excellency, have you ever been in love?
- Well, a wonderful girl loves me. But I need to know if it's really me she loves,
  or just what you worms have made of me. That's why with all due respect, I'm asking
  you to leave.
- Everyone out of my body or the brain gets it!
- Obviously you've never been in love! Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Now, the hand-eye co-ordination
  lobe.
- I was just working my way towards the medulla oblongata - control centre of the
  heart and lungs. And if I kill myself, you die with me.
- I hope Satan has a nice colon, 'cause that's where you're gonna be living!
- I'm about to.  Leela, let me play for you one for time.
- Please, it's important to me.
- I don't know. I got nervous and started thinking about neck bolts.  Wow! Did you
  see that vase break? It was all like -
- Nothing. I got rid of the worms.
- Leela, I had worms. I needed to know who you loved. Me or them.
- I did. I think. It was probably about 50/50. But that's how I really felt about
  you, I swear!
- Please. Give me a chance to be romantic on my own. I've got a baggy of massage oil,
  and I'm gonna give you my super back rub, just like a I used to give Amy when I
  was going out with her, and she always seemed... - Uh-oh!
- Well, at least I learned Leela's a lost cause. I give up.
- He's got me beat!
- He's dead.
- I can't believe Leela and Amy aren't back yet from their half-date. I'm gonna call
  the restaurant.
- We gotta go rescue them!
- "Bender! Think of the se\xF1oritas!"
- Oh, no! Any sign of Leela or Amy?
- I don't know. But it might have something to do with this.
- Alright, here's the plan--
- Pfft. A female leader?
- Yes, captain!
- Is she hot?
- In other words, "No".  Ow!
- It was an accident, ma'am.
- Leela, I'm through making fun of women. Now I want them to help me.
- What'd they die of?
- Yes!
- (cheering) Yay!
- Although the snu-snu part's gonna be pretty good.
- Goodbye, friends. I never thought I would die like this. But I'd always really hoped.
- (from inside) Ooh! Yeah!
- Can't we just cuddle?  (screaming) Nooo!
- Oh, yeah!
- Making the noise.
- Yep.
- That doesn't look like an "L" at all. Unless you count lowercase.
- Who would do a thing like that?
- Huh?
- Wait! There on the screen. It's that guy you are.
- You weren't sleepwalking. You were sleep-bending!
- You're only four years old?
- Professor, I've never seen you so cheerful. What the hell's wrong with you?
- I wish! It's a nickel.
- Alright!
- She sure does.
- Yeah. Either that or be a man.
- That's thinkin' like a man.
- Professor, we're all sick of your upbeat attitude.
- Man, that's dog's gonna be hard to beat. Look at him bring in the sheep! One sheep,
  two sheep......three sheep.
- I love these things!
- Don't listen to them, Leela. People said I was dumb, but I proved them.
- Looks like this planet is next in line.
- I'd hate to be those guys.
- Leela back yet?
- You don't have a heart; you're a robot.
- Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal.
- Bender, if this is some kind of scam, I don't get it. You already have my power
  of attorney.
- Dr. Zoidberg? Why is everyone acting so weird?
- (angry) I just let you back in!
- Man, even the news monster is acting strange. What are we gonna do?
- Wait a minute! I know what's going on here. You've all become idiots!
- Attention New New Yorkers. Stop acting so stupid!
- Time to re-educate you duncebags. We'll start with US presidents.  This is our first
  president, George Washington. Let's review. Who was our first president?
- Leela! I've been so worried. Are you a bonehead?
- Whoa, whoa! Slow down. You're going a mile a minute.
- Thanks!
- No, Leela. Brain make people smart.
- Even bigger than those? Holy nuts! Where is it?
- Hm. A giant brain is basically a giant nerd. And where would a giant nerd be? The
  libary!
- I'm here to kick your ass.
- That's right. And I think you'll find that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing!  OK,
  better think of a new plan. Come on, Fry, think!  Thinking...thinking...
- Hey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can think of a way to use that.  Aha! Prepare to
  be thought at. Leela, give me a topic.
- Seriously, I can't think of anything. Gotta find something to make me think. (reading)
  Hardy Boys. (talking) Too easy. (reading) Nancy Drew. (talking) Too hard. Aha! Perfect!
  Bonfire of the Vanities!
- Take that! And that! This sentence I don't understand but take this one!
- Where are we?
- Queequeg, let go of me! I have to kill it!
- Follow him! It's our only way out!
- Excuse me, have you seen a giant brain?
- (shouting) Come on!
- Tou think I'm an oddity? Wait'l you see --
- Hey, Brain-y, think fast!
- Leela, I've got an idea. Stay here with Queequeg.
- Yes! I'm free!  Alright, Brain. Get ready for some electroshock treatment!
- 'Leela cried for her lost love as Fry lay dead under the heavy bookcase. The Big
  Brain laughed in triumph......Then, for no reason, he left Earth forever. The end.  There!  Now
  he''s trapped in a book I wrote: A crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors.'
- I did it!  And it's all thanks to the books at my local library.
- (cheering) Alright!
- He promised he'd give his Uncle Zoid a million bucks to make a movie.
- Since when have you been in the biz?
- Leela, we're missing the premiere. My only goal in life was to attend a Hollywood
  shindig. Just pay the valet the two bucks.
- Well, we missed the premiere and we're gonna die. We might as well enjoy the sights.  Oh
  my God, Sylvester Stallone!
- It's been two weeks. You wanna play tic-tac-toe again before we eat our shoes?
- What was that? A tar dolphin or a tar shark?
- Alright, but I still feel like having a shoe.
- We made it! I'm at a Hollywood party!
- Controversial?
- Alright, she's all restocked with emergency jam. Let's get going.
- Bender?
- No fair. Leela was training me to be captain. She even let me sit in her lap and
  steer - in this comic I drew.
- I am at ease.
- Would you cram a sock in it Bender? Those aren't even medals! They're bottlecaps
  and pepperoni slices.
- Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender! He's the best......at being a big jerk
  and his big ugly face is as dumb as a butt.
- If I were in charge I wouldn't treat you like this. You're nothing but a big blowhard.
- Being captain is obviously more important to you than being my friend. I'm going.
- What's happening?
- Oh the fools! If only they'd built it with 6001 hulls! When will they learn?
- You ate most of them. So, where's Captain Bender? Off catastrophising some other
  planet?
- He didn't?
- Wait. Let me. Bender and I have our disagreements, but we're still friends and I'm
  gonna show him what that means. To the ship.
- Madam, I am in command now.
- Then where are we? You said you knew how to navigate.
- Granted. We can't take off without our captain.
- So Leela, were you able to help the penguins?
- (mumbling) I 'unno.
- (shouting) C'mon!
- I'll tell you when my horse finishes...bad.
- Come on, come on! Hey Leela, how 'bout a kiss for good luck?  I meant tongue luck.
- I am so unlucky! I've run over black cats that were luckier than me.
- Dear Horse God, I know I don't usually pray to you, sometimes I doubt you even exist.
  But if you're willing to grant me luck, please, stamp your hoof once. Come on number
  six move it!  Don't do that! What are you -  Man it's contagious!
- That's it! You can only take my money for so long before you take it all, and I
  say enough.  I've got one dollar left, and this one I'm holding onto! Oh no you
  don't!  I may not know much about horses but I know a lot about doing anything for
  one dollar!  If you think bad luck can defeat me then you don't know my name is
  Philip J -
- Kareem's got the skyhook but Philip J. Fry's got the spacehook!
- Hey. That's my patented spacehook! You stole it!
- Holy camolie! A seven leaf clover!
- Phil wins! Yancy's fans are stunned! There'll be no celebration at the Yancy dome!
- Pah. I'd have won a lot of money too if I still had my lucky seven leaf clover.
  Plus I'd still have my hair.
- I hid it in a secret hiding place who's location I never told anyone. Not even Scruffy.
- Hey yeah! Maybe it is still there! Underground in the ruins of Old New York. Helping
  some ant defeat another ant or helping some piece of dirt turn it's luck around.
- I'm going down there to get my clover back. Now some of the tunnels have metal bars
  so I'll need someone who's good at bending. Leela how 'bout you?
- It is?
- Here's the entrance.  From this moment on I declare my bad luck officially over.
- Look, up ahead.
- Wow! We've got Manhattan all to ourselves! I can finally do all the crazy stuff
  I always dreamed of doing!  Howard Stern s overrated!  Uh, oops!
- And remember when Mayor Giuliani cracked down on jaywalking?
- Well Rudy, how'd you like this action?
- Cosmic F.
- Outer space.
- The moonwalk...the robot...the zero G!
- Deep space??
- Hey!
- The robot? That's similar to mine!
- What are you doing? You totally ripped off my routine.
- Why do you always have to steal everything from me Yancy? Find your own life and
  live it.
- Well I'd like to see you try and steal this. the septuple head spin.
- Oh yeah? Noticeably F.A.T., rewind the tape.
- Alright team, let's go find that clover!
- 71st street? Hmm, never heard of it. Downtown could be in any direction.
- Gosh my old neighbourhood!  That's the bench where I found some shirts!  That fire
  hydrant! In summer we'd light it on fire! On that corner, some guy with a bushy
  beard handed out a socialist newsletter!
- You'd better believe it!
- That's right.
- Yeah, he was my neighbour. Why?
- Get out of here! What's Andy up to these days?
- Sure when he's sober!
- Holy camolies! The house I grew up in! It's still there!
- Mom! Help!
- Mom, Yancy's trying to steal my clover.
- Not yet commander. Yancy's just trying to steal my stuff as usual.
- The Ronco Record Vault! Yancy'll never get his hands on you in here or my money
  back.  Ah The Breakfast Club soundtrack! Man I can't wait til I'm old enough to
  feel ways about stuff!  Stay safe clover. I may need you again someday.
- This was the storage room. My dad spent years turning it into a bomb shelter.
- This is it! My Ronco Record Vault! I still remember the combination.  Three. It's
  stuck.
- Here it is. The Breakfast Club soundtrack.
- I hid my seven leaf clover in this very record jacket so my brother Yancy wouldn't
  get it.  Here goes.  It's gone!  the whole place has been cleaned out! Yancy stole
  my clover! That thief!
- Everything else in here held up OK.
- I don't know why my brother hated me so much.
- You think? 'Cause I always kinda wished that -
- It's my brother Yancy! And there in his lapel - my seven leaf clover! I knew he
  stole it.
- Wait a second! That's my name! Good Lord. He ditched his goofy name and stole mine!
- First person on Mars?? I should have been the first person on Mars! He stole my
  clover, he stole my name and he stole my life!  And now he broke my hand.
- That clover helped my ratfink brother steal my dream of going into space. Now I'll
  never get there.
- I'm Philip J. Fry! He stole my name after I got frozen.
- That should have been me!
- That's my clover! Yancy stole it!
- That's what I'm known for!
- So that's where my clover is? Hey, is that orbitting cemetary near here?
- Good. Leela, Bender, we're going graverobbing.
- I should be the one in that grave!
- Hmm. We lost Bender.
- Aha! My brother's grave!
- It's all lies every word of it! He wasn't original, he wasn't a Martian, he wasn't
  Philip Fry and since when is he a the?
- It's clovering time!
- (reading) Here lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle, to carry on his spirit.
- Aww. That's terrible, Leela. But imagine the look on their faces when you show up
  with two friends who eat all the hors d'oeuvres.
- Eww!
- Mmm! The gristle-in-a-blanket isn't half bad.
- I don't see you anywhere.
- Sure haven't.
- (thoughtful) Really?
- Hey, why are those kids following you? Do you have candy stuck to your ass?
- You guys are crazy. Leela doesn't need surgery. You look great the way you are.
- But you're better than normal, you're abnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn't care
  what other people think.
- Bah! I think she looked fine before.
- This is so unfair! I liked you back when you were a cyclops! That guy's only interested
  now that you have two eyes.
- No, I'm not! Oh, wait, I am. But my point remains valid!
- 'What''s so wonderful about Leela being normal? The rest of us aren''t normal and
  that''s what makes us great. Like Dr. Zoidberg: He''s a weird monster who smells
  like he eats garbage and does.'
- And the professor's a senile, amoral crackpot.  Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant.
- Amy's a klutz from Mars.
- I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna be like us? Or do you wanna be like Adlai
  with no severe mental or social problems whatsoever?
- You are a calculator.
- There goes my new kitchen cabinets.
- Yay!
- It's good to have the old weird-looking Leela back.
- Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything.
- (unenthusiastic) Huzzah!
- Oh, no, I'm boned! I haven't paid into the pension either. What'll I do when I retire?
- Hey, I don't see you planning for your old age.
- Well I'm gonna take action. It's time to check on my retirement fund.  Damn! Still
  only $100.
- He's right! I've gotta start investing wisely.
- Well, I'm down to my last lottery ticket. Cherry.  Cherry!  Mule. Crud!
- (shrugging) You gotta spend money to make money.
- I sure do! That's the real robber and I'll never forget his name as long as I live.
  And that name is--
- You're right. You're right. It was--
- "I refuse to testify on the grounds that my organs will be chopped up into a patt\xE9\
  ."
- (from box) Ow! My head! Ow! My feet! Ow! My head! Ow! My feet!
- (from box) Ow! My chin!
- I don't belong here, Bender. This is an asylum for insane robots!
- Oh, good, a physical! Once they examine my fragile, naked, pink body, they'll see
  I'm not a--
- What the--?
- Look! There's been a terrible mistake. I'm a human being. See?  I'm all squishy
  and flabby. Also, I complain a lot.
- I do other human stuff! I age! See?
- The car dealer? Wow! I guess his prices really were insane.
- Actually, we've met once before.
- My roommate exploded. Oh, you gotta help me, Bender. How can I prove I'm human?
- I don't wanna!
- You do?
- 'Let me guess: He thinks he''s Lincoln?'
- Bender, I can't take much more of this! I want outta here!
- But I'm not a robot like you. I don't like having discs crammed into me. Unless
  they're Oreos - and then only in the mouth! Don't you understand? I'm gonna die
  here!
- You gotta get me out of here. I would have starved to death if not for that sick
  vending machine robot.  Gimmie! Gimmie!
- At least I have friends on the outside. Bender's been no help at all.
- (shouting) Help me! For God's sake, help me!
- (sleep-talking) Thirty days hath September, April, June and ... wonder ... is that
  peanut butter ... what am I gonna do? (talking) Oh, God! What? What? What is it
  now?
- Finally! Sweet justice! Sweet, juicy justice!
- Roberto! W-W-W-What are you doing here?
- Why would you hold up the same bank twice?
- N--, n--, n--
- No! Please! Help! Stop it! Please!
- I'm not a robot! (shouting) I'm not a robot!
- (mechanical voice) Affirmative. I feel nothing. I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep ...
- (mechanical voice) Negative. I must be a robot. Why else would human women refuse
  to date me?
- (mechanical voice) Bio-units, terminate noise exchange. It is time for you to ingest
  sandwiches from my compartment.
- Oh, you sad, worthless human.
- Fear not! For I shall assist ye!
- Relax, mammal. My robotic software shall meet your calculatory needs.  What is the
  meaning of this symbol?
- I'll show ye!
- Stand back. I'm a tool-bot.
- Yes, I am. I simply haven't discovered my primary function yet.
- Beep.
- (drunk) Alcohol fuels my power cells. And as a mighty robot, I--  Beep.
- Halt, fellow robot!
- The side that kicks your twisted, metal ass!
- 'Negative, bossy meat creature. I know now what my primary function is: I am a battle-droid.
  Sworn to protect the weak from crazy robots.'
- No knife can penetrate my skin-tanium armour.
- (mechanical voice) It was nothing. I-- (normal) Blood? Robots don't have blood.
  I must be a, a--
- A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human!
- I'm gonna continue never washing this cheek again.
- Aw. Thanks, Bender.
- Oh my God! They dug up a bag of olestra chips from my time!  There must be layers
  and layers of old stuff down there.
- No, it's an old Volkswagen van.  (shouting) Hey, Mister? Mind if I take this old
  van?
- Yeah yeah, I've gotten used cars before.
- It's called a van, and in light of the fact that it's not a-rockin', I invite you
  to come a-knockin'!
- No, it can't, but it's got a driver's-side floor and an 8-track player with genuine
  mono sound.
- Under the seat.
- It just needs some gas.
- Like what?
- Oh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up your inhibition unit and makes you sing folk
  songs.
- Bender, if you don't open that can right now, your fear will own you, and nothing
  that can opener could ever do could be worse than that.
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no, this is terrible.
- Wait a minute, Bender is my best friend. We can't just dump him in the gutter like
  Grandma's ashes.
- No, why?
- Aw, you look so sad. You want me to send Patch Cord Adams back in?
- Hey, I have an idea. Who wants to cram in my van and follow Bender on tour and live
  there, in the van?
- Yeah, I like it.
- Oh yeah!
- Mine too, even my change.
- Surprise!
- Wow, I forgot about TV. Living free on the road, you realise how much better life
  is without it. Well, let's see what's on.
- Yeah!
- Bender, you can move! You're cured!
- Bender, I don't claim to understand "the biz" but wouldn't being able to move help
  your music career?
- Brothers and sisters, get your love beads. Can't journey to the centre of your mind
  without love beads!
- (shouting) Bender rules!
- Hurry, the Golden Gate Bridge. Put the metal to the pedal to the other metal.
- Is any of that a problem?
- Phew!
- (shouting) C'mon, Bender. If you're done scamming Beck, we're heading home.
- So, Leela, how about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats? They're kinda dangerous
  but I finally mastered them.
- Oh. That explains these boat eggs.
- (shouting) What happens if we lose?
- Hey, Leela. Look at me!
- There's a lot about my face you don't know. Perhaps you and it could get better
  acquainted over dinner.
- C'mon, Leela, why won't you go out with me? We both know there's something there.
- What's happening?
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, put me in, professor. I wanna show Leela my skills.
- Who cares? We're 35 points ahead with two minutes left. What could possibly -
- Is that a problem?
- You mean we just -
- Psst, Leela. I've set up a time-proof shelter in the closet. There's only room for
  two, and you're the one I wanna share it with.
- (sexfully) Because when we're together in here, baby, time will stand still.
- Ow.
- Hooray for Leela!
- Leela, I want you to know I think the way you moved those stars around was really
  wonderful. I got you something.
- You deserve it. I mean, nobody ever stops to tell you what a great captain you are.
- You're smart, you're beautiful, and best of all, you'll go out with me-ee?
- I got her champagne, I opened it. What does a guy have to do?
- Hmm. Maybe this is the moment to show her my real surprise.
- Look. I've been studying how to pilot the ship. Impressed?
- I learned how to work the gravity pump too. In case we need to move more stars.
  So are we dating now?
- Look, Leela. I know there's some perfect, amazing thing I can do to make you love
  me, and when I figure out what it is -
- Of course not.
- No! Drugs are for losers and hypnosis is for losers with big, weird eyebrows. I
  don't know what amazing thing I did you make you love me but, whatever it was, we're
  married now. We've got the rest of our lives to work -
- What?
- Fine. Break my heart again.
- How did I do it? How did I get Leela to love me? I've got to figure it out.
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- Oh, it's hopeless. I did something so great that it won Leela's heart and I'll never,
  ever know what it was. My life is empty.
- Leela, about the wedding. I don't know what I did to make you love me, and I don't
  think I tricked you into it, but maybe I did. And if I did, I'm sorry.
- Yeah. But I don't guess anything I could do will ever make you feel the same way
  about me that I do about you.
- She's so great. I feel like I can almost remember the magical thing I did to make
  her love me. But I guess I never will.
- Oh!  That's how I must have done it! I moved the stars themselves to write her a
  love note in the sky.
- (screaming) Nooo!  Did you see it? Did you see it?
- No, not the explosion!
- (quietly) Nothing.
- I just saw something incredibly cool. A big floating ball that lit up with every
  colour of the rainbow, plus some new ones that were so beautiful I fell to my knees
  and cried.
- Yeah.
- Well I don't care if it was some dork in a costume. For one brief moment I felt
  the heartbeat of creation. And it was one with my own.
- How can you people be so blase? Here you are in the year 3000 or so, yet you just
  sit around like its the boring time I came from.
- Yeah. But now its the distant future. Why aren't we out doing everything I ever
  dreamed of?
- (sexfully) Everything?
- Yeah, what did they ever do for me?
- I wanna see the edge of the universe!
- Far out! So, there's an infinite number of parallel universes?
- Oh, well, I'm sure that's enough.
- (shouting) Yeehah! Bow before your master, puny mortals! Whoo! Giddy-up! Ha ha!
  Woohoo! Whoopie!
- That was fun. Let's give him a treat!
- The tongue tickles.
- These new hands are great. I'm gonna break them in tonight.
- 'I''ve only got two fantasies left: Be invisible in a chocolate factory and be romantically
  linked with a celebrity.'
- OK.
- It is?
- Download a celebrity from the internet? What part of that do I understand?
- Hey, I have an idea. Let's do that!
- Ooo! eBay!
- So where's the celebrity dating place?
- Nah. I read in Newsweek that she drinks human blood.
- I'd prefer someone from the era of shaved underarms. Do you have anything with a
  more Lucy Liu feel to it?
- I'd like the 2003 model.
- Wahoo! I've found her! What do I do now?
- It worked!
- (muffled) It worked perfectly!
- Did you hear that? She likes me!
- But this is Lucy Liu! Perhaps the only good actress of the 21st century! She's more
  than just a piece of software.
- Uh, not right now.
- So uh, what do you feel like doing?
- I said later!
- Then when I feel so stuffed I can't eat anymore, I just use the restroom, and then
  I can eat more.
- Oh Lucy! You're just like I always thought you'd be from your movies.
- You're cute!
- You!
- You!
- You!
- Well, so what if I love a robot? It's not hurting anybody.
- This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has a vampire and an explosion!
- Aww, you guys came to watch me make out! That is so sweet.  Wait a minute! Is that
  the head of who I think it's of?
- Let me see.  Yep. Why do you ask?
- Sorry laides, employees only.
- Lucy Liubot, if I don't survive the corn I want you to know that I love you as much
  as a man can love a computerised image of gorgeous celebrity. Which it turns out
  is a lot.
- What are you doing darling? Get down!
- You saved us. Are you alright?
- What?? No!
- But I just downloaded her because I love you.
- I'm sorry. Hug me Liubot.
- Uh huh. And I guess now maybe I can get to know the real Lucy Liu.
- But, but!
- I've never seen a supernova blow up. But if it's anything like my old Chevy Nova,
  it'll light up the night sky!
- OK.
- Let's go microwave, I'm in a hurry here! Hm?  Hey, what smells like blue?
- Hey, which crazy thing happening are you guys screaming about?
- Ooo my popcorn's done!
- Aw, it's less popped than ever.
- We're gonna crash!
- Bender, are you OK?
- Yo!
- My God! This mean the flying saucer that crashed in Roswell...was...us!
- Hey, and while we're on the base I'll visit my grandfather Enos! He was stationed
  at Roswell.
- Got it.
- But existing is basically all I do!
- It's him! It's my grandfather Enos.
- That jeep's gonna hit him! And I won't exist anymore!  Are you crazy? You almost
  got yourself run over!
- That's it! This place is too dangerous. We've gotta get you out of here!  Everything's
  gonna be alright Dad!
- Thank God I got you off that dangerour army base!
- Yowza! I know what I want for dessert!
- Grandma Mildred?! Uh, no dessert, just coffee.
- Eh she sure is pretty. You ought to marry her and father some children right away!
- What?? Don't ever say or think that again! Please. Just concentrate on staying alive!  Fire!
  Look out!  Oh! You almost got neutered.
- For me it is!  I'm getting you out of here!
- OK, we're in the middle of nowhere, which is the safest part of nowhere. Just stay
  put and enjoy this calendar.
- Safe and sound! Finally I can continue to exist!
- Well, I killed my grandfather.
- I dunno. Maybe God loves me.
- Aww. There there. If it makes you feel any better, his body was vapourised so there's
  no chance of him coming back as a zombie.
- Then you're a braver woman than I.
- Uh, how far is it?
- Aww I know how you feel. My grandfather died recently.
- Hey, you know what always cheers you up? Baking me a nice tray of sugar cookies!
- I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't even exist. But I do which proves...you can't really
  be my grandm -
- Relax! She can't be my grandmother! I figured it all out.
- It's impossible! I mean, if she's my grandmother, who's my grandfather?
- But...but won't that change history?
- Take this Mr President, sir!
- Yay!
- Turn around. We've gotta go back for Bender!
- Oh, poor Bender. He must be so lonely right now. Trapped a thousand years in the
  past. Hey! Wait a second!
- No.  Wait!
- He's alive!  Bender. What was it like lying in that hole for a thousand years?
- Just as well. I'm getting tired of this wood show.
- Alright!
- 'These letters are real butt-nutters! Listen to this one: (reading) Dear Santa.'
- It's not fair. In my day Xmas was supposed to bring people together, not blow them
  apart!
- Certainly yes us! Uh-huh, sir! We've gotta bring back the kind of Xmas I remember.
- Uh, look, we've got mail for Santa. Are you his elves?
- But you live in a gingerbread house.
- That's it! I'm gonna deliver a gift of my boot up Santa's chimney. Where is he?
- Faster! Faster!
- Why aren't we moving?
- He's trapped!
- And I can deliver them. Billions and billions in one night.
- Evil Knievel could!
- (singing) Which is good because we don't intend to pay.
- (singing) These toys soldiers are poorly painted,
- Ah! Bathtub eggnog! Just the way Grandma used to drink.  Ew! It went sour!
- Oh, no! The ice is melting!
- And your breezy short-shorts!
- Hurry! We've gotta think of another way to save Bender or Xmas will be ruined!
- I'm Santa Claus!
- Your Mayorness, if you execute him, you have to execute all of us.
- This is horrible.
- Don't do it! He's evil!
- Wait a second! Maybe your futuristic Xmas isn't so rotten after all.
- But don't you see? Fear has brought us together. That's the magic of Xmas!
- Kinda gamey.
- Speaking of which, try these nachos.
- He's dead.
- Ooo I have one. I'm good at video games and bad at everything else. That's why I
  wish life were more like a video game.
- Uh, What if that thing I said?
- Wait a second, I know that monkey. His name is Donkey.
- Well sir, I spent all of ninth grade studying them. Except for that day when my
  eyeballs started to bleed. And in my opinion.
- Hey watch out!
- Its OK, I had another guy!
- Alright, its Saturday night. I have no date, a two litre bottle of Shasta, and my
  all Rush mix tape! Let's rock!
- I've still got a trick or two up my sleeve. Watch as I fire up through our own shields.
- Amy, tend to the widow pac-man.
- What do you monsters want?
- I guess so.
- Ow!
- OK crow, prepare to be scared.  And then - honk honk - the car honked it's own horn!
- Hey, that's not a nice thing to say.
- Man, we've been skipping for hours. I need to pull over and take the wiz.
- That's great Leela.
- Why does everyone keep saying that?
- Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.
- Never mind Professor, she came to.
- Whoa! Letters like "U" and "R" can mean words like "You" and "Are." Here Leela,
  U-R-2 Cute!
- I've never been able to put into words how I feel about you. But somewhere among
  these trillions of hearts, those words must already exist. And I'm gonna find them.
- And you got a cage for the lion!
- Before we deliver these hearts, I'm gonna find the one that sums up my feelings
  for you!  "I Love You." Hmm, too conventional. "You're My Man." Ooo so close!
- Whoa!
- Maybe we hit a space cow.
- Wow Bender. Are you and the ship an item? I mean I know you're both items but...how
  can you date a ship anyway? It'd be like me dating a really fat lady. And living
  inside her. And she'd be all like...
- The ship? But you just started dating.
- You have much to teach us.
- Planet Express Ship? Is that you?
- Uh, um no. I think he's at his parent's.
- Bender? No! He's an old fashioned one spaceship robot. Look I'll tell him you stopped
  by OK?
- Incoming torpedoes. Shields at maximum yarnell.
- You couldn't have picked a better time to dump the ship Bender!
- What's happening? Space cow?
- Ha! That barely hurt Leela at all!
- Same as everyday, got it.
- I'm on it. And maybe I'll find those magic words while I'm at it.
- Eh.  Blech!  Eurgh! Ooo how 'bout this one?
- Um, Leela?
- Bender! Are you OK?
- Well I guess we'd better clean up these millions of hearts.
- Sure. We talk about it all the time.
- No. Burn!
- What does it taste like?
- If those aren't tears of happiness, please stop crying.
- Is it this room that's making you sad? It's probably the room. Come on, lets go
  for a walk.
- Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.
- Then today's your lucky day because I happen to be a holding, stroking, lovin' machine!
  Also spankin'!
- Well, anyway, just remember that people care about you.
- Yo yo, Bezender! What up?
- No fair!
- It's like that time I peeked in the kitchen at Imperial Hunan.
- What happened?
- That's when we saved Earth from a giant asteroid of garbage.
- (whispering) Dude! Over here!
- And also - for some reason - the letter I wrote you full of my personal feelings.
- Leela, freak out later. We're not done escaping yet!
- Ow!
- (whispering) Shut up, you two! We can kill ourselves when we get home!
- Come on Leela. You can do it!
- Whoa! What are you doing?
- Leela's going nuts and I can't save her unless I learn more about her mysterious
  past. Isn't there anything else you can tell me?
- That's impossible because my time is worthless!
- Hand it over.
- Look, I'm trying to save someone here. I'll have to come back for those later.
- Can you translate it?
- I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse. I asked you to get busy.
- Isn't that the same machine that makes noses?
- Is it done?
- Stop!  Thanks Bender! Don't do it Leela!
- Close.
- I had the Professor analyse the alienese letter that was found with you.
- I 'unno. But the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper. A squeezably
  soft paper used mainly in the sewers.
- So what's Mars Day about, anyway?
- Lighten up, Leela. It's funny!
- I'll have a thorax and some feelers.
- Yuck!
- What's that weird sound?
- Aw, man!
- Yee-haw!
- Where?
- Oh. Oh!
- Where?
- Pfft, that's not scary!
- Hook on the hand!
- Man in the attic!
- With pleasure. (spookily) Once, not far from here, four people set out on a cattle
  drive--
- And then, while they sat helplessly around the campfire ... a demented knife-wielding
  escaped lunatic libertarian zombie mutant snuck up and--
- Hey, it's that "barbecue's over" sound again.
- Where?
- My God!
- Also, I didn't know buggalo could fly.
- Hm.
- Yeah!
- Wait. That's the bead you traded your land for?
- Hey! Now what am I supposed to watch and drink all day?
- Well there's the material rewards.
- Happy funeral Bender!
- We just wanted to show you that you really will be remembered.
- Dearly beloved, we are here today to remember Bender, taken from us in the prime
  of life, when he was crushed by a runaway semi, driven by the Incredible Hulk.
- Now let us each remember the best things about Bender in our own way. Professor?
- 'Yes there is Bender. Bender was a lot of things to a lot of people, but looking
  back, the number one thing I can say about him is this, and simply this: Bender
  was my friend.'
- I thought something looked different in here.
- Hi, we have a giant stone to deliver - sign here.
- Call it a hunch but, I've got a bad feeling about this.
- You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work but they don't
  pay you or let you go.
- Incredible. This place is just like the Ancient Egypt of my day.
- 'I knew it! Insane theories: one! Regular theories: a billion!'
- Also Wolfman!
- Yeah, remember who your real friends are.
- Can you believe it? Pharaoh's dead!
- I'm gonna spin til I fall down!
- You know what else stinks about being a slave? The hours.
- Hey, I think I know who the next Pharaoh is!
- Bender, I really hope that's you. 'Cause if it isn't......we're in trouble!
- What proof is this? Some huge number?
- Bend-er? Doesn't ring a bell.  Did you hear something Leela?
- Hey Leela you know who I remember...?
- '...That guy who used to bend things. You know...?'
- '...Hermes.'
- Absolutely.
- Space pirates?
- Come on, come on.
- Firing torpedo number three!
- Go after him Leela!
- You mean we can never catch up to him? Not even if we rub the engine with cheetah
  blood?
- (solemn) He always wanted to drift forever. But through the American Southwest.
- Can you find him Professor?
- No that's I don't -
- Well, I guess that sounds OK.
- What? Really?
- He decided not to let go.  I can't believe you're gone. I won't! If I can't reach
  you physically, I'll just have to try something desperately crazy!
- So that's my story Father Changstein el Gamahl. Is there anything religion can do
  to help me find my friend?
- Uh-huh but is there anything useful we can do?
- Bonder? Is it really you?
- Wait a minute. Bender's name isn't Bonder, it's Bender. You're a fraud!
- Only if you don't have any real hope.
- I've not heard of them.
- You think they'd let me use it to look for Bender?
- Sir, I'm outfitting an expedition to a monestary high in the Himalayas. I'll need
  a long sleeved coat.
- You can't give up hope just because it's hopeless. You gotta hope even more and
  cover your ears and go "blah blah blah blah blah blah blah!"  (shouting) I'd also
  like a pack mule.
- OK.
- And then what?
- Hmm, finding God, that - that's important, yeah. But you know what might be a treat
  for everyone? If you let me use the telescope to find my lost friend Bender.
- Aw c'mon, you guys have forever to look for God. All I'm asking is one measley lifetime
  to find my friend.
- That telescope is as much mine as it is anybody's. I'm using it whether you give
  me permission or not.
- Bender? Bender?
- Hello? Has anyone out there seen Bender?
- (sadly) You're right. I'm never gonna see him again. I know he was evil and on more
  than one occasion he, he actually stole my blood.  But still, I wish I had Bender
  back.
- Bender! It's a miracle!  Ow!
- We climbed a mountain and locked up some monks.
- Do we have to? I mean they're monks. I'm sure their God will let them out or at
  least give them more shoes to eat.
- Ooo, a bot-mitzvah. Shalom hunger, shalom free food!
- So what's the deal? You guys don't believe in Robot Jesus?
- This is perfect for me.
- Boneitis? Pft! That's a funny name for a horrible disease.
- Y'know that dance wasn't as safe as they said it was.
- No question.
- They're scared of our raw power. Oh but if you want a job, I could beg everyone
  at the company where I work.
- I nominate That Guy. Not just because he has a suit but because he knows about business
  and stuff and he has a tie. My shares still count if they went through the washing
  machine right?
- I'm rollin' up the corporate ramp.
- No thanks I make my own.
- No we're not. And as vice chairman, I believe I speak for the entire board when
  I issue this challenge to Mom. Look at my butt!
- Woo yeah! Hit him hit him hit him! Now this is the high life! Watching apes mangle
  each other near celebrities!
- Uh, work really really hard?
- Oh thank God!
- This company's on the fast track to the It List! Blast back kudos all around!
- Yes I did Leels! And I'll tell you why. Because it grows the brand.
- Tonight, that's us!
- Make it two. And a glass of all your water.
- Don't you worry about "blank" let me worry about "blank."
- I'm on it. But if you need me you know where I'll be.
- Don't you worry about Planet Express. Let me worry about blank!
- What? I haven't changed.  Suz? Have I changed?
- Thanks doll.
- You're right Professor. We might not be a traditional family like the Murphy's next
  door or the lesbian coven across the street but we are a family, and That Guy understands
  that.
- Uh Ms Johnson? Please bring in some more chair fuel.
- I had no idea the company would be sold. I was just an innocent suck up. You've
  gotta believe me!
- Ms Johnson, you've never lied to me. Am I still a good person?
- I've got to redeem myself. Somehow, sometime, for some reason. I'll block this takeover!
- Believe it or not, I have more important things to do today than laugh and clap
  my hands.  Reschedule.
- '...So I ask you, as a friend, won''t you stop this deal?'
- Oh my God! His boneitis!
- He's dead.
- I don't think so. 'Cause as vice chairman of the company I gain voting control of
  his shares.
- I'll be whatever I wanna do! That Guy was the greatest businessman that ever lived
  and before his mysterious death he taught me everything he knew.  But some things
  I had to learn myself. I learned that money is fine but in the end what counts is
  people... ...People you love... ...You can't put a price on that... So I'm giving
  up control of the company... ...to a man of enourmous experience... ...Professor...
  ...Hubert Farnsworth.
- You mean you'd rather be rich than work together?
- In my whole life this company was the only place I ever really felt at home. If
  being millionaires is more important to you than our...
- '...friendship, then I''ll sell Planet Express, for you.'
- It is? Yahoo! We're poor no matter what I do! The deal is off!
- Look, so we're not millionaires. At least we all still get to work together!
- I know, and I've grown to accept that. Now I'm more interested in that new pizza
  parlour across the street. Kinda makes me pine for my days as a pizza delivery boy.
  "Here's you pizza," I'd say. "I didn't order any," they'd say. And then I'd be off
  to my next adventure.
- Uh, hmm, do you have any food?
- Hey hey, what's wrong? Was it something Leela said?
- Aww, don't cry foreign people. I used to work in a pizzeria and as soon as I stop
  hallucinating and blasting puke, I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza - Earth style!
- 'For starters, only use quality ingredients. Case in point: No more live bees.  Oregano
  works equally well. And when you put pizzas in the oven, don''t get in with them.'
- Most important of all is the big screen TV. Human families need a TV when they're
  eating so they don't have to talk to each other.  Ah, the Earthican pasttime, blernsball!
- Well if you're going to be Earthicans we'll have to teach you. How about your pizzeria
  plays a game against Planet Express? Oh but you'll need nine players.
- Leela, you beaned a run-in. You'd better let me pitch.
- Wow, I must say I'm impressed. You look just like a ball player. Can I pat you on
  the butt?
- Ohh, now I'm too nervous.
- (shouting) Go Leela!
- Hey look! The player's who broke the various colour barriers!
- And here he is trying to make a catch with an oven mit.
- Hank Aaron XXIV? How could you play so blowfully? The original Hank Aaron was great!
- Leela could beat that. She's pitched her whole career without getting an out.
- (whispering) Psst, you're holding the bat upside down.
- Hooray!
- Hey! You opened a franchise!
- (shouting) Strike him out Leela! Do it for the hundreds of women everywhere!
- Hey, uh, what's with all the pots and pans? You building a wife?
- Brunch. Right. I'd better warn - tell - warntell the others!
- Brace yourselves. Bender is making us brunch.
- He's so proud of his awful cooking. If we don't eat it he'll be crushed.
- Hurry!
- Uh, with you blocking the only escape route? Don't be silly!
- '...but this food actually tastes better as vomit!'
- What up?
- (singing) I'm walking on sunshine! La la la la sunshine!
- What?!
- Well, I don't remember any of that but I don't have the wherewithal to defend myself.
- There you go.
- (shouting) Yeah you show 'em!
- Yo, hook me up. My turkey is dry and I've tried everything.  Oh right. Never mind.
- Yay!
- Ah, so the real gift Spargle gave you was confidence. The confidence to be your
  best.
- You know what movies average out to be really good? The first six Star Trek movies!
- What words? Star Trek?
- She's all yours, buddy!
- Mr. Nimoy, I came as soon as I heard what happened centuries ago. I can't believe
  your show was banned.
- You know? 1966? 79 episodes, about 30 good ones.
- Come on! Remember that episode where you go high on spores and smacked Kirk around?
- Aha! You can't escape it!
- Uh, jeez, don't get upset. I mean, OK I outwitted you, but--
- I'm literally angry with rage! Your co-stars may be gone but we can still get those
  episode tapes back for the whole world to see. Come on!
- But we have to! The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future.
- '''Cause it-it taught me so much. Like how you should accept people, whether they
  be black, white, Klingon or even female. But most importantly, when I didn''t have
  any friends, it made me feel like maybe I did.'
- Oh, dip!
- It's all stuff from that forbidden show.
- Welshy?
- I can't believe it! How'd you all end up here?
- Say it in Russian!
- Now say "nuclear wessels"!
- (screaming) Welshy!
- Alright, you gas, what's the deal?
- Tremble? I laugh. Nobody knows more about Star Trek than me!
- Cool! A Star Trek convention!
- Uh ... Khan?
- You have my fan script?
- (smug) Oh, I was confused because the scoreboard says something different.
- Not 'til I get my 600 quatloos!
- This is wrong. We shouldn't have abandoned them there.
- Well, usually on the show someone would come up with a complicated plan then explain
  it with a simple analogy.
- Of course! It's so simple!
- Like a balloon and ... something bad happens.
- Great list. Except, you forgot episode 66!
- And we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows and arrows.
- Well, here goes nothing.
- It hurts!
- All this time we thought he was a powerful super-being, yet he was just a child.
- Bender, wait! This is our chance to escape, before Melllvar comes back. But we all
  need to work together.
- We've decided to work together.
- Stop! You're just goin' around in circles! (to himself) Think, Fry, think! Everyone's
  depending on you.
- Look, Leonard, we're light enough to keep the tapes! Isn't that great?
- We did it!
- Melllvar's got a spaceship!
- Wait! If they mean that much to you, why do you wanna kill them?
- 'Melllvar, you can''t let a TV show be your whole life. You can do anything you
  want. Look at Walter Koenig: After Star Trek, he became an actor.'
- Whoa, whoa! One step at a time.
- Episode 10, Balance Of Terror.
- And all you had to put up with was one really annoying Star Trek fan.
- Man it's hot! (different voice.) How hot is it? (normal voice.) It's so hot I poured
  McDonalds Coffee in my lap to cool off.  Jonny Carson said it.
- Wait! Where do we get the ice?
- Wow! Mining a comet, that sounds fun!
- Wow! That ice dispenser's so big, the ice crushes you!  Yakov Smirnov said it!
- Oh my God! It's out of ice! Like some outer space Motel 6!
- Bender? Are you crying?
- What? I've seen you get up off your back tons of times.
- Good for him!
- Professor, you're a Professor. You must have some ideas.
- Professor no, don't do it!
- That's awful Professor. Especially the making out part.
- Be brave my friend.
- Ah ha!
- Wait. We could hide you! We'll pile fruit on you and claim you're a bowl.
- I won't let you.
- Bender, this world isn't good enough for you.
- Why isn't this working?!
- Amazing! That's why they call you "Bender The Magnificent"!
- Whoa! They discovered an intact, 20th Century pizzeria! Just like the one I used
  to work at!
- Lets go check it out. You can see how I lived before I met you.
- Sure. Lots of people did.
- Wait a second! This is Panucci's! I used to work in this exact pizzeria! And for
  your information lady, this was not just used to paddle my butt, it was also used
  to move pizzas and crush rats.
- Don't wave your fancy degrees at me. I recognise all this stuff.  Petrified sausages,
  Old Mr Patelli, and that's -
- Pizza delivery for Mr......Seymour Asses.
- I wouldn't count on it.
- Aww. Poor little guy. You look like you haven't eaten in a month. Here......but
  if Mr Panucci asks, your name is Seynour Asses!  I like you Seymour, you're not
  constantly judging me like all the other dogs - are you? Nah. We understand each
  other.  People think you're a dumb mutt who smells bad, can't find a girlfriend
  and has a crummy job. But you're keepin' it real and call no man "Mister."  Well
  goodbye.  Live long and prosper.
- No! That's my dog in there! It's an outrage I say!
- I'm taking him home and I'd like to see anyone try and stop me.  Uh-oh!
- Ow, oo ow, oo ah!
- Well it's not right to make my dead pet an exhibit. That's like digging up Lassie
  and putting her on display in the Louvre.
- I know, I was deliberately describing a similar situation.
- You're right.  I'll give it a shot!
- Seymour, cleanup!  Good dog!
- 'He''s so cute! He can do two things at one time: Eat and swim. Ooo - three things.'
- So do I get Seymour back? Are you caving to political pressure?
- His name was Seymour. He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering saxaphonist.
  He had wet dog smell, even when dry. And he was not above chasing the number 29
  bus.
- Seymour!
- Good news everyone!
- Which means...we can clone it! Seymour will live again!
- Can you believe it Bender? I'm going to have my best friend back!
- So will Seymour remember how to sing Walking On Sunshine?
- I'm gonna get my puppy back! In your face, Grim Reaper!
- But I'm celebrating New Years Eve.
- I won't be gone long Seymour. Just wait here 'til I come back.
- Hello? Pizza delivery for......Icy Wiener?! Aw crud! I always thought at this point
  in my life I'd be the one making the crank calls!  Here's to another lousy Millenium.  What
  the?
- That's for Seymour.
- Oh that's also for Seymour. I'm getting everything ready for when he's cloned.
- Hey he was smart. He could fetch.
- He could dig up bones.
- Look Bender, this has nothing to do with you.
- Now if you'll excuse me I'm working on Seymour's doghouse.
- Are you two gonna be done soon?
- Well could you do it some place else? I'm setting up Seymour's doggy bed.
- Ah there, perfect!
- Finally!
- Come on boy! Come back to life!
- What? I'm in the middle of something.
- Bender, enough! Leave me alone!
- I hate you! I hate you! You evil metal man!  Ow!
- May yet? Really?
- So Seymour might still exist?
- Then I'm goin' in after him.
- He'd come after me.
- Then all hope is lost.  Goodbye Seymour.
- This is all my fault. I let my best friend risk his life just to get my dead dog
  back.  Bender!!
- Yeah!
- 15? You mean he lived for 12 more years after I got frozen?
- Stop the cloning.
- Think about it. Seymour lived a full life after I was gone. He probably added new
  songs to his repertoire.
- I had Seymour 'til he was three. That's when I knew him and that's when I loved
  him.  I'll never forget him. But he forgot me a long long time ago.
- "How 'bout L\xF6brau? It has dots on it."
- I can't drink that! The metal shavings make my throat bloody.
- No I'm...doesn't.
- The address was on Dogdoo 8 but the universe ends right after Dogdoo 7!
- No, you have a healthy glow.
- I hope it's a lager so I can take it to a ball game.  Ooo! I felt that one!
- We don't work for you anymore!
- Yes sir!
- There. One million papers. Folded and loaded!
- Hurry Leela, get some coasters and cold mugs.
- Push Bender push!
- Almost there. Just two more bottles.
- It's an ale! 5 gallons, 6 ounces!
- Hey wait a second. How did you deliver a million papers in one hour?
- 'There''s no denying it: The future''s crazy! Oh, well. Don''t wanna stand out.'
- So, what is Freedom Day? Sounds like some kind of feminine hygiene product.
- Wow! Nude hot-tubbing? That's all I need to hear about Freedom Day!
- (shouting) We're not listening!
- Anyone who laughs is a Communist!
- They sure hate Dr. Zoidberg.
- Where are we ever going to find a lawyer to take his case?
- Who are you, old man?
- I'll never remember that.
- Wait, you're a lawyer? You're hired!
- You OK there in the embassy, Zoidberg?
- Ow!
- I'm no good at being a slave. I'm thinking about graduate school. Y'know? To become
  a barber?
- Hey, wait! I'm having one of those things. You know? A headache with pictures?
- Back in my day, we didn't have your fancy all-digital weapons but we still managed
  to kill each other just fine.
- Not big enough. We need something that can take out an entire army. Something you
  could commit a war crime with--
- You haven't won yet, Moivin! You didn't expect us to even go to a museum, much less
  steal this ancient heat-seeking missile.
- Zoidberg, how could you? I used to think you were cool.
- Over here!
- Dude hold up! Remember when Zapp blew a hole in the ship?
- Kif touched everybody there. Couldn't any one of us be the mother?
- Check it out y'all. Everyone we invited is here.
- So lets open the gifts!
- Hi!
- Congratulations!
- That's birth for you.
- Let's see what tools we'll need.  Uh-huh, Uh-huh,  Uh-huh! Alright, we're all set.
- Those Swedes sure know how to put in almost everything you need.
- I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.
- There's no bus to Jersey City.
- I'm too scared to find my pocket. Here, I'll just take of my pants and give you
  those.
- Maybe we're all wearing magic rings but they're invisible rings so we don't even
  realise it. Also you can't feel the rings.
- Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub into your skin? You'd think it'd be something
  you have to freebase.
- Yup.
- Check.
- Nope!
- Leela, I think you're missing the big picture. When you were a kid what was your
  biggest fantasy?
- 'Whatever. The correct answer is: To be a superhero. We have superpowers and we''re
  Americans. This is our chance.'
- You'll barely regret this!
- Now me and Leela are forming an awesome crime-fighting duo.
- Plus the cream won't give you superpowers, you're a robot.
- Captain Yesterday!
- Wow!
- Sure. I'm listed in the phone book so once I reveal my real name to you along with
  my home address and a copy of my birth certificate -
- From everybody?
- Give several reasons why.
- Or do we...? No I guess not.
- And I can't take life anymore.
- Who's the perp?
- Pack of highly. Got it!
- Uh, Leela, how you gonna meet your folks tomorrow? We've already scheduled the Zookeeper
  for a 9am foiling at the museum.
- Yet the Zookeeper escaped. Thus proving that the deadliest animal of all is the
  Zookeeper!
- Leela, is the person that parrot is mimicking telling the truth by proxy?
- But, should superheroes commit crime? Even to save lives? I need moral guidance.
  Bender?
- Oh no! Our superpower cream is out of itself!
- El zilcho! I'm afraid we're boned.
- Man, this costume is so damn heavy!
- Owww! That...didn't hurt.
- So this is your lair?
- OK, take it easy!
- That seemed unnecessary.
- Oh yeah!
- I guess, as long as you think it's right.
- My God, he's gonna do it! Everybody, seatbelts to maximum buckling.
- Uh, aren't we looking for your gargoyle?
- Ow! It bit me!
- Yup.
- He still sounds sorta old. Sorta real old.
- This is great Professor! We should go out and celebrate!
- But your parents are gross sewer mutants.
- Oh, hello sir. It's a lovely evening you have tonight. Um I'm here to pick up your
  daughter.
- Thanks. These aren't pockets they're just flaps. I put my money in my sock.
- A movie.  A movie ma'am.
- I'd like a sewer burger but without the rat feces.
- We missed the turn, we'll never catch them.
- Yeah!
- Leela you can stop winning now, we won!
- And then, and then, this giant tapeworm tried to play us for chumps but we like
  totally dissed Moose!
- Yay!
- C'mon! Lets go tell Leela so we can grow up together!
- I'll miss you Leela. I'll come ack and visit when I'm all grown up.
- I wanna hear a space story!
- Professy's back!  Eww, you smell like smoking.  And drinking.
- We did it! We're the right ages again!
- I'm sorry you had to give up being a kid Leela.
- The fabulous person!
- Fabulous friends!
- Delivery boy Philip J. Fry reporting for duty.
- What is the meaning of this? We've got a delivery people, let's move, let's move!  Amy?
  Mission profile?  Interesting, interesting. Dr Zoidberg, mission bag?
- What's this? This is the same toy surprise I got last time!  I can't work under
  these conditions. And without me there is no mission. I am the mission!
- Wh-what? You went without me?
- But, but I'm the delivery boy.
- I'm real sorry I missed the mission. I wasn't there and you might have needed me.
- But if I'd been there I -
- L -
- Bender's great.
- Listen Leela, let me make it up by taking you out to dinner tonight.
- Chaz?
- So? I'm just as important as him.  It's just that, the kind of importance I have,
  it doesn't matter if I...don't do it.
- I'm nobody. There are guys in the background with Mary Worth comics who are more
  important than me.
- Um, OK. Let's go bowling.
- Oh jeez, better not let Leela see me.
- You are? So things aren't working out with whatshisname?
- Um..uh...
- Oh no, please, no!  Perfect!
- Wait, I'm trying. It weighs as much as a thousand suns!
- I'm as worthless as this trashcan.
- Oh Nibbler, at least I'm important to you. Even if it's only 'cause I clean up you
  poop.
- D-d-did you just talk?
- Like what?
- Are you my mommy?
- Eh?
- Aww, aren't you a fuzzy wittle guy?
- Mightiness? Are you off your nut? I just got kidnapped by a bunch of guineapigs.
- Oh snap!
- Maybe later.
- Hmm, I remember the square dancing stomachs, although that might have been a milanta
  commerical. Wait! The brains! I do remember! But no one else does. They said I was
  crazy.
- Because I'm so smart?
- I did do the nasty in the pasty!
- So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
- What's so evil about that?
- So they're trying to learn things?
- Those bastards!
- I'm as mad as I've ever been.
- Now it's personal.
- OK, let's go through this once more -
- Aah! Brains!
- Sorry, what? I wasn't paying attention.
- Who?
- I'm at the input console. I'm a little nervous and I've got brain in my buttcrack.
- Hey wait, this brain knows everything about everything right?
- Yeah yeah, but I can't pass up a chance to learn the answers to the greatest questions
  of all time.  Is it true that post-it stamp glue is made up of -
- Wait wait wait.  What really killed the dinosaurs?
- Uh oh.
- Eww gross. Cut it out!
- You got it poindexter!
- Well at least I did one important thing with my life. Leading good to victory over
  evil!
- The day I got frozen? What about it?
- Eh forget it then.
- OK sheesh!  What happened to me, Philip J. Fry, on the night of December 31st 1999?
- Eurgh! I can't believe how fat I look! Aw, Nibbler's there. Wait! What?!
- I, I don't understand. You made me go in the freezer tube?
- You little runts froze me! You took away my life!
- No you can't. Shut your adorable trap!
- Go ahead. I deserve it. I wish those stupid racoons had never brought me to the
  future.
- Really? I can go back in time?
- That is interesting. Why?
- Everybody wins!
- I hope your calculations are correct.
- Whoa, thanks! If you ever need a saviour again, just ask.
- Man, I can't wait to tell everyone what happened.
- Huh. Did everything just taste purple for a second? Oh well. Let's go home you dumb
  poop machine.
- Hey Leela. I guess I got this for you.
- Then I am the most important person in the universe.
- Hooray!
- Woohoo!
- Larger than an American sedan?  How big is the honey comb?
- But Leela we're no good!
- I'm not scared of that at all!
- Like my parents. Oh wait, that was hitting!
- Leela let's turn back. There's absolutely no shame in wussing out.
- Oh my God! The old Planet Express ship!
- Hey what's this goop?
- Bees make honey and jelly? Huh. How come nothing humans make taste good? Help! I
  can't swim in jelly as far as I know!
- Leela! Stop bonding and lets go! I got jelly in my underpants!
- We made it! We're alive!
- Leela we got lucky this time but you should be more careful. I don't want anything
  to happen to you.
- Look out!  You want her you'll have to go through me.
- Leela?
- Nope, I'm better than ever. Before the accident I couldn't do this!
- Then I'll prove I'm alive! By telling you something only I could know. There's a
  surprise for you in my locker. I got it at a Swedish novelty shop before we left.
- Sure. There's just one thing I want you to.
- I want you to wake up.
- Hi Leela! I'm just gonna keep talking, even if you can't hear me. Blah blah blah,
  blah blah blah blah blah.
- Oh yeah?  Could a dream take you dancing in an illusion garden?
- Then what if we shared a sleigh ride across the ice fields of Hiperia?
- Here, take my jacket. You look a little cold.
- You can. All you have to do is wake up.
- Why and I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?
- Neat!
- Me too.
- Uh, not everything.
- You have to wake up.
- Leela! You're awake!
- In the hospital. The ambulance brought you here right after the bee stung you.
- Stinger went right through me and you got all the poison. My new spleen came from
  a guy who liked to motorcycle.
- I though that if you heard a familiar voice, it might help keep your mind together.
  But, who knows if it really got through.
- So, will you go out with me?
- Whatever's in there it's the only thing I've ever wanted.
- Let's just forget about the box. The Professor said to stay away.
- No.
- Tangled up Christmas lights! We can take shifts untangling them!
- Oh wow. It's like that drug trip I saw in that movie when I was on that drug trip.
- We called it first. Besides, this place kinda feels like a "B" y'know?
- You mean you flipped the coin too? And it was tails? So that's why you said you
  had to meet that ghost.
- One year later I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert by a guy named Scrunchy!
- Yo, did two shellfish in scrubs go by?
- There but for the flip of a coin go we. So uh Leela, seeing how the universe wasn't
  destroyed, you wanna catch an ape fight? Y'know? Together?
- So? Heads or tails?
- That's it! I'm getting a hundred cups of coffee! Starting now.  Coffee machine,
  one cup of coffee please.
- Uh, I'll have a coffee.
- Whale please.
- Yeah yeah yeah keep it comin' put the pot down get away!
- Of course I've been up all night! Not because of caffine it was insomnia I couldn't
  stop thinking about coffee I need a nap.  Coffee time!
- Fancy cigar why don't you smoke it already? Puff puff go go go go go!
- Coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee!
- Shh! What was that sound?
- I meant the sound Bigfoot just made. He's been sighted a lot in this area recently.
  Just last week a blind hiker felt him!
- Of course I do! Bigfoot's my hero. Growing up, he was the celebrity I most identified
  with.
- '''Cause he was a loner who hated the popular monsters yet longed to be one.'
- I get it!
- That proves it!
- Sir, if I may, why don't you set up like a billion video cameras in the woods and
  see if he walks by one.
- You doin' alright out there buddy?
- Bigfoot? Bigfoot?
- Bigfoot? Is that you? I'm not like the others Bigfoot. I see through your monster
  coatings to the gentle loner inside. I bet you have a wounded racoon friend that
  you tenderly nurse back to health and go......and in the end they shoot you. But
  you teach us about things. Oh, it's a flying saucer. (shouting) Excuse me? You can't
  park here. The parking area's over there.  Wow nice tube!  Hey. Hey what's the big
  idea? Stop abducting me. Why does your vanity plate say "Probe 1"?
- Amy, you won't believe what happened......it was so scary that you wouldn't -  I
  know but listen it gets even scarier.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you. See -  Why are you all staring at me like that?
  Is there something on my face?
- Tell me what?
- What?
- In the woods, I was walking. For Bigfoot, looking and then aliens beamed me up.
- I'm a pathetic freak. My life is ruined.
- I'll never have another moment of happiness.
- Like me!
- My nose is an aphrodisiac?  I'm gonna drop a barf!
- Blech! We have to track down my nose before some alien snarfs it and does the worm.
  Who's in?
- It's no use. We've been to ever scuzzy bazaar in the galaxy, including Pottery Barn.
- Uh, I'm looking for human horn.
- Nope, uh-uh, eww!  Now look, this is the nose we want. Did you sell it to somebody?
- Oh great space king. I humbly beg you to return my human horn.
- (sadly) Alright. I give up. I guess I'll just go home and marry a skunk.
- My nose! Light of my face!
- Hey! You burned my cheek!
- No I mean the singed flesh, I can smell it!  Those lilacs on the table.
- Well, great seeing you, I guess we'll be on our -
- Hey, what've you heard?
- OK, you can have my nose.
- Wait! I'm usually the first guy to toot my own lower horn -
- But in this case I just don't think it'll do any good.
- However huge it might be.
- Wh-What if we helped you get your passion back without the hassle of mutilating
  me?
- Then it's a deal. We get one night. I keep my horn as long as you two end up doing
  the horizontal monster mash.
- So, what can I get you this evening?
- I'll just start you off with some bread. Some sexy, arousing bread!
- So uh, how are you two sneaky poopums doing?
- Come on freedom cage! Roll me to safety! Yes! I never thought I'd escape with my
  doodle, but I pulled it out!
- Bigfoot! He's real! I knew it. The Loch Ness Monster's book was right!
- Yeah!
- So who should I root for? America or one of those countries I learned about at the
  Food Court?
- But have they seen your...y'know...physique, since the old days?
- I can't watch this 'cause it's creepy and wrong and sick. However I will watch out
  of curiosity.
- But you're not really a lady anyway. Right?
- You gotta tell me. You're not actually attracted to Calculon right? And if you are
  don't tell me. Are you?
- But what if he wants to, I mean if he tries to...uh...Barry White?
- I'll miss you buddy. You've been like a brother and then a sister to me. And now
  you're getting married. I love you.
- Cool. What's for dinner?
- That's marriage alright!
- So now you do wanna marry him?
- Eck!
- Yep.
- Yes. And I have a message for you from Colonel Mitumba! He says this......is from
  Congo Jack.
- Well Bender, I hope this has taught you a lesson about changing your sex to win
  five gold medals.
- Yay my buddy's home! And his respect for women is back to normal.
- Eww!
- C'mon Bender let's go. This chick flick is getting me all barfy.
- Aw man!
- And there's a robot scratching post. You should try it out Bender.
- (shouting) I get it!
- (shouting) Oh, now I get it!
- Oh yeah, no, you're pretty perfect.
- Hey where's Bender?
- Nah, I had it coming.
- This show's been going downhill since season three.
- Look, there's Macaulay Culckon.
- Psst. There's that robot child actor who grew up an robbed a convenience store!
- Pft. What kind of bozos would start a Bender protest group?
- Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.
- Hey Bender.  Hey Bender.  Hey Bender. Hey Bender.
- Hear hear!
- Nothing good.
- (singing) We've got nothing better to do...
- (singing) We don't wanna know!
- Bender?? I was just not playing the holophonor.
- I am trying. (ashamed) I've been taking lessons.
- I know I should but I just can't. Remember when I had those stomach worms that made
  me smart? I could play the holophonor and it made Leela like me.  Hey Bender, as
  long as you know, I have a holophonor recital Tuesday and I'd really like to have
  somebody there. Please?
- Uh...hello Mrs Mellenger.
- The...Grumpy Snail.  Sorry.
- Ow! No! Quit it! Stop it!
- It's hopeless. I can hear all this great music in my head but my stupid hands can't
  keep up.
- Uh...a concert.
- (quietly) Pretty boy.
- It could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch if I could just learn to
  play this stupid thing.
- Yep. I need to get really good without practicing.
- Sure it would.  Oh well. Goodbye.
- He is?  Great! Wait, what's the catch?
- I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to -
- Well...alright. You sure I probably won't know him?
- Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam!
- Stop being such a baby and chop my hands off.
- (impressed) How'd you do that?
- At last! At last I have the power to make Leela love me.
- Check it out everyone. I'm back from hell and I've got the Robot Devil's hands!
- Alrighty!
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah, they get around! But I'm afraid we had a deal.
- Yes you did.
- Show him in.
- Thank you sir, that's exactly what I was going for.
- But, I've never written an opera.
- But I wouldn't even know what to write about. Unless...  OK I'll do it. If I can
  make it about Leela.
- Leela!  You shouldn't be listening. I-I don't want you to hear it 'til it's done.
- So's a peacock but you don't eat it 'til it's cooked. This has to be perfect. I
  want you to hear exactly what I hear when I think about you.
- (shouting) No!
- Look, what do you want?
- Never! (singing)A deal's a deal, Even with a dirty dealer.
- (singing) Destiny has cheated me by forcing me to decide upon,
- No!  Stop! Take my hands! (singing) You evil metal dork!
- My hands. My horrible human hands. And what did you do to my nails?
- But I can't play anymore.
- Ah! Ooo, ah, whoa, hey!
GALAXY:
- I do now.
- Possible. I am user friendly. My good chum.
- I have always been.
GAMMABOT:
- It's funny but is it going to get them off their tractors?
- It will play in Peoria.
GARFUNKEL:
- Here's a song that was beautiful when it was performed by my ancestor, Art.
- (singing) Remember me to one who loves there,
- Bender, to start your foundation for broken robots, here's a big cardboard cheque
  for $14,000.
- Over my dead career!
GARY:
- (from outside) I'll be waiting.
- That dress looks great on you.
- I must say, Amy, you're all made up, just like Fry's date. Get it?
- I'll take one.
- (whispering) You know what I'd like to do...?
- Maybe later.
- Actually, I thought Amy might like to come back to my place for coffee.
- Neither do I.
- Let me pick up the check.
- I'm a banking industry regulator.
- Oh, no, that's not true. You see, modern banking regulations are a product of five
  different regulatory traditions. Six if you wanna get technical.
- It all began in 1410 when a number of noblemen convened...
GEARSHIFT:
- No, Bender, wait. We're the lamest frat on campus. Even Hillel has better parties
  than us. Please, you've gotta stay and teach us how to be cool.
- Fatbot! No!
- (shouting) Hey, Bender, you sure this is a short-cut?
GENERAL:
- Son I think I can safely say (shouting) whoaaaa!
- Eurgh!
- What is your purpose here?
- Get me the president.
- Welcome to Roswell President Truman.
- Mr President, our men have assembled the parts of the alien ship into it's original
  design.
- But sir, that's where we're building the fake moon landing set.
GILLMAN:
- Hell, no. I am Fishy Joe! I've got a fast-food franchise on every planet in the
  known universe. Uh, except McPluto.
- Good point, not interested. But these Popplers, these are great. How much you sell
  'em for?
- You'll never make money that way. You supply 'em to me and I'll sell 'em for two
  bucks a dozen at my restaurants. I'll even pay you a dollar a dozen.
- Absolutely not, Linda. I don't think anyone's here to make that claim.
- Listen...
- '...we''re talking about a snack...'
- '...that''s low in fat...'
- '...and high in profit.'
- There's not even any strong evidence that these Popplers are intelligent.
- Oh, don't force your tired philosophy on us. I mean, the only reason we don't eat
  people is because it tastes lousy.
- Popplers are no smarter than any other animal I've served. And that includes cats.
- Sir, I'm making a point. If these gutter-mouthed creatures are so smart, why don't
  they defend themselves, eh?
- 'Look, I''m willing to grant that it''s murder. The real issue is: Who''s gonna
  stop me?'
GIRL:
- Mommy, why is that man like that?
- (thinking and writing) Please, please don't bring me any gifts. The bicycle you
  fired at me last year from your bicycle gun really tore up my insides.
- Mommy! Mommy! Santa's through the perimeter!
- When I grow up I want to injure men by throwing stuff at them just like you Leela!
  Will you sign my magazine?
- Well, uh...to eBay?
GLAB:
- Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the DOOP's magnificent
  new headquarters. A fitting home for an organisation that has fostered peace throughout
  the universe. Even between the Insectoids and the Space Lizards.
- I can think of no better place for this centre of diplomacy than here in orbit around
  the Neutral Planet.  What are your thoughts on this momentous occasion, Your Neutralness?
- And now, to cut the ribbon, the legendary DOOP captain who just returned from a
  triumphant carpet-bombing of Eden 7, Zapp Brannigan.
- Zapp Brannigan, you stand accused of blowing up DOOP headquarters. How do you plead?
- Then the prosecutor will call his first witness.
- I'm going to allow this.
- The jury is instructed to disregard its own testimony.
- The evidence against Zapp Brannigan is strong. However, in light of his years of
  service, and the incompetence of this hillbilly prosecutor, I'm afraid I must dismiss
  all charges.
- I'm going to allow this.
- I'm going to allow this.
- Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you may begin your deliberations.
- Zapp Brannigan, you are hereby stripped of your rank as captain and dismissed from
  the DOOP.
- Kif Kroker, you are also stripped of your rank and dishonourably discharged.
- Captain Leela, is this rambling story of magic and heroism true?
- In that case, Zapp Brannigan, I hereby restore your rank and parking privileges.
GLERMO:
- (shouting) Hey, I don't pay you to sing! You just used up today's bathroom break!
GLURMO:
- Welcome to the planet Wormulon. I'm Glurmo, your golly-rific guide to the splend-tacular
  Slurm factory.
- You'll have all the Slurm you can drink later on when you're partying with my good
  friend Slurms MacKenzie.
- He'd better be, that's what we pay him for. Right, Slurms?
- In fact, Slurms has to party all night, every night - or he's fired!
- 'But before the party, you''re all in for a fun-derful treat: A VIP tour of the
  Slurm factory!'
- Welcome, my friends, to the wondrous world of whimsy that we like to call "Slurms
  Centralised Industrial Fabrication Unit".
- Why those are the Grunka Lunkas. They work here in the Slurm factory.
- As we sail down the river of Slurm you'll see our mix-ologists at work.  They take
  900 of the finest ingredients, add a touch of child-like delight and mix it all
  with glacial spring water from our glacial spring water generator. Then, last of
  all, we add the secret ingredient that makes Slurm so deliciously addictive.
- It's whatever your imagination wants it to be.
- (sternly) That's not for you to know. (normal) Now, over here the Grunka Lunkas
  are inducing Wumpus berries to release their flavour, using sensual massage.
- No.
- Yes.
- Enough! There will be no further questions.
- I heard that!
- Now on your right, you'll see the Slurm Master checking the Slurm for colour and
  bouquet.
- Then he tastes it. He tastes it and tastes it, then tastes it some more.
- No food or drink allowed on the tour. You'll have to wait until you're partying
  with Slurms MacKenzie.
- Soon enough.
- Nothing.
- That's right. They think they have a good union but they don't. (whispering) They're
  basically slaves.
- Yes, over in-- Say, weren't there more people in your group at the start of the
  tour?
- If you'll excuse me.
- Well, my curious friends, you learned the secret of Slurm. That concludes the portion
  of the tour where you stay alive.
- No, you stole them, we saw you.
GOD:
- Possible. I do feel compasson for all living things. My good chum.
- That seems probable.
- Yes.
- Then I don't know that.
- Yes, but there are so many asking so much. After a while you just sorta tune it
  out.
- Yes I saw. You were doing well until everyone died.
- Right and wrong are just words. What matters is what you do.
- Bender, being God isn't easy, if you do too much, people get dependent. And if you
  do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch, like a safecracker or
  a pickpocket.
- Yes, if you make it look like an electrical thing. When you do things right, people
  won't be sure you've done anything at all.
- Earth? Which way is that?
- Huh?
- No, no. Well so long. Remember what we talked about.
- When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
GOPHERS:
- (singing) We carry a harpoon,
GORE:
- I'm Al Gore. And these are my Vice Presidential Action Rangers; A group of top nerds
  whose sole duty it is to prevent disruptions in the space-time continuum.
- That, and protect the space-time continuum. Read the constitution!
- very much so. But first, meet the Action Rangers. You already know Stephen Hawking.
  Also with us are Nichelle Nichols, a.k.a. Commander Uhura.
- Tell them I'm in the tub! To my left you'll recognise Gary Gygax, inventor of Dungeons
  & Dragons.
- And our summer intern, Deep Blue. The world's foremost chess-playing computer.
- Not all missions can be solved with chess, Deep Blue. Someday you'll understand
  that.
- If we don't go back there and make the event happen, the entire universe will be
  destroyed! And as an environmentalist, I'm against that.
- 'Well it''s obvious what should have happened: That wang to the head should have
  killed you.'
- No! Wait! There must be a peaceful--
- Put the dice away before I take them away.
- Get in the tube, dummy! We only have a few seconds before the universe is destroyed.
- You fool! You foolish fool!
- 'I don''t know. But I can darn well tell you where we''re not: The universe.'
- I'm a 10th-level Vice President!
- I have ridden the mighty Moon Worm.
- My fellow Earthicans, as I discuss in my book, Earth In The Balance and the much
  more popular Harry Potter And The Balance Of Earth we need to defend our planet
  against pollution. As well as dark wizards.
- That's why I'm offering a bag of Moon Saphires to the scientist who can solve this
  problem once and for all.  Lovely aren't they?
- First up is Professor Ogden Wernstrom.
- Alright, What else we got?
- Our next speaker is -
- Yes, it's your turn to speak.
- Yeah, I didn't need to hear that.
- I must go now, to help collect cans on Jupiter. Peace out ya'll!
GORGAK:
- I will be a forceful and effective administrator.
- Your Highness, a package came for you.
- You touched me in ways I've never been touched before.
- And now, get ready to laugh til your sides leak with our planet's foremost political
  satirist, Florp!
- Oh, dear!
GORILLAS:
- (shouting) Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom!
GUARD:
- Exaulted leaders, the Earth messengers have arrived bearing a peace offering from
  their weak and fearful government.
GUARDS:
- (chanting) Hail! Hail! Hail!
GUENTER:
- I'd rather live in a crate than share a room with this dork.
- You're wasting your breath, Professor. He'll never understand a word of it.
- I don't eat bananas. I prefer banana-flavoured energy bars made from tofu.
- I believe the answer is the television.
- (shouting) Hey! You like bananas?
- (shouting; from outside) I got her number. How do you like them bananas?
- Sorry I'm late, I was off at a study session ... with Chrissy!
- (horrified) Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?  This is so humiliating.
- No! Stop!
- Oh, dear Lord, all over the dean!
- (crying) Leave me alone.
- (crying) Of course I do. I try so hard to fit in but seeing my parents act like
  that made me realise I'm just a primative beast.
- (crying) So what? I mean, sure, it looks cool and it makes me smart but it doesn't
  make me happy.
- (crying) They can't. It's all the hat.
- The jungle. But I couldn't do that to the Professor. I'm his prize experiment, and
  he's like a father to me.
- Eureka! The hat goes on the head. It's all so obvious now!
- Oh, my goodness. (shouting) Hang on. I need to do some calculations.  Got it!  Grab
  on!
- Why bother? I've got nothing to live for. I was miserable as a genius, and as a
  monkey, I was so dumb I tried to wear a hat on my butt.  (sadly) There's just no
  place for me in this world. (normal) Although, on the other hand--
- I guess the hat must have broke my fall.
- No, wait! I like it like this. I actually feel sort of happy.
- When I had that there was too much pressure to use it. All I want out of life is
  to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit. That's why I've decided
  to transfer to business school!
GUS:
- A robo. You know? A robot-hobo.
- Get ready. We's gonna jump off at that switching prism up ahead.
- Welcome to Bumbase Alpha, the biggest hobo jungle in the quadrant.
- Helmut Spargle. He used to be the greatest chef.
- Yep. I once ate there back when I what was a senator.
- Ooh yeah!
- Fine lookin' eats!
- Oh I'm not drunk, I'm mentally ill! But I like what what you said!
GUY:
- Wooo!
GWEN:
- For 30 years we've shared the adventure of managing Romanticorp.
- No.
- Knowing which pickup lines fizzle and which ones sizzle keeps us on the cutting
  edge of flirtation technology.
- My family has been making these hearts since the 1900's. Tastes may have changed
  but our secret recipe sure hasn't.
GYGAX:
- Greetings! It's a ...  ... pleasure to meet you!
- A school bus!
- Mr. Fry, the time disruption indicates that some of that was supposed to happen
  but didn't, due to a quantum fluctuation.
- Let's try something else. Maybe we should--
- Here. Take my plus-one mace.
- Anyone wanna play Dungeons & Dragons for the next quadrillion years?
GYPSY:
- My friend, you have nothing to worry about. Except a nightmare-ish life of unremitting
  horror!
- For, you see, you are a were-car.
- The car that ran you down on the moors was also a were-car. It beamed a virus to
  you through its demonic headlights.
- Yes. So crazy that it must be true! Each midnight, when your clock resets to zero,
  your hardware reconfigures into a murderous, four-wheeled car.
- Yes. But you must be willing to pay a terrible price.
- Follow me.
- According to this ancient read-me file, your only hope is to destroy the original
  were-car.
- In its death throes, the dread car will beam out the virus's uninstall program,
  thus ridding you of the curse.
- Who said that? Sure you can die. You want to die?
- Then live on, forever cursed. Each night, your attacks will become more gruesome
  until, one dark night you are doomed to kill your dearest friend.
- Now go! Go!  Uh, could one of you just...? Ah, forget it. I'll just sleep here.
- "Sure I hold s\xE9ance, channel your friend no problem. Insert coin.  I am your\
  \ friend...Bonder."
- Yes. I am fine. Give the gypsy $10.
- Look, you want false hope or not?
- Well, there is perhaps one way. Have you heard of the Monks Of The Shubah?
- They are an ancient order who believe God exists in the depths of space. They have
  built the universe's most powerful radio telescope, high in the Himalayas, to search
  for him.
- What am I psychic? I mean yes! Yes, I'm sure they will. Yes.
HAIRBOT:
- I got your page Mr Fry, your new hair is ready!
- I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl.
HAMMURABI:
- Dy-no-mite!
HATTIE:
- Dr. Mobootu collected this crap while he was exploring the watcha-call-it...universe!
- It's got a TV, you young watcha-call-it...idiot!
- Pardon me. I don't mean to pry into what you're doing in here with the crab and
  the one-eyed lady and the Chinese girl but everyone on this floor is having trouble
  with their TV reception.
- Relax, sonny. This kajigger'll find the source of the interference.
- There's your problem.
- Well, you heard the mob!
- No he can't.
- I like a man who's flexible!
- Go away!
- Oh, alright. But just one glass!  (from inside) OK, that's enough.  I said that's
  enough!
- Let's all go to the lobby!
- Tell me doctor, how's my cyst?
- 'I own one share of Planet kajiggers so I''m entitled to some answers. Question
  1: Why does no one visit me in my home?'
- Enough talk. It's time for action. I move that everyone come to my apartment to
  snuggle my cat.
- I move that we vote on a new Chief Executive Officer and oust this old creep. And
  also that make cat smells good and is pretty.
- I demand the floor. I may only have one share but I get to vote same as anyone.
  And I'm voting against the cat hater.  Isn't that right kitty?  Hey! You ate my
  change!
- How the?
- Millionaires nothing! The stock's only worth three kajiggers!
HAWKING:
- No. Today I'd like something good.
- Sure. Why not?
- There is nothing to be concerned about. I must go. There is much to do.
- Toss it in the garbage!
- (from alley) There he is. Seize him.
- I call it a "Hawking Hole".
- Who is The Journal Of Quantum Physics going to believe?
- I call it a "Hawking Chamber".
- Hold him down.
- Yes. Shove him in the tube. It was my idea.
- Great. The entire universe was destroyed.
- I guess.
HEATHER:
- Hi, I'm Heather your personal Youthasizer! Lets get started with a nice botulism
  treatment shall we?
- Oh!  In small doses botchelism toxin tightens and tones the facial muscles instead
  of killing you in the most horrible fashion imaginable.
- Hmm, you're still retaining a lot of grump in these joints.  More pressure.
- Since this is such a serious case of old, we'll have to try our strongest treatment.
  A soothing full body bath in searing hot tar. Sir, its not neccesary or wise to
  be naked.
- The tar blisters the age right out of the body in what top scientists suspect is
  a miracle.
HEDONISMBOT:
- I apologise for nothing!
- Let the games begin!
- Oh my!
- Ah Fry, congratulations. Your latest performance was as delectable as dipping my
  bottom over and over into a bath of the silkiest oils and creams!
- You were the sole diversion in what has been a pale and unamusing season. And so
  I would feign commission you write an opera.
- And I've never heard one. Still, if you can keep me amused through the overture
  I shall consider it a smashing success.
- A man writing an opera about a woman? Oh sera, how deliciously absurd!  I shall
  see you at the premiere.
- Courtesans and gentle fops. I bid you welcome to my opera.  Let us cavort like the
  Greeks of old. (sexfully) You know the ones I mean.
- But I'm not done vomiting.
- Surgery in an opera? How wonderfully decadent and just as I was beginning to lose
  interest.  The chocolate icing! Oh my!
- Less reality, more fantasy. Resume the opera.
HELPER:
- Hello there chum. I understand you miss your buddy! Have a pudding pop!
- Who wants to go to an amusement park?
- Have a good time. Hey, I hear your friend Bender is back.
- No. I just thought you would enjoy that for a moment.
HERMENTHOTIP:
- Excellent work! I am very proud of all you slaves.
- And now, I have a grand announcement. In honour of your achievement, you're all
  hereby -
- (hoarse) Tell the slaves they can all go.
- (hoarse) No. I mean they are all free.
- (hoarse) No, I -
HERMES:
- Someone come and dropped this package through the slot last night. Now which one
  of you is the captain?
- OK, Captain, this is just a standard legal release protecting Planet Express from
  lawsuits in the event of the unforeseen.
- Mmm.
- Yeah.
- (chuckling) Oh, you don't want that!
- Sign the paper!
- Fry, mon, if you're going to be living in the office you could at least be on time
  for work.
- Alright, people. I will now outline today's 12-point agenda. We'll begin with point
  one then race forward --
- 'Concerning our pest problem: Somebody''s been leaving food around and it''s attracting
  owls. And I, for one, am getting tired of cleaning those owl traps.  Now......as
  this shocking graph indicates, our water consumption has tripled in the last month.
  I notice Fry has been here for a month, so I''m appointing him head of a committee
  to find who''s responsible. Fry?  Am I cracking up, or is Fry''s living here starting
  to get in the way of bus -'
- We'll bill you for the couch.
- Hey, mon!
- These are mighty tasty!
- Oh, come on!
- Alright!
- I don't know, Amy. I just don't know.
- The Federal Sex Bureau.
- That's why Bender will have to make the actual delivery.
- Now, look here, Bender. I respect your diversity to the extent the law requires
  but you used up all your days off when you had that bout with Roberculosis.
- To Fry.
- Bender, man. It has come to my attention that this company has been paying you to
  do nothing but loaf about on the couch.
- I'm sorry but if you want to continue drawing a salary you gotta do more than watch
  the cooking shows all day.
- Why can't they go today?
- Our electric bill's climbing faster than a green snake up a sugarcane. Obviously
  someone round been wastin' a whole heap a juice! Probably you!
- And as a further cost-cutting measure, I have eliminted the salt-water cooler.
- Oh, yes!
- Mon, I'm hungrier than a green snake in a sugar cane field!
- Don't be a dog heart, woman. You know I can't. Not after what happened.
- No, boy, stop! It's too low! Your backbone can't take it!
- (screaming) Nooo!
- (gasping) Faster!
- No one, except a legendary limbo champion.
- Ooh! It's been a while.  This one is for that little kid who's limboing up in heaven
  right now.
- I still got the moves! Zoidberg, lower the door another inch.
- Yes, dear.
- Uh, can somebody help me up?
- Everyone else is off the ship. Where in Babylon is Bender?
- It's fake, mon!
- What in the name of Bob Marley's ghost? Get to work, you lazy boat bag!
- Labor Day? That phoney-baloney holiday crammed down our throats by fat-cat union
  gangsters?
- Hot damn, a day off!
- Ready Freddy!
- Aha!  Found you!
- What in Babylon?
- Faster!
- (sexfully) I'll see you during the recess!
- We find the defendant vulnerable yet spunky!
- Bender, mon, lie yourself down.  You're payin' for that!
- So you're telling me I could fire my whole staff and hire Grunka Lunkas at half
  the cost?
- Aww, he's holding a spoon.
- Now he's wearing a hat!
- That's Leela!
- Or like the Federation from your Star Trek programme.
- The green dude and the fat man.
- I concur.
- Jah damnit! We're stuck.
- Sweet lion of Zion! Look at the Professor go.
- Listen, you filthy crab, a thousand years ago there was a legendary team of Jamaican
  bobsledders.
- A true inspiration for the children. Um, a little help please?  (screaming) Nooo!
- Happy Xmas, Xmas people! Xmas cards have arrived! Xmas!  Amy, there you go, Fry,
  Professor, Zoidberg, a mighty haul for Bender.
- 'And last, but not least, the sweet flower of the office: Me. Hermes Conrad.'
- Fry's over there, man.
- Yeah, right! As if you ever did anything charitable.
- Just be back by sundown, mon.
- I hear that! I aks him to set the table. Instead he goes out to buy you a present.
  Selfish dog.
- Oh, the irony. I sold my hair so I could buy this third set of combs for Zoidberg.
- Sweet manatee of Galilee! He's on the roof!
- Maybe he is a parasite!
- (from inside) And now you're asking for a day off? Get out of my and my sight!  You're
  bogarting my patience.
- Myself. I asked myself a Valentine's Day off. But I was in no mood for any of my
  shenanigans.
- Which concludes the summary of the movie I saw last night. Now, any old business?
  Any new business?  Anyone spend the night together?
- Oh, my God!
- Well I think Amy and Fry go together like a lime and coconut.
- (shouting) Fry! Amy! Put your pants back on; I need a stapler.
- Sweet llamas of the Bahamas! Except for that stylish beard, he looks just like Bender!
- Take a rage dump man. He's no worse than Bender.
- Rage dump!
- (monotonous) Good morning, people.
- (monotonous) The flight had a stopover on the Brain Slug planet. Hermes liked it
  so much he decided to stay of his own free will.
- (monotonous) On to new business. Today's mission is for all of you to go to the
  Brain Slug planet.
- (monotonous) Just walk around not wearing a helmet.
- (monotonous) I got you an official Bender hat.
- Thank God I'm free of that nightmare!
- (monotonous) Thank you. It was cold down there on the floor.
- (monotonous) That's exactly what I was thinking.
- Get ready for fun Fry. Nowadays we have a type of game played entirely on video.
- Oh this is great!
- Finally, the last form of the day. Welcome to stampy-town. Population - five! And
  now for the finishing touch.  Ah, the cycle of bureaucracy.  Sweet gorilla of Manila!
  A letter from the Central Bureaucracy!  (reading) Attention Hermes Conrad, you are
  about to recieve a letter from the Central Bureaucracy.  My God! It's from the Central
  Bureaucracy!
- Better. The Central Bureaucracy is conducting an inspection tomorrow. I'll finally
  be promoted to grade 35, the 35th highest grade there is.
- Sorry. I spent all day putting my office in order. Now I got to go home and relax
  the traditional Jamaican way - a glass of warm milk and good night sleep.
- Great cow of Moscow!
- Oh! I'll never pass inspection now! They'll bust me lower than a limbo stick - at
  carnival time.  (crying) And that's as low as limbo sticks get.
- It's too late. The inspector will be here in exactly one second.
- Who the hell are you?
- Hermes Conrad, bureaucrat grade 36.
- This way please.
- Outta my way wife...!
- '...I wasn''t cut out to be a bureaucrat anyway. I''m only anal 78.36% of the time.
  I''m not worthy to stamp a form. So I''ll stamp the pavement with my flabby body.'
- Life. Death. Either way I'm demoted to a tiny cubicle.
- Sweet something of...of someplace.
- Oh! The ultimate penalty.
- Curse that Dr Zoidberg! If I get out of here, he'll be looking down the business
  end of a shrimp fork!
- Look at that. The carts go out full but they come in empty. It's criminally inefficient.
- But don't you see? They could increase efficiency 4% if they used the empty carts
  to haul in heavy mining machinery.
- You rang?
- No, I want to live. Organising that forced labour spa rekindled my lifelong love
  of bureaucracy.
- Dr Zoidberg brought us.
- Number 1.0, I hereby petition you for an emergency sort-and-file, under regulation
  2 point -
- Sir please, I must located the disk with my friend's brain on it.
- Requisition me a beat.
- Just the bureaucrats, Jamaica!
- Congratulations.
- 'Not so fast! When I was sortin'' I came upon a certain document filed by one Morgan
  Proctor.  Form B: Notification Of Romantic Entanglement.'
- Yes but you only stamped it four times!
- You got it mon! In fact, severely reduced pay all around!  Come on wife, let's blow
  this joint!
- Surprise!
- Up yours Zoidberg. Up wherever your species traditionally crams things. The only
  successful way to choose a successor is with a limbo contest.
- Kingston rules. Two men go down, one come up.
- True mon!
- Oh no!
- Wow!
- Exciting news, people! The pet licence I requsitioned for Nibbler has arrived.
- Dream on, woman. I'd like to put the little bastard in a sack and toss the sack
  in a river and hurl the river into space. But I do like filling out requisitions
  and these were some doozies!  Great Jah's dreadlocks! There's been a mix-up. This
  isn't a pet licence, it's a fishing licence. And it's mandatory!
- Why not?
- Let's see now, which bait to use?  Crickets? Squid? Chicken necks?
- I don't believe this! It's eating my bait!  Beat it, you mooching crawdad!
- My manwich!
- Oh, that's big!
- (from ship) My Speedos!
- The important thing is that we don't panic. There are rules for situations like
  this.  Now, the first order of business is lunch. I suggest a nice lobster Zoidberg,
  I mean lobster Newburg, I mean Doctor Zoidberg.
- Fry, no! The pressure will crush you like a green snake under a sugarcane truck.
- OK, Fry!
- He must've gone out looking for that mermaid. The poor demented honky.
- Well, it's all very nice here but we should be going. I miss me wife and me oxygen.
- That's a very good question.
- That just raises further questions!
- My manwich!
- It's the biggest Jamaican platter I've ever seen. Jerk chicken, jerk beef, jerk
  pork. Is there any meat this man can't jerk?
- What's this under the chocolates?
- Hey.
- We don't have that kind of money. Especially not Zoidberg.
- Oh, Bender's a model employee.
- (cheering) Yes!
- Ah. Time for my precious 10am meeting. Where in Legoland is Leela?
- That's coming outta your pay!
- Planet Express ship, you are cleared to land.
- Oh, man, I'm inhaling these things! You guys scored some primo stuff here.
- According to government records, the only names not yet trademarked are "Popplers"
  and "Zittzers".
- Dooomed!
- Hey, quit hogging the bottle-nose.
- What did you get her, you mushy gizmo?
- Help! The stapler's collating me alive!
- Somebody turn it on!
- Are you mad? Without machines, who will feed us and clothe us and compose our smooth
  jazz?
- We'll go across the street to Pottery Barn and steal their fire.
- Outsiders!
- Impossible!
- Sweet!
- Where in funkytown is the professor?
- We're jerked! Nothing can stop a monster that big.
- Oh, yes!
- Come on, woman! Just pick something.
- Sweet giant anteater of Saint Anita! The Professor's been eaten by giant anteaters!
- If y'ask me, it's mighty suspicious! I'm gonna call the police ... right after I
  flush some things.
- Perhaps the Professor's files can clear things up. (reading) "Citation for public
  nudity", "Conspiracy to commit public nudity". (talking) Aha! A new will! Naming
  ...  ... you as his sole heir.
- It's a video will. It shows you killing him.
- (shouting; from meeting room) What are you hacking off? Is it my torso? It is! My
  precious torso!
- Mail call! Amy, here's your designer lingerie catalogue, Fry, Sadie's Bra Parade
  and Leela, Bulk Underpants Outlet.
- 'And for Bender, uh-oh: A black-bordered envelope.'
- Don't be silly mon, the last ghost died over 200 years ago.
- Of course! It was so obvious!
- Bender mon, no one's trying to run you over. Stop being a big, hallucinating baby.
- I don't want you to worry about your jobs while you're away. That's why I'm firing
  you now.
- We think it's better if you don't know.
- Stop it, mon!
- Sweet ghost of Babylon.
- You're all fired.
- 'Tell me, Zoidberg: Is it carapace or carapass?'
- Organised!
- Dating you ex, Fry? Have you lost all self-respect?
- It's nauseating man!  Is there no way to get rid of the disgusting maggots?
- Definately.
- We gotta get someplace where he won't stick his finger!
- Strange. Usually you don't know anything about human anatomy.
- He'll be as strong and flexible as Gumbo and Hercules combined!
- But what about the worms in the other parts of his body?
- I call it "Carribean Drain-o"!
- 'People, we got a problem: Little Nibbler''s been coughing up hairballs.'
- Now well all love Nibbler, so it's only fair that we all pitch in and clean it up
  together. Still, I propose we make Zoidberg do it. All in favour?
- All opposed?  All abstaining?
- Look, you fat fish. The Planet Express health plan only covers one kind of replacement
  shell.
- "Stick to someone else, you windy barnacle\xAC"
- It's an important unit.
- I'd better make a chart of the suspects. I'll begin by drawing a line with my straight-edge.  Sweet
  lampre of Santa Fe! My edge has been bent!
- Bender!
- 'I know how to settle this: We''ll check last night''s surveillance tapes.'
- Ah. Last night's tape. It was right next to Bathroom Bloopers 4.
- Haile H. Selassie!
- This is mighty strange.  First, the civilisation Space Rome collapsed, then Don
  Martin 3 went caflooie and now Tweenis 12.
- What's got into him? He's twitching like Zoidberg when someone mentions the word
  "food".
- Look at me! I'm invisible!
- Oh, yeah!
- You're a crazy, penniless, lobster doctor. No combination of you should be a comedian.
- You're right, crabby. He's a hell of a lot funnier than you could ever be.
- (shouting) Baby needs a new pair of shoes!
- It all sounds good.
- I'll have a horse coke.
- Neigh.
- First person on Mars? Oh so your brother was that Philip J. Fry!
- Wrong.
- And just in time to screw up this picture I took!
- Tally me banana.
- Daylight come!
- 'I will now read the mandatory speech. (reading) Dear employee: Has it really been
  five, 10 or 15 years? If not, please disregard this and get back to work. Distribute
  token of appreciation and applaud.'
- Yes, yes. Now here's your pension statement. It's empty because you haven't paid
  into it, you dumb stinkbug!
- Poor Fry! He's got the munchies for freedom!
- Oh!
- Times two, carry the one ...
- What are ya--? Sacred hog of Prague! That was my anniversary gift to LaBarbara!
- Robots don't say "ye"!
- That's a plus sign, you pointy-haired loony! Quit thinking you're a robot!
- Hey, mon.
- Fry! Don't be a hero! It's not covered by the health plan!
- Who's brave now?
- It's a triumph of free-spirited German engineering.
- You can do it.
- Kudos, Bender. You got mangled and now you're a singer. Both our dreams came true.
- Go get it, boy!
- Hooray, professor!
- Quiet!
- I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.
- Say, I'm no physicist, but I think I know how to stop the skipping. We'll just -
- I don't know how this was supposed to work.
- Maybe you're just a fantastic lover, Fry.
- Yes!
- My God! He never took middle school hygiene. He never saw the propaganda film.
- Sacred ball of West and Eastern Samoa. We've got to secure for Santa's arrival.
- No. I'm Santa Claus.
- Huddled together in fear like lice in a burning wig.
- Cover your shame mon!
- No!
- There's always next year Professor, there's always next year.
- People! It's Valentines Day next week, so your beloved company has gotten you all
  new uniforms!
- Very good Amy!
- Impressive!
- It looks like toxic waste.  And it smells like toxic waste.
- Delicious fig pudding! Ooh, that's good! But a distinct aftertaste of toxic waste.
- I'm afraid I do.  I order you dispose of that toxic waste properly, or bribe me.
  Either way it'll cost $500.
- Mon, it must take forever to brand all those cattle.
- Please don't do that.
- This sounds like a job for--
- Alright then.
- Holy spitz! He's sportin' skintight speedos!
- Actually on a robot they sorta do.
- If you ever needed a small package brought inot the country without a lot of X-raying
  and such, Bender always had a free body cavity.
- His name is Helper and he's eager to be your new best friend.
- Move forward. Walk into the light.
- It's been a terrible year people. The company is on the verge of bankruptcy.
- Was a substantial loss for the company. The blue slice represent s the money we
  earned from shipping packages while the green slice represents an $8 bank error
  in our favour.
- Worthless.
- And finally, the post office meter is for business mail only.
- Very well. I nominate the Professor.
- Yeah the Professor!
- Well, if I know anything about which number is bigger than the other number, I'd
  say that -
- Then we have a tie. And in the event of a tie the Professor, as the current CEO
  remains -
- Then it's settled. The new chief executive officer of Planet Express corporation
  is That Guy.
- Please welcome our new chief executive officer, That Guy.
- We're ruined!
- We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big, and evil. Ours is small and neutral.
- That Guy is nothing but a flashy con man! And you've been hypnotised by his swinging
  blogney!
- How?
- Great Bonda of Uganda! We can vote against it!
- The shares were worthless and he kept asking for toilet paper.
- You didn't even refrigerate it you spineless lobster!
- My Jah! It's worth less now than when it was worthless!
- Like a sexy Yogi Berra!
- That's statistically impossible. In 77 innings you haven't gotten a single out.
  At this rate, you're sure to go down as the worst blernsball player of all time.
- Ooo!
- This is terrible!
- No!
- You went all the way to Holland already?
- What could you possibly have in common with this walking soup mix?
- Interesting. Maybe we should test this erectile disfunction of yours Bender.
- Strange. You haven't acted suspicious since I found those "ape bones" in the basement.
- Cursed bacteria of Liberia. My own son suspended from boarding school.
- I'm afraid it's both.
- Dwight, you remember the crew?
- No!
- No!
- Now look at all the work I gotta do! Ow!
- Child man, is this true?
- You jerked the words right outta my mouth. We're their fathers and its high time
  we acted like it.
- Get a job you lazy kids!
- Company?  (mocking) How cute! What will you be pedalling? Lemonade? Shoe shines?
  Cootie insurance?
- Welcome to the world of business!
- So your delivery company is just a cute harmless paper route?
- (mocking) Civilisation as we know it might get splashed!
- Off on your first delivery eh? You be careful my little tinkler.  Remember we used
  to call you that huh? Tinkler?
- (shouting) See you at din-din!
- Business is down. So I filed papers to have you all reclassified as slaves.
- What's the trouble men? Need some penny rolls for your profits?
- Uh, in a small way yes. But you still don't have your own building, your own conference
  table or...or one of those things!
- People, as you know our young sons have become great successes in the very same
  field as us.
- Naturally, we're humiliated.
- We'll start by slashing salaries. And this time I mean really slash.
- I don't even know who this guy is!
- Sweet guineapig of Winnipeg! They've taken over our company!
- (angry) You rotten kids! (nicely) Will you be hiring?
- (angry) You rotten kids!
- Might I have one too wife?
- Oh it's true. But they grow up so fast. We just wanted a few more years of being
  better than them.
- Proud of you? You ruined us with sleazy business practices and a complete disregard
  for human decency. But, of course we're proud of you.
- OK boys, let me show you how a paper man does it.
- Aw what kind of father would I be if I said no?
- Alright, alright. What do we do when we break somebody's window?
- Heavens no! We apologise! With nice cheap words!
- Don't worry boys. I'm sure his father is a perfectly normal reasonable man.
- Bring it on Jello-pop!
- Aww, you're good kids.  If I could feel anything right now, it would be pride. I
  was wrong! I can still feel pain!
- Oh why not! Might as well live it up as long as I 've got this catheter in me!
- This is what makes life worth clinging to. Three fathers, enjoying a day out with
  their sons.
- Happy Freedom Day! Ooh! I think my wrist is broken.
- Mmm! That'll feel nice on my shattered bones!
- It costs a little more but it's worth it!
- She means you, you turkey of the sea!
- You could use it for picnics.
- Ooo, while you're there, could you pick me up a licence to kill?
- Uh, what does piano wire count as?
- We've decided to do the merciful thing and have you Youthasized.
- It wasn't me Mr F, it was Amy!  Stop it Amy!
- You know you did it!
- Goodbye Mr Dumbsworth!
- Are you back to your original age Professor?
- And that's if you're not allergic! You don't wanna know what happens then, oh no
  no, God no!
- I didn't want to know1
- Honey comb's big. Yeah yeah yeah.
- No no no.
- It's an old Jamaican accounting tradition. We burn his timecard. That way his zombie
  doesn't come back looking for his final paycheque.
- Soothe us with sweet lies.
- Easy! He told you about it before he died! And your grief roasted mind blocked it
  out.
- I'm from Jamaica, the show-me island. So show me you're blowing it out your fanny.
- You're under a lot of guilt stress Leela. Here, work it off.
- Oh take it easy Leela.
- Sweet three toed sloth of ice planet Hoth! She's awake!
- Ow! You hurt my collater!
- Scram you lousy green snakes!  Here Leela, take this and use it to shoot those guys.
- Whatever.
- Like granny said "If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself!"
  God rest her zombie bones.
- OK.
- Sweet honey bee of infinity!
- Came and went! You're now the proud owner of Bamboo Boogie Boots!  With a warning
  label this big you know they gotta be fun!
- Babylon's bells! I tallyed almost 300 bananas on this entertainment product. Now
  you put 'em on and have fun!
- Well then I'm gonna put 'em on and make you watch me have fun!  See? Fun! Fun! Dwight!
  Help me!
- Isn't this fun?
- Here Dwight, $299 and 99 cents. You invest this penny like you want it.
- A risk taker? That's my boy!
- Goodnight.
- Well, see you in an hour. I gotta go do some business behind that tree.
- Uh...no.
- Man, you are such a jokester!
- Go on stick, touch me! Can't do it!
- Jamaicans have other interests. Which is why the limbo team got detained at the
  airport.
- And I said I'd try my very best.
- I described it to them on the phone, using a series of artful euphanisms.
- Ooo, that's snug!  Oh, those haven't descended in years.
- Barbados Slim! What are you doing here? Last time I heard you were in Barbados.
- Your body may be as perfectly scultpted as it was 20 years ago when you whupped
  my fat ass every time we met......but today, I feel lucky.
- That's it Barbados Slim, you've gone one talk over the line!
- Good Lord man what kind of temporary woman are you?
- Check!
- Here, go up on the roof and install this fake satellite dish so we can impress the
  neighbours.
- Oh, and have Robot 1-X help you.
- Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also (shouting) we're dying!
- Aww well isn't that - ew!
- That's true. If only there were a way to have one party for both of you here at
  the office then write it off as a business expense. Wait! I thought of a way! The
  way I just said!
- Fire 'em all.
- Ras H. Tafari. What's goin' on here?
- That's not a cigar. Uh...and it's not mine!
- Bender eh? That guy's really startin' to twist my dreads.
- Fathers Against Rude Television don't want our kids watching Bender's high definition
  filth.
- No sir, not us FARTers.
- Where did you requisition this party? And Zoidberg, what are you doing here?
- Yeah. Why do these popular kids consider you cool all of a sudden?
- Everybody out!
- There's enough cool stuff here to furnish a happenin' pad. Where did it all come
  from?
- And all from watching you on TV you cool jerk.
- You'd better believe it!
- What makes you think that'll work?
- (ashamed) We're just so busy.
- Well, I'd say we all learned a valuable lesson about TV there.
- (singing) ...To our favourite shows!
- I'll just have a Shirley Hemple.
- (singing) Is this really happening or just being staged?
HICK:
- So. Any you fellas got a special lady back home?
- Holy shoot! Looky!
- Cover us, buddy. You've got the only wounded-up positron shooter.  Fry, you emu-bellied
  coward!
- Whoa, doc, I ain't dead.
- Bender, old buddy. Hang in there.
HIROKI:
- Please welcome the superintendant of Kitchen Coliseum...Chairman Koji!  No robot
  chef has ever competed here but today one has barged his way in to challege for
  the title of...
- 'Let''s meet today''s celebrity judges: Captain of the Harlem Globetrotters, Ethan
  Bubblegum Tate!'
- TV anchor-monster Morbo!
- And a woman who ended a thousand year war with her apple dandies, Martha Stewart's
  head!
- And now, chairman Koji will present the theme ingredient to be used in every dish
  today.
- Soylent Green, a classic ingredient of gourment cooking. And the battle is on.  Aki,
  what's Elzar making?
- Look at Bender roll that dough!
- The iron cook is bringing in his signature creation, a working pastry replica of
  downtown Venice.]
- The iron cook Neptunian has gone all out to please the judges. He's even garnished
  the salad with $100 bills. Let's see what they think.
- Next, up, challenger Bender. A student of the legendary Hemut Spargle, Bender is
  some sort of wonderful mechanical man.
- And now, judgement. The winner will become the new iron cook, the loser is doomed
  to scrub.  Who's confection achieves perfection? Who's foodstuff will be the good
  stuff?
HOBO:
- Gus old chum, let's give a friendly welcome to this new robo.
- No offence intended my filthy friend. In fact, why not join us and ride the space
  rails?
- We're going nearly the speed of light so uh, roll when you land.
- His restaurant was so high toned, the only way to get reservations was to create
  a parallel universe where you already had reservations.
HOOKERBOT:
- Hey, sailing unit!
- Live a little.
- Bender, honey, we love you!
HUMAN:
- I will eat and digest you all with my system of mighty organs. Behold!
IGNER:
- What's wrong, Mommy?
- Can I wear your fat suit?
- Aww.
- Hey, you don't get to laugh.
- Thanks a billion!
- Ow!
- Mommy? Why do the robots give you presents?
- Ow!
- Mommy, why are you making civilisation collapse?
- Huh?
- But if the glasses man makes up with Mommy, she'll be happy and stop the scary robots.
- The man is going to touch Mommy?
- Ow!
- But Mom, you promised you'd make monkey cake today.
- But they're kings mommy!
- Um...uh... Uh, the ballot was confusing.
- OK.  Ow!
- Ow! Oh!
IHAWK:
- Gee, Zoidberg. Leave some for the enemy to kill.
- Yeah, he's a doctor and a butcher!
- When will the killing end?
- Believe it all you want, that won't make it true.  (mauldlin) This isn't a war,
  it's a murder.  (irreverent) This isn't a war, it's a moider!
- I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery.
INUITBOT:
- Yes, it's true. I ran over that bird-watching jerk and a hundred others. Even my
  best friend from aromatherapy school.
- Alas, I'm afraid I'm not the original were-car. I received the curse while taking
  a learning annex class from a famous robot actor.
- (voice-over) You know him as Calculon.
IPGEE:
- This is unacceptable, Leela. You must find this Mr. Fry and install his chip.
- Well that's your job, whether you like it or not and it's my job to make you do
  your job whether I like it or not - which I do - very much! Now get to work!  Life
  is good!
- Hello Leela, you're fired.
- I'm sorry but it's just that you're over a year late for work at this point.
- So I told Leela, "Your request for a date is most flattering but I must decline."
  These office romances never work out. Afterall, that is how I met my horrible wife.
- And my wife doesn't know I have a job. I keep my personal and professional lives
  serparate.
- Oh I am broke. What will I tell my horrible wife?
- Let me see those glasses.
- Oh my various gods! X-Ray specs!
- Get him!
- Oh, I was hoping you would come back! I even saved your poster of a chimp expressing
  your distaste for Mondays.
- Just put your hand under the scanner so I can verify your career chip.  Calcutta,
  we have a problem.
- Oh, here's a cryogenic counsellor! Do you like Mondays?
- Then we'll have to redecorate your office. How do you feel about it helping to be
  crazy to work here but not being necessary?
- Welcome aboard, sir.
IZAC:
- You got it!
- It's obvious, Mr. B, you're in love.
- Hey, you gonna pay for those?
- Security to bar area. Security to bar area.
- Rough him up!
- This penniless chump was stealing drinks, ma'am.
- You got it!
JACKIE:
- Pft, God forbid! Your little freakshow is making it impossible for real female ball
  players to be taken seriously. I hope you're proud of yourself.
- Leela?
- No, don't be. It turns out you were an inspiration afterall.
- Uh-huh. You were so awful that women everywhere set out to prove that they don't
  stink as bad as you. You know, like a pig or something.
- You absolutely did Leela. Now please, please retire! Immediately!
JACKSON:
- Now I respect my opponent. I think he's a good man but, quite frankly, I agree with
  everything he just said!
- And I say your three cent titanium tax doesn't go too far enough!
- I wouldn't think of it.
JANITOR:
- My, my, my! What's a beautiful lady like you --  Oh, my! Eurgh! I'm sorry, I thought
  you had two eyes.
JANITORBOT:
- I'm the janitor, I'm trying to take a nap here.
- I am made of wax, what's it to you?
- Is there some reason a robot made of wax can't take a nap standing up in the middle
  of a bunch of wax robots? Or does that confuse you?
JEFFERY:
- Remember, Rover gets the pill and Pepper gets the suppository.  Next.
- It's just a simple broken fang, nothing serious.
- No-- what? Huh?
- OK, well I believe I have a replacement fang for your pet in the next room. The
  jaguar didn't wanna cooperate but luckily he knocked one of my teeth out. Now then.
- Um, I'm still a little woozy from a gazelle kick this morning but if he's anything
  like the common tree, the rings might indicate his age.
- He's five.
- Don't listen to him. He's the father of all lies and the uncle of all tricks!
JERVIS:
- That'd be me. If you're an investor you can dump your money in the hole there.
- Listening.
- You can't shut us down. The internet is about the free exchange and sale of other
  people's ideas. We've done nothing wrong!
- No stay out! There's a guy going for the Tetris world record in there!
- Oh we're doomed. They got the head, they uncovered the sign! Soon the whole world
  will learn we're cyber criminals! And we would have gotten away with it if it weren't
  for those meddling adults.
JINGLE:
- (singing) Nobody doesn't like Molten Boron!
JOCKEY:
- Hey baby, ever do it in a suitcase?
- Hey what are you doing?
JOE:
- Sorry I'm late. My pool game ran long at the jazz club!
- My name's Joe and I'm a defrostee.
- When I was frozen giant carrots ruled the Earth. But now they don't. It takes some
  getting used to.
JOEY:
- Whoa whoa, calm down Clamps.  The boss, he likes a wall up which his back can be
  put against. Such as like this there.
- Ho ho, this guy's an ox! He's got oxon-like strength! Hey, he needs a nickname right?
  Let's call him Clamps.
- Good thinking! Hey hey! Now, this score ain't gonna be no cake walk in the tea park
  alright, there may be some death killing.
- Hey hey! Way to go way to be way to shoot!
- Yo there's our pigeon now. Let's shoot bullets out of our guns.
- Oh, we'll kill 'em alright.
- They're coming straight towards our proximity. Maybe you should give 'em the clamps
  Clamps.
- Hey boss, looks like somebody beat us to it.
- Hey boss, this here crew list lists a robot on this crew here.
- Yo! The Mafia supports you. But don't tell no one. Spread the word.
- Yeah, but what if management remains intragnizent?
- Yo. Get an eyeload of that filty scab with the beard flashing his filthy scab money.
  It's an insult to you, boss.
- He's flashin' his cash loaf again.
- With all due respect, Donbot, I don't think we should rely on an accident happening.
  Let's kill him ourselves.
JOHNSON:
- 'It''s time someone had the courage to stand up and say: "I''m against those things
  that everybody hates".'
- I say your three cent titanium tax goes too far.
- Unthinkable.
JRRR:
- But elder one -
- Hear me out. There are many good reasons to eat. Hunger, boredom, wanting to be
  the world's fattest man. But not revenge. Are we no better than they? Besides, Leela's
  my friend.
- No.
- When my species grows up, we eat our moms!
JUDGE:
- Thank you, prosecutor. I will now consider the evidence.
- I find the defendants - guilty!
- The humans are hereby sentenced to live as robots live on Earth. They will perform
  tedious calculations and spot-weld automobiles, until they become obsolete and are
  given away to an inner-city middle school.
- Counselor, I remind you that it's unethical to sleep with your client. If you really
  care about the outcome of the case, you should sleep with me.
- Overruled, counselor!
- $500 and time served.
KEGG:
- Don't stop!
KEN:
- Welcome back, Lord Nibbler, Ambassador to Earth, homeworld of the pizza bagel.
- No, we are not.  We Nibblonians are an ancient and powerful race. Behold. When the
  universe was forged in the crucible of the big bang, our mighty race was already
  17 years old.
- 'For the first millisecond of time, things were OK. But then there arose a terrible
  enemy: The Brain Spawn.  Ever since, we have waged unceasing war against these dreadful
  --'
- Then let the feast of a thousand hams begin.
- Thus, they travel from world to world making everyone stupid in order to wipe out
  all thought in the universe.
- Nibblonian fleet holding at perimeter of moron zone, formerly known as "Earth".
- The Brain Spawn are commanded by a giant evil brain with a gooey centre of pure
  hate.
- We've also prepared a bag lunch and some mittens.
- At last, our centuries upon centuries of waiting have achieved fruition.
- Stop that! Uh...please. Your mightiness -
- Does he not know?
- Enough! Fry, it is my duty to inform you that the fate of humanity, the fate of
  our race, indeed the fate of all that exists and all that will exist rests with
  you. You are the single most important person in the universe.
- The time has come to discuss matters of the gravest importance.
- On the contrary. You remember beause you were the only one immune to the brain's
  mental attack.
- Oh my. Anyway, your immunity is due to the fact that you lack the delta brainwave.  It's
  a genetic abnormality which resulted when you went back in time and performed certain
  actions which made you your own grandfather.
- Yes. Except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.
- For a thousand years, the evil brains have been constructing the giant Infosphere,
  a giant memory bank twice the size of three ordinary memory banks.
- 'Once their task is complete, they will ensure no new information arises in the
  only way possible: by destroying the universe.'
KID:
- You stink, loser!
- Yes.
- Stupid senior citizens. Why should we have to pay for their social security benefits?
- You stink loser!
- Hey Captain Yesterday, can I like, wail on you with this 2x4 and it doesn't hurt
  you?
- (crying) It's too grumpy!
KIDS:
- (chanting) One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!
- (chanting) One-eye! One-eye!
- (chanting) One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!
- (cheering) Yay!
- (chanting) Hello, jerkbags!
- (cheering) Yay!
- (chanting) Story! Story! Story!
- (chanting) Ear-face! Ear-face! Sally won the ugly race!
- (chanting) Leela! Leela! Leela!
KIF:
- I suppose, captain. I'm as big a fan of velour as you are. Now what do you want
  to do about that unidentified ship?
- Who are you talking to, sir?
- Shall I fire on them now, sir?
- Sir, they're headed straight for us.
- Sir, they've docked with us and have come aboard.
- Well, if there's anything --
- Oh, jeez!
- I fail to see any problem sir. You already imprisoned her under directive B10.81.
- Right, that law.
- Brannigan's Law.
- Yes.
- The boy, sir?
- The jackass wants to see you in his quarters.
- And he wants you to wear this.
- Yes --  Yes, captain?
- The fatso says you're free to go.
- (quietly) "Why" indeed.
- That's a shame, sir.
- April 13th.
- I'll get the powder, sir.
- Sir, this is a leisure cruise. Our path was set by the travel agency.
- But that course leads directly through a swarm of comets.
- Shouldn't you be steering between the comets?
- Captain, may I have a word with you?
- It's an emergency, sir.
- Sir, remember your course correction?
- Well it's proving somewhat more suicidal than we'd initially hoped.
- Why, that's surprisingly noble of you, sir.
- (sexfully) Hello!
- Um, uh, not me, sir.
- It appears to be the mothership.
- The Hubble Telescope.
- Why?
- Um, sir, you're supposed to be cutting the ribbon right now.
- Sir, I don't think that's wise.
- What?
- No, it doesn't.
- I've computed out landing co-ordinates, Captain.
- Wait, what?
- This is the happiest day of my life.
- The point is, it's just so humiliating working for that man. Once, he actually ordered
  me to ... shave his armpits while he was in the bathtub. So, I said--
- Oh, alright. Um ... well ... how 'bout then, um...OK, well, there he was in the
  tub, alright?
- But now, Zapp's not captain anymore. I'm free!  Oh, you hear that? I'm actually
  laughing!
- What shall I do with your civilian clothes, sir?
- Um, may I have a beer, sir?
- Oh, jeez.
- But, sir, that plan makes no sense.
- To be honest, sir, I'd rather stay here with Captain Leela. She actually listens
  to what I have to--
- I-I'll call and tell you about it.
- 198 billion, sir.
- Sir? (whispering) There aren't that many human beings.
- Please, I'm creating.  Voila!
- Sex-lexia.
- That new recruit is phenomenal, sir.
- What shall I do with your Jergens, sir?
- Ew.
- Being your assistant.
- (uncharacteristically nasty) You speak when I tell you to, you filthy worm!
- Actually, sir --
- Use a brush, you dunderhead! And mix these mixed nuts. I see two almonds touching!
- I love you.  Why must I be such a coward?
- Well, I'm in love with this girl--
- I met her a year ago...
- (voice-over) ...when we were escaping from that cruise ship you piloted directly
  into a black hole.
- I've finished talking, sir.
- Um, sir? I don't go out on many dates and, um, what if I can't think of anything
  to say?
- Maybe I'll just give her these flowers.
- Oh, and I'd like--
- Well, um, um ... hello.
- Amy, (reading) if I said you had a beautiful body would you take your pants off
  and dance around a little?
- (reading) I find the most erotic part of the woman is the boobies
- Oh, my!
- Is there nothing we can do, sir?
- (determined) My years in the DOOP Boys' Chorus will not have been in vain!
- (singing) Once upon a time I was falling in love,
- (singing) ...There's nothing I can do,
- Please, sir. Let's just divide up the check and--
- So, Amy, um, well--
- It is not uncharted, you lost the chart!
- 'Amy. Before I die, I have to tell you: I didn''t mean to say those awful things
  on our date. They were all Zapp''s idea.'
- Yes. And-And that person calling and hanging up, was me. I was just too nervous
  to say hello because I love you.
- My hero!
- So, um, Amy, w-what do you wanna do now?
- Actually, sir, I'm, I'm a little nervous about meeting her family.
- I just hope they like me.
- Amy, no! Not on your parents' planet!
- Oh, I don't--
- Oh. Is it lit now?
- You don't understand. When I get nervous, I can't control my camouflage reflex.
  Oh, dear!  Oh, goodness! Oh, odds and bodkins!
- Actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders
  that--
- I can be manly too. I think I'll, uh, light up a smoke.
- (wheezy) Smooth!
- Oh, now they'll never think I'm manly enough to date their daughter.
- Lieutenant Kif Kroker!
- Mrs. Wong, do you have a neckerchief I could borrow?
- My plan is to take all the remaining buggalo and lead them on a rough, tough cattle
  drive. Then, when the rustlers attack, I'll make a citizen's arrest!
- Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Wong. I'll get your cattle back or die trying.
- Now, we need buggalo to lure the rustlers. How many are left?
- Saddle up, men. We got some no good rustlers to ... catch!
- We'll camp near the top. The rustlers will be sure to spot us there.
- OK, I've got one. This family--
- Amy? What are you doing here?
- What?
- I love it out here, Amy. I feel so manly. I have a blister, I-I spit! A-And of course,
  I tell no one my feelings.
- Oh, yes. But I keep them inside until I can write them in my diary.
- It sure is. I could just lie here beside you staring at the sky all night.
- Maybe we just made love.
- The rustlers must have seen me coming and run off, scared.
- (nervous) Sh! They'll hear us!
- OK, the dynamite's in place.
- I once took a seminar in ejecting chickens from a sand dune. The principle is essentially
  the same.
- But your, um, Martian-ness, these buggalo aren't yours. They belong to the Wong
  family.
- Amy! Nooo!
- Yes ... but ... I'm afraid I've got some bad news as well.
- Um ... well, um ... that is, um...
- I'll get your daughter back, sir. I swear.
- You mean--? Oh, no, please. I beg you! Oh, for the love of--
- She won't leave me alone.
- Amy, no! It's too windy!  Stay calm, dearest! I'll save you!
- Need a lift?
- Smoke-em?
- Ooh, no thanks. I'm on the peace patch.
- Well it's just really that I don't feel that--
- Hey, I'm smoking! I'm the greatest! Oh, monkey trumpets!
- Well, actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders
  that--
- Oh, you're kind. But your parents still don't like me.
- Dear diary, I just made love for the second time!
- One beep for "yes", two beeps for "no".
- Bender the robot, please take the stand.
- (unenthusiastic) Aye, aye, sir.
- Um, sir? There's something about that ensign that's--
- Sir, all planetary defences have been disabled. Perhaps the Decapodians acquired
  our secret codes, somehow.
- Yes sir captain!
- Imagine you stowing away and stealing a licenced starship! Oh it's so romantic it
  gives me the shivvers!
- Oh Amy, I can't stand having a whole universe between us. I've been thinking a lot
  about this and, well, would you move in with me?
- No no, it's really twice the size! You can use the floor and, I'll have the ceiling!
  See?
- Hush! Before you answer, come thither!
- This is the Holo-Shed. It can simulate anything you desire, and nothing can hurt
  you. Except when it malfunctions and the holograms become real.
- 'I wanted to show you what life would be like if we were together. Computer: Run
  program Kif-1.'
- Yes. I prgorammed it in for you! 4 million lines of BASIC! And, if this isn't the
  life you want, how 'bout this? Run program Kif-2!
- We could live here by the shore of the tranquilibrious sea, in a timeshare. And
  I would pluck the moon from the sky, just to see you smile.  Almost got it.  It
  seems to be sort of, stuck! I love you!  Run program Kif://3.
- Amy, we could live in a bus station bathroom for all I care. As long as we're together
  it will feel like a castle to me.
- Oh dear. I feel the Holo-Shed might be broken again. Well, as long as we don't cross
  paths with Atilla the -
- And there's Professor Moriarty, Jack The Ripper, Evil Lincoln!
- The Holo-Shed's on the fritz again, the characters turned real!
- I totally want to!
- Hold me!
- Oh joy!
- Amy, isn't it wonderful? I'm pregnant!
- Well it's quite simple really. When one of my species experiences deep feelings
  of love we enter a so called "receptive state."
- At that point, our skin becomes a semi-permeable membrane which allows the passage
  of genetic material. I held Amy's hand and voila.
- Oh Amy! You'll be a mother!
- What a wonderous affirmation of our love! And all from the touch of your hand.
- Well I suppose I might have gotten pregnant that way. Or even from a toilet seat.
  Though that's impossible since I have a private washroom.
- Oh thank you merciful God!
- Amy? But that means...
- 'Leela must have impregnated me when she grabbed my ungloved hand. That explains
  the poster in hygiene class: No Glove, No Love.'
- Please captain. I thank Leela for the DNA she gave me but in my species, the true
  parent is the one that inspired the initial feeling of love. We call that person
  the smizmar. And my smizmar is Amy.
- You're very open-minded Mrs Wong.
- Lets start with this one. From Bender.
- And this one's from Leela, oh I just love the bow! I wonder what it is!
- It's a basket! F-for picnics?
- Oh this is the happiest moment of my life! You all brought such wonderful gifts!
  But the greatest gift...
- '...is the bond I share with my smizmar Amy. And soon, the quivvering mass of life
  within me will depend on us both. Even now I can sense it feeding, squirming, searching,
  questing and shortly, it will wren my loins into way and pull us down, down, down
  into the deep dark waters of commitment.'
- Oh how could Amy leave me? When will women learn to take responsibilty for the children
  they've helped create? The quickening! My time is near. I must return to my homeworld
  to perform the ancient birthing rites.
- I must now embark on a perilous journey. To give birth in precisely the same swamp
  I was born.
- No Leela. Tradition demands that I make this journey with my smizmar, and since
  Amy isn't here I must go it alone. Farewell. For we may never meet again.
- My scrapes feel a little better now.
- It's a poisonous froad! No one move.
- Behold. The sacred ancestral birthing grounds of my family.
- I am Kif of the clan Kroker. I come to bear my young.
- She's not with me.
- As long as Amy is with me in my heart I will have the strength of two.  Apparently
  Amy hasn't been working out much lately.
- I'll try to endure.
- Amy.
- Amy! Is it you or have I gone crazy with lonliness?
- Oh no time! It has begun!  Oh my!
- Oh nearly!
- Amy my love, tell me, are they making it to the water?
- Oh thank you!
- Well we've given them a great start Amy. And in 20 years they'll sprout legs and
  crawl back onto land as children.
- It shows the time wherever we both are. And it's powered by love! Also you have
  to wind it.
- Oh! Keep peddling! Oh for the love of God keep peddling!
- Wait, that chunk, its the watch!  I got it Amy! I got it! The plan went off without
  a -
- Fine, have the watch. It's broken anyway.
- Precious ambergris?
- Or better yet I'll simply shed my skin!
- So you see the putrid waxy substance I was coated with was -
- Yes! And I managed to sneak some out in a usual place! Ta-da!  Using that, I'll
  make you a perfume of lilac and jasmine and frankenberry!
- Everyone! To the fire door!
KIRK:
- Nice depth-perception, one-eye!
- My eyes may not work, but at least I got two of them!
- Well, if it isn't old one-eye!
KISSENGER:
- How are you?
- Now, as for economic cooperation --
- Say what?
- Mr. Ambassador, our people tell the same story. Oy.
- This isn't a productive area of discussion.
- Please, gentlemen. We must put an end to the bloodshed. We have all seen too many
  body bags and ball sacks.
- Young man, you have the bravery of a hero and breath as fresh as a summer ham.  What?
  What is funny?
KOENIG:
- When we woke up, we had these bodies.
- Ven ve voke up ve had these wodies.
- No!
- Good question!
- How can you do a spoken-word version of a rap song?
- (reading) Keptin, I wope he will welp our ... vessel.
- Keep them and let us go?
- I don't have much experience at fighting-- Except with you guys.
- My face!
- Not just an actor, but a well-rounded person, with my own friends and credit cards
  and keys.
- 24-hour Laundromat.
KOJI:
- '...Iron Cookuru!'
- Soylent Greuu!
- Time, uperuu!
- Challengeruu Benderuu!
- Domo arigato, Mr Roboto.
- Oh! That sword cost 5000 dolluu!
KUG:
- Me hear people. But me not see people.
- Move! Go!
- We no can dunk, but good fundamentals.
- Comedy come from character, real situations. Not abstract craziness.
- Yes. It appear mysteriously just about time men die out.
- Not beltway insider.
- Men strange. You have them on your planet?
- What they for?  Oh, you mean "snu-snu".
- Crushed pelvises.
- He big jerk like man.
KWANZAABOT:
- Yo, Kringle! What happened to you, doll?
- At least they understand you, you know what I'm sayin'? Ain't nobody down with this
  Kwanza tip.
- No time! I gotta hand out the traditional Kwanzaa book.  I've been givin' these
  out for 647 years!
- Ah, you didn't hear about it? Chanukah Zombie's having a luau at the B'nai Brith!
  You comin'?
LABARBARA:
- Come on, Hermes, you could out-limbo all of these people!
- There, there. Now you don't have to limbo if you don't want. It doesn't make you
  any less of a man.
- Oh, Hermes!
- That's my man, alright, baby, limbo!
- Just go on through and hit the release, you hot dog!
- That's my man!
- Spa 5? Is it good?
- My Hermes got that hellhole running so efficiently that all the physical labour
  is now done by a single Australian man.
- It's better than nothing!
- Now hold on, everyone cool your daiquiris! Let's give the little vermin a chance
  to explain themselves.
- Don't you sweet talk me you wrinkly old tube sack!
- Ah you're both pathetic, being jealous of your own offspring. Now you should be
  happy they became successes, instead of following in your footstamps.
- We're here to take my little stub of a husband home. Hermes, say goodbye to Mr Farnsworth.
- Husband, can't you go anywhere without lighting something up?
- Husband, you haven't been an Olympic class limboer for 20 years! Quit lying to your
  podgy self.
- That's when they begged my husband to step in and make an ass out of himself.
- You're that fine Jamaican bacon!
- (shouting) C'mon Hermes, beat that mahogany god!
- Aww, there there Hermes.  You did your best! If I'd wanted a human Adonis for a
  husband, I'd have stayed married to Barbados Slim.
LACKEY:
- You have Mrs Darlinghaven's cotillion at 7 ma'am.
- Madam is outraged.
LAMP:
- I'm not a robot.
LARRY:
- But Mom said --
- Wow, it's a shame they went extinct.
- But how are we supposed to get Fry's money out of the bank?
- What?
- That's a good boy.
- Don't worry, Miss Anderson, this won't take long. Now, your motivation is you're
  back in the year 2000 and your head's still on your body, and you want a cheese
  pizza.
- More like 4.3 billion!
- Ow!
- The machine is working at full capacity.
- So they do whatever you want? No wonder you love Mother's Day.
- Why's that, Ma?
- Gee, Ma. You're not a bitter -
- Hmm!
- She commands them with a remote control she keeps in her...(whispering) bra.
- (whispering) Bra.
- You can get there using this precious, non-computerised map.
- Here. Give her these.
- Ow!
- Ow!
LEELA:
- As long as it's not about my eye.
- Is it about my eye?
- Just ask the question.
- I'm an alien, alright? Now let's drop the subject.
- No, I just work here.
- Yep. It's December 31st 2999.
- I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you.
- Well, at least here you'll be treated with dignity. Now strip naked and get on the
  probulator.
- Interesting. Your DNA test shows one living relative. He's your great great great
  great great great great...
- '...great great great great great nephew.'
- Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
- Your permanent career assignment.
- Take your hands off me! You've been assigned the job you're best at just like everyone
  else.
- Then you'll be fired...
- '...out of a cannon into the Sun!'
- Well that's tough! Lots of people don't like their jobs but we do them anyway. You
  gotta do what you gotta do! Now hold out your hand, I'm gonna implant your career
  chip. It'll permanently label you as a delivery boy.
- Hold still, damnit. I don't have good depth perception!  You've got until the count
  of five to let me out of here. One...
- '...two, three -- Hey!'
- Shut up, Terry.
- Look, he's just a nobody who doesn't want to be a delivery boy. I'd really rather
  not force it on him.
- This is officer 1B-DI requesting back-up.
- Hmm.
- I'm sorry, Fry, but I have to install your career chip.
- It's my job. You gotta do what you gotta do!
- Watch it!
- Please, officers, there's no need to use force.
- Oh, come on, he's just a poor kid from the Stupid Ages.
- No-one makes fun of my nose.
- You guys were totally out of control.
- Open up!
- Wait!
- Look, I know it's not much consolation but I understand how you feel.
- I understand. I'm the only one-eyed alien on this whole planet. My parents abandoned
  me here as a baby and I don't even know what galaxy they were from. I know how it
  feels to be alone.
- Quitting.
- Because I've always wanted to. I just never realised it before I met you.
- Hey, he stole my ring!
- I don't wanna spoil the party but we're all job deserters now. We're unemployed
  and we have nowhere to go.
- Can't we get away in the ship?
- I can. As long as I don't have to parallel park.
- Prepare for lift-off. Ten.
- One!
- Thanks for the offer, Professor, but we don't have the proper career chips.
- Well, if you don't like that try some Archduke Chocula.
- (reading) Death by airlock failure.
- (reading) Death by brain parasite.
- (reading) Death by sonic diarrhoea?
- Look, I don't know about any of your previous captains but I intend to do as little
  dying as possible.
- Ow!
- Hang on. Amy Wong? Of the Mars Wongs?
- Uh-huh! What sorority do you belong to?
- Nowhere special. The moon.
- Well...I guess so. Just be careful. I'd like to hold off any major screwups until
  at least my second day as captain.
- Huh? Oh sure, knock yourself out.
- OK we're here!
- Relax, its open till 9.
- Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
- OK, if everyone's finished being stupid --
- We'll deliver that crate like professionals and then we'll go home.
- Alright. We'll deliver that crate like professionals...and then we'll go ride the
  bumper cars.  Amy, why don't you help Fry hoist down the crate. Then lock up when
  you're done. Just be careful.
- Who buys this trash?
- What's wrong, Fry?
- But the phoney stuff is what's fun. It's boring out there.
- Maybe I should take Fry on the Luna Rover ride. You get to wear a space suit and
  drive around on the surface. And the line's short because it's educational.
- Wow, I never realised the first astronauts were so fat!
- (singing) ...and sing a whaling tune. We're whalers on the moon...
- Oh, really? I don't see you with a fungineering degree! p>
- Fry, no. This is my first mission and I'm not gonna let us get in any trouble. Besides,
  the car's on a track.
- OK, you're on the surface. Now I'll give you 10 minutes. Then you'll get bored,
  turn around and apologise for being such a jerk. Agreed?
- Time's up. Make a U-turn at the next crater.
- That's crazy! It's been lost for centuries!
- No. Now we're gonna die.
- Thank God!
- Our car broke down and we're out of oxygen. Can we borrow some?
- Fry, night lasts two weeks on the moon.
- I told you to turn around and go back to the park. But oh, no, the park was too
  phoney. We had to see the real moon.
- Fry, face it. The moon is a dump. It's a boring dried up wasteland. And the only
  reason anybody ever comes here is for the tacky little amusement park. Can't you
  just accept that?
- Bender?
- Hang on. Hang on. Jump.  Hold on to your helmet!
- Nightfall's coming.  Hurry, before we freeze.
- We can't outrun it forever.
- Quick, get in.
- Fry, look around. It's just a crummy plastic flag and a dead man's tracks in the
  dust.  Now get in here before you freeze.
- Well if the oxygen holds out we might live long enough to starve to death.
- That's right, you shouldn't have. I still don't get what the big attraction is.
- A week would be a little much.
- Fry, look. It really is beautiful. I don't know why I never noticed before.
- Amy? Where'd she learn to operate the controls like that?
- So, Fry, was the real moon anything like the moon you used to dream about?
- What the hell are you doing?! You're getting a huge dose of radiation!
- Do you know how long it's going to take me to recalibrate these engines?
- Professor, We need to talk to you about Fry.
- He's a nice guy but we think it's about time he got his own place.
- We've all talked it over and --
- Fry, sometimes in close quarters, people do inconsiderate things without realising
  it.
- No, Fry, by "close quarters" I mean this office...
- '...and by "people" I mean you!'
- And by "inconsiderate" I mean --
- We sure are cheerful this morning.
- What happened to you?
- Look at yourself. You're a wreck! You've got to find a new place to live.
- Love your optimism, Fry. But seriously, you've got to tell Bender you're moving
  out.
- What if I just helped the two of you find a bigger apartment?
- At least it's got a great view.
- Wow! Now this is fantastic!
- Was his apartment rent-controlled?
- Wow, this is beautiful.
- It's not crap.
- Happy housewarming, Fry!  It's a miniature fruit salad tree.
- You had cable. This is satellite.
- Fry, you're Bender's best friend. How could you let that mob kick him out?
- Only when he's in them and you know it. You really hurt his feelings.
- Bender's not a guy, he's a robot.
- Bender?  My God, you're a mess!
- Look at that five o'clock rust. You've been up all night not drinking, haven't you?
- Please, Bender. Have some malt liquor. If not for yourself then for the people who
  love you.
- Oh, now look. It's obvious you miss being Fry's roommate. But there's got to be
  a better way to deal with this.
- Well, if that would work.
- Wait! I want you to look me in the eye and promise you won't get behind the wheel
  without some kind of alcoholic beverage in your hand.
- I can't just stand by and be silent about Bender anymore.
- Well I can't just do that anymore. Your best friend is out there somewhere destroying
  himself.
- He doesn't care about the apartment, he cares about you. And you turned your back
  on him.
- Bender! Stop!
- Fry, don't help him mutilate himself.
- You guys could learn a lesson from those two.
- Wait a minute! You did it all backwards. Fry's the one who should be......Oh, never
  mind!
- This place was a great choice. The food is amazing. And such generous portions.
- You know, Doug, most guys are put off by my eye. It's nice to finally meet someone
  who's open-minded.  Ew!
- "I don't know. Something I couldn\x92t quite put my finger on. Possibly his vile\
  \ lizard tongue."
- There's nothing wrong with having high standards. Now can we please stop --
- Thank you all for the inspiring advice, but I'm perfectly happy with my life the
  way it is.
- I don't know. Maybe?
- What?! How can you tell?
- There's no such thing.
- That's great - really - but he's just not what I'm looking for.
- Could you guys please stop talking about my personal life?
- Animals?
- Wait! What about the animals?
- Yes, but what about the animals?
- The animals.
- So we have to bring back two of each kind. Just like Noah's Ark.
- Do you mind?
- Thank you. But I don't care how many eyes a man has - as long as it's less than
  five. All I'm looking for is a guy who's adventurous, self-confident...
- '...maybe a snappy dresser.'
- Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship.
- Uh-huh!
- They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly saved the Octillian system from a horde
  of rampaging Killbots.
- He's the most decorated captain in the whole Democratic Order Of Planets.
- No I don't. But I think we ought to meet with him and see if he'll help us rescue
  those animals.
- Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet Express delivery ship. We've come aboard
  to plead for your assistance.
- Oh, not at all. I'm just so uh...really thrilled to meet you!
- (flattered) You don't mean that!
- Captain Brannigan, we really need to talk to you about our mission.
- We're hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6 from extinction. And if you could just
  --
- Wait! What's wrong?
- But people already interfered. That planet was mined completely hollow.
- This doesn't make any sense.
- Fine! We'll save the animals without your help.
- Ow! I might've liked Zapp Brannigan if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw me
  in prison.
- Good. This will be my chance to reason with him, captain to captain.
- I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer.
- Captain...
- '...if we could speak seriously for a moment...'
- '...I''d like you to reconsider letting us rescue those animals.'
- What?
- I'm not really in the mood.
- Can I please just go back to prison?
- Much rather!  What are you doing?
- No, and it's pronounced "sham-pane".
- Its not a big deal.
- Oh, forget it.
- It comes with the job.
- Oh, come on, cheer up, it's not that bad.
- Uh, listen, Zapp.
- Zapp, last night was a mistake.
- No, just a regular mistake. For a split second my common sense was overwhelmed by
  pity.
- The only kind of crawling I'm doing to you is away - from!
- Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to save those animals whether you like it or not.
- Threaten all you -- wait, what?
- Eurgh!
- (defensively) Nothing.
- (defensively) We just talked, OK?!
- Alright. We don't have much time to collect these animals. The planet is supposed
  to collapse in approximately two hours ago.
- Hello there.  Hmm, he doesn't seem to be on the checklist.
- No! I don't care how hilarious your apron is, we're not cooking him.  Aww, I'll
  call him Nibbler.
- I hope he'll be OK in there with all those big animals.
- Good. That's the last species.
- Nibbler!
- Leave him alone. It's not his fault that he's an unstoppable killing machine. Is
  it, snoogums?
- Prepare for lift-off.  We're out of fuel. Bender, I told you to fill the tank before
  we left.
- No way, forget it! I refuse to go crawling back to him!
- (defensively) Nothing. We just talked.
- That's enough. Don't you think I feel bad enough already?
- Alright, alright I'll call him.  I mean if living is that important to you.
- Hello, Zapp?
- Zapp, we're out of fuel...
- '...and Vergon 6 is about to implode. We need your help.'
- Bird's don't crawl.
- Look, are you going to rescue us or not?
- (sexfully) Please...
- '...Big Z?'
- I would never abandon a helpless animal. Y'know, Zapp, once I thought you were a
  big pompous buffoon. Then I realised that inside you were just a pitiful child.
  But now I realise that outside that child is a big pompous buffoon!
- Uh, I guess to sit here and wait for death.
- I don't believe it! It's dark matter.
- His species must've filled the entire planet with it. Did you do that, you cute
  little --  Come on. That should be more than enough fuel to get us outta here. Bender,
  pick it up and put it in the engine.
- We made it!  And some of the animals survived.
- (thinking) Dear Captain's Diary. I may not have found love on this mission but I
  did find a cute little companion who excretes starship fuel. And that's just as
  good.
- What do you think of the view, Fry?
- Face it, Fry. Baseball was as boring as mom and apple pie. That's why they jazzed
  it up.
- It's traditional. Just like aluminium bats and the seventh inning grope.
- Except for the word "blern" that was complete gibberish.
- Alright! Yes! Miller's on a pace to hit 70 blerns!
- Exactly! He was a machine designed to hit blerns! I mean, come on, Wireless Joe
  was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels.
- Yep.
- Hey, hold on. I understand these robots hate humans, but how do they feel about
  humanoid aliens?
- This is the first actual work you've ever had to do around here.
- Oh, come on, Bender. Last month it was Robomadom and before that Robonza.
- OK, Bender, we're here. It's time to get to work.
- 'Now we can''t land on the surface because those robots will kill Fry and me. So
  we''ll have to stay up here and lower you with the winch. And remember: You don''t
  know humans, you don''t work for humans, and, above all, you don''t like humans.'
- Hmm, he seems pretty angry.
- Maybe we ought to do something nice for him.
- There! This oughta show that stupid robot we care about him.
- No, we can't! They'll kill us on sight.
- I don't know! I don't know! It's not an easy decision. If only I had two or three
  minutes to think about it.
- OK. If we're going to save Bender, we've got to look and act exactly like robots.
- We'll have to walk like robots, talk like robots and, if necessary, solve complex
  differential equations like robots.
- 'Fry, first of all this is serious. And second of all:'
- Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's in this quadrant.
- Robot...we be.
- Then we'll go with that data file.
- Now if you see any robots, just stay out of their way.  (shouting) So far, so good.
- Have you seen this robot?
- Come on, Fry, walk like a robot.
- Robots don't have bathrooms.
- Listen. Just go behind those garbage cans. I'll stand guard.
- Hurry up, Fry!
- I'm sorry. My friend and I have to go and perform some mindless repetitive tasks.
- Quick! Let's duck in here!
- Mine's not working.
- OK. Keep an eye out for Bender.
- What's that?
- Try to stay with the crowd so no one notices how crummy you look.
- Good for you. Now let's all get back to the ship.
- Yeah! I mean he might not have a case but I'm genuinely not a human.
- 'Look! One eye! Count them: One! Not human!'
- Are you alright?
- Who are you?
- What's going on here?
- He'll do it. He's crazy!
- Of course.
- Of course.
- Didn't you have ads in the 20th century?
- I'd love to chip in, but Bender stole my wallet.
- I know Fry's rich, but do we really have to wear these top hats?
- I know you spent a lot of money on this place, Fry, but it's awfully primitive.
  The floors are made of such hard wood.
- That's cute!
- I just don't get it. Who was this Ted Danson? And why would you pay $10,000 for
  his skeleton?
- You're just saying that because he bought you that antique robot toy.
- Are you crazy? It's a can of old fish.
- Oh, my God, it's Mom! I've never seen her in person before.
- Fry, you can't bid against Mom. She's the richest, most powerful person in the world.
  And she's so adorable.
- Fry? Are you there?
- You haven't been to work in three days. What have you been doing?
- You can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.
- Fry, this isn't healthy. You're living in the past.
- But we're your friends and we live here in the year 3000.
- Fry please.   My ponytail's caught in the door.
- Since when do you care about us?
- Goodbye-eee!
- You're Fry's relative. Do you have any idea how he got so crazy?
- You did? What happened?
- It's Mom.
- Is that a cooking show?
- Bender! I didn't know you liked cooking! That's so cute!
- I know you like cooking shows but you're a robot, you don't even have a sense of
  taste.
- Among other things.
- Fry, you have to be more careful. We're not in the 20th century. You don't know
  how things work here.
- What's this spice for?
- Oh! That's ridiculous. (whispering) I'll take two pounds!
- Hey, have you seen Fry?
- What the hell were you doing? I warned you to stay away from those guys.
- Uh, Professor, are we even allowed in the Forbidden Zone?
- Uh, Professor...
- (whispering) Listen, this is Bender's first meal and he's a little sensitive. So
  let's be supportive, OK?
- (shouting) Oh, dear God!
- OK, Fry, here's the package to deliver and for once in your life be careful. This
  is my first visit to the Galaxy Of Terror and I'd like it to be a pleasant one.
- Don't touch anything or talk to anyone. Just go to the palace, drop it off and come
  right back.
- So after I specifically asked you not to touch anything, you drank a bottle of strange
  blue liquid? It could have been poisonous acid!
- That's it, Fry. As your captain I order you back to the ship. You are in way over
  your head.
- Does anyone else think it's odd that a shiftless 25-year-old delivery boy could
  drop out of the sky, kill the emperor and be rewarded instead of punished?
- (whispering) Fry, I have to talk to you. You're in terrible danger.
- You see Emperor Plon here?  He met his end when he was drunk by Emperor Strug. And
  before he could even wipe his mouth, Strug was drunk by Shwab.
- Look at all these guys. Do you have any idea what the average length of their reigns
  was?
- No. One week.
- Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one. And guess who's
  next?
- You're in tremendous danger, you idiot! Half of these Emperors were drunk at their
  own coronation.
- No, they were assassinated. In fact, the law says you'll be killed on the spot if
  you fail to recite the oath from memory.
- That is completely reckless. Don't you ever think ahead?
- I give up! You're gonna get yourself killed and this time I won't be here to save
  you.
- That's it! I'm never helping you again! If anyone except you needs me, I'll be in
  the ship.
- I'll accept.
- I like you.
- I don't know why I should. I mean after what he --
- What are you talking about?
- Of course I'm alive.
- Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out of this if you're willing to let me help you.
- I know. Amy, get the bottle.
- Come on. Everybody help out Fry.
- How we doing, Amy?
- Does it really work?
- Uh, Professor...?
- I don't get it.
- I think it's moving.
- Fry, what the hell were you people thinking back then? How could you just throw
  your garbage away?
- We recycle everything. Robots are made from old beer cans.
- And that sandwich you're eating is made of old discarded sandwiches.  Nothing just
  gets thrown away.
- Typical 20th century attitude.
- Those things are all from the 19th century.
- Can't we just shoot a missile at it?
- That's all? But --
- Odour at magnitude 8.  Magnitude 12. Magnitude 31.  We're breaking up. Turn on the
  anti-smell device.
- Look at all this filth.
- Fry, this stuff was garbage when it was new. Let's blow it up already!
- Let's see. If that's Hypodermic Ridge then the bomb must go right here.  Get ready
  to run. We've got 25 minutes. Uh, 15 minutes.  5 minutes.  6h minutes?
- That idiot! It wasn't set for 25 minutes, it was set for 52 seconds.
- Hey, watch it! You'll put somebody's eye out!
- Yeah, but this garbage ball's unstoppable now. New New York is done for.
- That rat! Do something!
- But where can we find a substance the exact density and consistency as garbage?
- Just fire the damn thing.
- Should we really be celebrating? I mean, what if the second garbage ball returns
  to Earth like the first one did?
- Impressive. They're busting mad rhymes with an 80% success rate.
- Ow! Hey, watch it!
- If I didn't know better I'd almost think he was abusing electricity.
- Bender, why are you spending so much time in the bathroom? Are you jacking on in
  there?
- Did he use his tongue?
- Uh oh. There seems to be some sort of electrical disturbance in the Coalsack Nebula.
- Electrical. Anyway it's going to take some careful piloting to avoid it.
- We're out of control. We're heading straight into the electric field!
- Bender, we didn't mind your drinking, or your kleptomania, or your pornography ring.
- But this electricity abuse crossed the line. You almost killed us.
- Give him a break, Fry. If this helps Bender clean up his act then I think we should
  be supportive.
- This is unbelievable. The old Bender never would have taken us out to dinner.
- What are you doing to my ship?
- Amen.
- And I think I know a way to do it. We have to reacquaint him with a little thing
  called "sleaze".
- Uh, here.
- Hey, great idea!
- Hey, Bender, looks at that woman's purse. It's hanging by a spaghetti strand.
- Go nuts.
- What in hell happened to Bender?
- Hmm. Look! It's the symbol of Bender's old religion.
- Who would've thought hell would really exist? And that it would be in New Jersey!
- (singing) It's up to us to rescue him.
- (singing) It's us who tempted him to sin.
- (singing) Come on, Fry, don't be scared,
- Alright, Beelzebot, what'll it take to get our friend back?
- Wait. What fiddle contest?
- (whispering) Do you know how to play the fiddle?
- (whispering) No, but I used to play the drums. They're sorta similar. (talking)
  What happens if we lose?
- We'll do it.
- Time for the drum solo!
- Hurry, Bender!
- Oh, sorry.
- Uh, do you think you could be just little less evil than that.
- That was the worst delivery ever.
- Vacation?
- Looks nice.
- Oh, God! Not Zapp Brannigan!
- Let's just say we've "crossed paths".
- "It's tempting, but, uh, I have a fianc\xE9 now. Uh, hmm, uh, hmm, uh, we--, uh\
  \ ...  Him! Fry, darling, meet Zapp Brannigan."
- This is it.
- Take it off or I'll break it off.
- Well, our accommodations aren't great but it sure is beautiful our here.
- "Fry, just be quiet. I'm beginning to think this whole fake fianc\xE9 thing was\
  \ a terrible, terrible--"
- Uh, look, before you get any crazy ideas, that was for Zapp.
- Alright, can we try not to complicate this?
- It would have been nice if you'd told me you were going out with Amy.
- What? No. No! Of course not!
- But I didn't even limbo.
- Amy!
- (whispering) What are we gonna do? Fry can't pretend to be both our boyfriends.
- I didn't run off. I had plenty of time to finish eating and stroll away while you
  were kissing Amy.
- Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two eyes, you have two eyes.
- Nice nebula.
- Look's like everybody's got somebody. Except me.
- What was that?  Oh, my God! We're heading straight into a black hole.
- OK. We just have to get from here to the escape pods.
- Come on, before its too late!
- Hurry! The escape pods should be just ahead!
- It won't move. And the door release is on the other side.
- We can't leave yet. We've got to wait for Bender. The high gravity must be slowing
  down his looting.
- I don't know. But we can't wait any longer.
- Something's wrong. We're two metric tons overweight.
- But she saved all our lives. Without her, we're light enough to get away.
- In what field?
- 'They planted traditional college foliage: ivy, trees, hemp. Soon the whole planet
  was terraformed.'
- You went to college?
- Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but you don't seem like the educated type.
- Please! Everyone knows 20th century colleges were basically expensive daycare centres.
- You won't last two weeks.
- I think that's probably your roommate.
- So what makes Guenter talk?
- What you did to Guenter was cruel. At the risk of sounding like an after-school
  special, I think we learned who the real animal was today.
- Hey, what's going on? I thought you didn't like bananas.
- Besides, Guenter, you're not like other monkeys. You've got the hat.
- That's so sad. I didn't even know monkeys could cry.
- But he's not your father. That guy in the punch bowl was your father.
- So he just ran away in the middle of the exam?
- 'Nuh-uh, I''m staying out of this. Now here''s my opinion: What we should do is...'
- I said we'll go to the jungle and let Guenter decide once and for all.
- I see some movement up there. I think it's him.
- Oops.
- Professor, you'll offer Guenter the hat and, Fry, you'll offer him the banana. We'll
  let him choose whether he wants to be intelligent or just a mindless animal.
- Wait, what's that sound?
- No! No!
- Not there.
- (shouting) Help us, Guenter!
- Oh, no! Hurry, Guenter, climb up the vine. You can still save yourself.
- Who's up for one last summer beach trip?
- Fry, you're wasting your life sitting in front of that TV. You need to get out and
  see the real world.
- Everyone's too polite to say anything but you're covered with bed sores.
- Just get in the car.
- They are now. In the 2600's New Yorkers elected a super-villain governor, and he
  stole most of the world's monuments.
- No. I'm not attracted to bullies. No matter how big and ...  ... handsome they are.
- Fry! Although I suppose we could go for a walk along the beach.
- It's very nice. We should get a picture before the tide comes in.
- Oh, my God!
- The Earth is under attack. Can't we just forget about that?
- 'Well, you heard the windbag: We''ve been drafted. Everyone into the ship.'
- Thanks, but I'm not technically human.
- Maybe we should wait 'til afterwards, in case neither of us comes back.
- Fry, this isn't TV, it's real life. Can't you tell the difference?
- Bender, damage report.
- We did it! We won!
- This is hopeless.  If we're gonna get blown to bits, we might as well do it in the
  comfort of our own home.
- You do not, you big fat liar. You don't know anyone. All you do is watch TV.
- They're going to destroy the entire Earth if they don't see some stupid TV show
  about some bimbo lawyer?
- 'Uh-uh, forget it. A: I''m camera shy, and B: I get tongue tied in front of an audience
  armed with death rays.'
- Gimme the script.
- Your Honour, I move for a mistrial, on the grounds that I'm also having a hot, naked
  affair with the foreman of this jury.
- Sleeping with you.
- Uh, g-- uh, getting back to the, uh, matter, uh-uh, if it please the court ... (whispering)
  Fry, there's nothing else here. You only wrote two pages of dialogue.
- What are we supposed to do now?
- Uh...
- I say ... I'm giving up the law.  And I'm giving up being single. Your Honour, will
  you marry me?
- Why not? It's clever, it's unexpected.
- "(reading) I will now make my closing statement. With my fianc\xE9 deceased ...\
  \ ... I hereby return to my single female lawyer career. No matter what any man\
  \ says."
- I've never seen anyone so addicted to Slurm.
- Bender, what's wrong?
- You poor baby. Let me check if you have a fever.  Ow!
- Hey, what's rattling around in there?
- Fry, are you alright?
- Ooh, look at that!
- Hey, look! The disgusting little men are starting to sing.
- Hey, what's behind that door?
- Is it the secret ingredient?
- I was just curious because of the armed guards.
- What are you doing?
- No. That's moronic.
- Bender, why did you jump in?
- Where are we?
- Something's rotten on the planet Wormulon. Look at this.
- This all must have something to do with the secret ingredient.
- 'No. There''s already a soda like that: Soylent Cola.'
- It varies from person to person.
- (whispering) Quick.
- It's the end of the line. This must be where they put in the secret ingredient.
- Blech!
- Fry!  Fry!
- That's the only ingredient of Slurm.
- The exit! We made it.
- You wish, you slimy worm! Heyya!
- How can you trick people into drinking something that comes out of your behind?
  It's disgusting.
- Fry, untie us, quick!
- You pig. Stop stuffing your craw and save us.
- Yeah, we're boned.
- Hurry!
- We're close to the exit. I can smell those filthy orange guys.
- She's gaining on us.
- For Slurms!
- Aww! Somebody likes snouts.
- Don't yell at Nibbler like that.  You hurt his feelings. Come on, pet him and make
  up.
- I said pet him.
- Are you alright?
- Not you.  Aww, poor baby chipped a fang.
- No!
- Next time I'm keeping it.
- Aww, look how cuddly he looks in his new cape!
- Come on, let's all sing Happy Birthday!
- Bender, I thought you were supposed to be cooking for this party.
- Just make a simple cake. And this time, if someone's going to jump out of it, make
  sure you put them in after you cook it.
- Bender, what's going--  (crying) No!
- (crying) Aren't you upset at all? How would you feel if I flushed Fry down the toilet?
- (crying) You have no sympathy for anyone else's feelings.
- You do?
- (crying) I wouldn't feel so bad if Bender just understood the pain he caused me.
- I wish just once Bender could feel exactly what I feel.
- Thank you, Professor. I'm happy that Bender can finally feel my pain.
- I'm not mopey. You shut up!
- Thanks for taking me out, Amy. I feel slightly less miserable already.
- A puppy? Nibbler loved to eat puppies.
- (theatrical happiness) Sure. I'm having a great time -- really. You two go enjoy
  yourselves.
- Now he's flushed himself down the toilet? Who's he gonna flush next?
- You're right. I feel terrible.
- I guess we'd better go down into the sewers and look for him.
- There's no such thing as mutants. That's a ridiculous urban myth.
- What is it?
- OK, check the guidebook.
- Wait, what's that?
- Bender, you didn't have to come down here.
- (crying) He was so cute.
- (shouting) Nibbler?
- It's no use. We'd better turn back. Which way, Fry?
- (simultaneously) Idiot.
- (shouting) Mutants!
- Mutants! They're real!
- No, we're on the top.
- Listen. We actually came down here to find our pet, Nibbler. He got flushed down
  the toilet.
- (shouting) Nibbler?
- El Chupanibre? What's that?
- Wait. Our pet Nibbler loves fresh crocodile. It's his favourite treat. He must be
  El Chupanibre.
- You don't understand. He would never hurt people. Let us help you capture him.
- I volunteer.
- Nightfall? How can you tell down here?
- Bender, do something.
- I can't. I love every living creature.
- As a friend.
- Well, I could use a new tank top.
- A fashionable tank top. And designer boots ... encrusted with jewels.
- Yeah. And I could afford it all if I didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler.
- You know what else I could use? A weekend at one of those fancy spas. And a Toblerone.
- You did it!
- And it's all thanks to Bender. I love you, Bender.
- You know, Bender may not have learned anything from me, but I think I actually learned
  something from him.  (shouting) So long, jerkwads!
- What's the mission?
- What are we delivering?
- We'll get them there as quickly as we can.
- If you don't mind, we're here to deliver the scissors for the ribbon-cutting.
- What for?
- But they're not even sharp. Who could I possibly hurt with them?
- What?
- Dismiss all charges? Your Honour, I know the case is closed and you've rendered
  your verdict, but I wanna testify.
- That's a stupid question. What matters is Zapp Brannigan is the sorriest captain
  I've ever seen, and I saw the idiot blow up DOOP headquarters with my own eye.
- (reluctantly) Yes.
- (reluctantly) Yes.
- Zapp Brannigan.
- Alright, this is the third hose fight I've broken up today and the second one using
  actual hoses. Now move your lazy asses and start scrubbing the ship like I ordered
  you to.
- Zapp?
- I never loved you.
- What do you want?
- You don't know how to do any of those things.
- Thanks, Kif. Very nice work.
- I said "very nice work".
- OK, crew, listen up. Your job is to delivery these 40 pillows to that hotel.
- They're not heavy in here because we have an anti-grav pump. But once you get out
  on the surface the gravity will be very intense.
- I don't want any screw-ups. Use the hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow at a
  time.
- What the hell happened?
- I told you dumb apes not to overload it. Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs here.
- No way, Jack. You disobeyed an order, so now you have to deliver all 40 pillows
  by hand.
- Just get to work.
- Y'know, why don't we talk about something besides Zapp for a while?
- On what grounds, you slobbering oaf?
- You really don't want me to be captain anymore?
- But, didn't I do a good job?
- Sometimes a captain needs to do those things. Besides I, I thought we were friends.
- Let me guess. He cancelled naptime? He ran out of beer?  So he's about to kill us?
- Oh, no! He's disabled the steering. We're gonna crash!
- OK, OK. We have one chance. Are you willing to do what I say as captain?
- Even if I make you work hard?
- Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't break and load all the dark matter into the
  left engine.
- Just do it.
- Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age of 25.
- You did it! You actually did it!
- Well, actually--
- 'Your Honour, it''s all true: My female incompetence, Zapp''s cat-like reflexes,
  the stuff that made no sense, all of it.'
- No.
- Oh, alright.
- Let's mutiny!
- There's a political debate on! Quick, change the channel!
- Look, I know there are no car chases but this is important. One of these two men
  will become president of the world.
- The United States is part of the world.
- Don't let their identical DNA fool you. They differ on some key issues.
- You're not registered?
- That's not true. The first robot president won by exactly one vote.
- The point is, one vote can make a difference and even though it won't, I'm still
  taking you to get registered.
- What are you talking about?
- Bender? What happened to you?
- Fry, he opened up relations with China. He doesn't want to hear about your ding-dong.
- Bender, he's got your body!
- Nixon must have bought your body from the pawn shop.
- Ordinarily I'd say no and lecture you on how this is your own fault for being such
  an idiot. But when a robotic Nixon is on the loose, we have a duty to take action.
  Idiot.
- Come on. We've gotta find some way to talk to him.
- I've got a better plan.
- (whispering) They give you a discount if you've been here before.
- OK, almost got it. Steady. Steady. Don't panic.
- Alright, break it up, you two!
- You'll never pardon anybody because you'll never get elected president. The voters
  of Earth aren't the pea-brained idiots they were back in your time.
- The jig's up, Nixon. We'll trade you the tape for the body.
- Yes! The system works!
- No!
- Oh, crud. I knew there was something I meant to do today.
- Great idea!
- Actually it did. But thank God nuclear winter cancelled it out.
- Yeah, yeah, relax. Trees down.
- Oh, you mean Xmas. You must be using an archaic pronunciation. Like when you say
  "ask" instead of "aks".
- 'Hey, hey. Let me aks you something: Would it cheer you up if we went and cut down
  an Xmas tree?'
- That's not true.
- Sorry I stormed out before. I didn't mean to ruin everyone's Xmas.
- It's just that I get tired of Fry always only thinking of himself.
- Wait! You mean he's still out? His life's in danger!
- I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town!
- Hi there!
- You didn't need to buy me a present, Fry.
- It's OK. You're lonely and I'm lonely. But together we're lonely together.
- Merry Xmas.
- But we set things right. Fry even risked his life to get me a present.
- We're trapped.
- Goodbye, Fry.
- (shouting) Somebody help us.
- (shouting; from outside) Help!
- Watch out! His belly is shaking like a bowl full of nitro-glycerine!
- Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but you've become a fat sack of crap.
- Come on. We're taking you pigs to the gym.
- Uh, Fry, you're in the womens' steam room.
- Those poor 20th century women.
- Hmm, somebody must have turned down the gravity. I'll fix it for you.
- Maybe you could do more rips with less weight.
- I wonder why Dr. Zoidberg is acting this way. Out of all of us he always seemed
  the most normal.
- (simultaneously) Stop!
- Bleck!
- Fry, do you even understand the word "invertebrate"?
- It's amazing that your people can fall in love so fast.
- Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?
- At least you didn't smell as bad as them.
- If a guy ever did that to me I'd know it. Wait a second. They've all been doing
  that to me. Even Sean!
- Uh, me too.
- Zoidberg said some dumb stuff but he's a nice guy, really. It's just that Fry's
  been telling him what to say and Fry's a ... do you have idiots on your planet?
- Yeah ... What? Look, never mind the words. Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor honey.
- Dr. Zoidberg, this is madness. You're being irrational.
- Aww.
- Right, right.  You have to stop this madness.
- (shouting) Come on, Fry! Die with dignity!
- Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone.
- Ew!
- Fry!
- Hooray!
- I'll get my coat. Let's go, Bender.
- Uh-huh. Now tell us she's witty and sophisticated.
- OK, the sticker says 55,000 but we'll only go as high as say--
- Amy, you don't go up from the sticker price.
- Hermes. Who were you yelling at?
- You just assume I can't get a Valentine's date?
- Bender! Romance isn't about money.
- For your information, it's because he's hideous.
- Bender, this is stupid. Why would anyone come to you for romantic help?
- You'll be back to zero soon enough.
- Fry--!
- I think you're over reacting.
- Fry, she's pulling down billionaire trust-fund money.
- This sort of thing always happens with office romances.
- So, how's business?
- Yeah, it's pathetic alright!  How much?
- Done.
- No!
- You're too late, Fry. I'm sharing Valentine's Day with a very special man. He's
  not Zapp Brannigan or anything!
- Bender's in his office.
- Nice ass, ass.
- (whispering) Bender! Did you just round up our dates at the bus station?
- 'Why, if it isn''t my favourite head on Amy''s body: Fry.'
- Nonsense, the evening's young. So, Gary, what do you do for a living?
- Really? Y'know I heard that banking industry regulations are really very simple.
- Oh, I do.
- So how's the old corpse? Everything hooked up OK?
- Anytime. I actually enjoyed hanging out with you.
- Come on! It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so we'd spend
  Valentine's Day together.
- No! You didn't! You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station and pocketed
  our money!
- Yeah.
- Hey Bender, I thought you said you were in this episode.
- Sounds like your kinda place Fry. Wanna go?
- But Bender you are -
- Ooo, ancient Wall Street.
- Do you know what it means?
- What were they used for?
- Oh. I-I'll be out in a sec.
- (reading) Tokens only. (talking) How does this work?
- What's this?  Another bathroom?
- Wow! The burial chamber of the 20th century's greatest spiritual leader - Al Sharpton.
- It says he was mummified in ceremonial vestments.
- Fry, remember when I told you about always ending your stories a sentence earlier?
- Did you drive much in the 20th century Fry?
- You can't have whiplash, you don't have a neck.
- Oh I get it, this is cute. You're jealous of Bender's new friend!
- It's beautiful.
- Uh Professor, can we discuss this somewhere else?
- That's kinda pathetic.
- Not me.
- Space banditos have been operating in this quadrant so you'll each take 8-hour shifts
  guarding the safe. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
- OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
- OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
- What is it?  My God! Did you hear maracas?
- Then it wasn't space banditos.  Bender, lock down the ship, don't let Flexo escape.
- How could Flexo have stolen the atom?
- No.
- Well you were sure right about Flexo being evil.
- OK, thanks Bender. Let's fan out and look for him.
- (whispering) Keep an eye on Fry. We can't rule out the possibility that he did it.
- Aha!
- Fry? Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?
- Well, looks like Flexo got away clean.
- He must have jumped ship with the atom the second we landed.
- (whispering) Downplay the tiara.
- 200,000?
- But Mr Barker -
- Well gentlemen, it appears we're boned.
- Get him!
- I don't know which one to shoot.
- Alright, enough of this.  There's the atom!
- I'm sorry we suspected you Flexo. It's just, what with the beard and all.
- It figures. Who else but Zapp Brannigan would be judging the most chauvinistic,
  degrading, dehumanising -
- Wait, you're making a -  Ooo! Look at that.  I feel like a princess.
- I almost had that tiara.
- Fry, that's a radiator.
- Good to see you.
- (whispering) Shh! You're gonna get us all assimilated!
- Nah. I'm not in the mood for a historical documentary. I've heard good things about
  Quizblorg, Quizblorg.
- Bender, do you know who that was?
- No! You've got to do it. I don't care how suicidal it is.
- This is more important than that marble-eating contest, Fry! It's about pride. Let
  me tell you a story from my childhood.
- When I was growing up at the orphanarium, I got picked on a lot...
- (voice-over) ...My only outlet was Arcturan Kung Fu.
- But, Master Fnog, I can beat these dorks with one eye closed.
- What do you mean? Watch this!
- That's it. I'll take you on right now.
- I lost my chance to be a champion. I won't let you throw away yours.
- Let's see what you got. Touch your toes.
- Get up, Bender. You can't quit every time you get an axe in the back.  Or a drill
  through your face. Now quit scratching your axe-hole and get out there.
- Bender! You're three hours late. You can't give up on your training now after both
  of us worked so hard.
- I said "us".
- No way! If you wouldn't take my help when you didn't need it, why should I give
  it to you now when you do need it?
- I don't know. But I'm not helping.
- Not Fnog! Bender, let's hit the gym. I'm gonna teach you to fight like a girl!
- According to the script, you're supposed to prance out and tickle him with your
  fairy wand. Instead, I want you to prance out and kick his head off!
- Keep laughing, Fnog!  Ready, Bender?
- OK, Fnog, that's enough. Call him off. Fnog?  Hmm.
- So, once more we meet again.
- You didn't train Destructor. You're just controlling him like a puppet. I mean,
  cheating in a fake fight. That's low!
- (ironic) Oh, right. Girls lack the will of the warrior!
- Yes!
- I'm proud of you, Bender. Sure, you lost. You lost bad. But the important thing
  is I beat up someone who hurt my feelings in high school.
- It smells like burning recess monkey.
- Follow me!
- It's got every piece of information anyone could ever want.
- Hey!
- Yeah. I'll stick with this one thank you.
- I'm a woman if that's what you mean. I don't like to play games so I'll just say
  I'm a cyclops, I'm a spaceship captain, I'm the only one of my species and I'm interested
  in meeting a man.
- We call it a "video game."
- Who are you?
- I can't believe it. I've dreamed of this moment all my life.
- Fry, you idiot. Ever since I was abandoned on Earth I've been searching for who
  my people are and where they come from. Then I finally meet another Cyclops and
  you blast him. You wrecked my one chance to learn who I am.
- Come on. We have worked to do.
- No, I'm just happy you were able to win a video game. Now lets concentrate on getting
  this desperately needed popcorn to the people of Cineplex 14 OK?
- Huh?  It's him!
- It'll get there.
- After a whole life of searching I may finally have found where I belong.
- Look at that statue. It's only got one eye.
- Alkazar?  Are you real? Or am I seeing single?
- After all this time. Somebody else with one eye who isn't a clumsy carpenter or,
  uh, a kid with a BB gun.
- Not at all!
- There's so much information and yet somehow I feel as if I know it all already.
- Oh please! Really?
- Fry, that's offensive to our people. Isn't it?
- Oh no not at all. If anything, I'm more impressed.
- It's all so sad. What happened to our people?
- I heard you from my room. What's wrong?
- Please, is it bout the fate of our people? Because I'm very interested in that.
- Alkazar, I used to be a baby, it might have been me!
- It's so tragic.
- It doesn't have to.
- You're a male and I'm a female.
- Wake up my king.
- Uh, sure OK. What do you take with that?
- Maybe after breakfast we can talk about rebuilding our civilisation.
- No.
- Look Alkazar.
- Look Al. I know you've been living alone a long time and I can sympathise but I'm
  not your maid.
- OK OK, I'll do the dishes.  Hey where'd they go?
- Al? I did my hair the way you wanted it.  Who are these people?
- Hey, where'd you get this couch and that TV set and all this stuff?
- 'Too bad they weren''t giving away the three things you actually need: Mouthwash,
  a back wax and stain-proof underwear.'
- Come on Al, can't you let the little guy out?
- Why were you sneaking into my people's forbidden valley?
- I know.
- Fry if it's obvious to you with your learning disability then of course it's obvious
  to me! He's crude and gross and he treats me like a slave.
- I can't. If I leave Alkazar then that's the end of the Cyclops race. And I won't
  let that happen. Even if that means a lifetime of unhappiness.
- I'll break up with him at dinner.
- I'm trying.
- Yes! I Will!
- Animals go in the corner.
- Look Fry I'd like to help you but it's my wedding and I'm kind of busy.  Here, try
  to be happy for me. That way at least one of us will be.
- I..d -
- Who's she?
- A little. That's why I've decided to hurt you until you explain it.
- Yeah!
- But why did you have all five weddings on the same day?
- Alright Alkazar, I just have one last question for you.
- If you can change form, why didn't you change it in the one place that counts?
- Thanks for saving me from that creep Fry.
- I guess I was so desperate to find out who I really was, I forgot who I really was.
- Yeah. I mean, how many planets can there be?
- I'm having a poker game tonight with some friends from my old cryogenics job. You
  guys interested?
- We're playing poker. but I'm warning you, my friends are serious players.
- Hermes, wait! We're having a poker party. Stay and whip off a batch of your famous
  jerk dip.
- Ah that must be my old boss.
- I know.
- But you never wore your ring. I didn't know you had a wife.
- Fry got his head stuck in a crater.
- I can explain.
- What?
- Co-pilot? Under who?
- That drunk?!
- Bender, what happened to you?
- You and Morgan were having an affair?
- Well, those arguments aside, we're still going.
- Then we'll need a guide. Someone who's been there before.
- Come on, I have a better idea.
- Excuse me? We're from the Planet Express delivery company. We're here to deliver
  a robot.
- While you're crashing, could you tell us where all these canisters end up?
- OK.
- Where is it?
- We're getting nowhere slowly. Here, I'll address this to the Central Filing room.  Then
  we'll track it using my wrist-lojack-amater.
- This is it. We'll just run in, grab Bender's disk and run out. Got it?
- But how did you know we were here?
- That's only four minutes from now.
- Whatever you did Professor, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation.
- No Professor, it's a surprise party for your 150th birthday.
- No it isn't. You have another 10 years left.
- No, he couldn't. When you turn 160, robots from the Sunset Squad take you to a mysterious
  planet and you never return.
- What?
- Look, the Professor trusts me with a giant spaceship. He wouldn't trust the rest
  of you with his dentures.
- Uh, Professor?
- Yes, we know.
- Wait, if he's your clone then why doesn't his nose look like yours?
- Never.
- Why you little -!
- Quiet. I think I know how to find the Professor.
- If the smelloscope can pick up the Professor's odour, we may have a chance to save
  him.
- I'm zeroing in on him.  Bengay...mothballs......letters to the editor. It's the
  Professor!
- There it is! The Near-Death Star!
- OK, we'll tell them the Professor escaped and we're bringing him back. Fry, you'll
  have to dress up like a 160 year old man.
- Now they may ask for a DNA sample.
- Your medicare dollars at work.
- Uh, this is Professor Hubert Farnsworth. He escaped.
- Sounds nice.
- At least it keeps them from driving.
- Brace yourself for the worst.
- He's hooked up to a life-support system. We have to disconnect him very very carefully,
  or the shock could kill him.
- We're probably going to make it, but we might not.
- They've blown out one of our engines!
- Only the Professor knows how to fix it. We have to wake him up.
- We can't you bastard, no one knows how it works. It's impossible.
- All right!
- It's a hundred times more horrible than anything I could imagine.
- Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know you cared about Nibbler.
- The sun, the sea air, good friends.
- Bender!
- I'm afraid you're both out of your league, boys, 'cause you're looking at a woman
  who owns her own harpoon.
- OK.
- Aha!  Gather round, chumps! I got the winner!
- Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times heavier than a boot.
- Wake up, everyone! I've got something. And this time it's alive!  Dr. Zoidberg,
  since when do you even wear boots?
- Come on, let's go home.
- Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and let's go.
- It's pulling us under! Everyone into the ship!
- Depth at 45 hundred feet, 48 hundred, 50 hundred! 5000 feet!
- We'll be crushed if we don't equalise the pressure.
- You did it, Fry!
- There, good as new! Except we're three miles below the surface, we don't have any
  food and the ship won't work underwater.
- OK, everyone, calm down. The Professor and I will get to work on the ship. Bender,
  Zoidberg, since you can survive underwater, you'll go out and look for food.
- Fry, swallow your food. Then talk.
- Sure she did.
- I'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean madness.
- (whispering) Ocean madness.
- Where's Fry?
- It's ocean madness alright. Sailors call it aqua dementia, the deep down crazies,
  the wet willies, the screaming moist!
- 'But tell us: How could a city with such a ... fabulous airport, end up underwater?'
- The magician?
- But, Fry, what about us? What about your life on the surface? You don't belong down
  here.
- Whatever.
- Prepare for launch.
- It's you!
- Fry, are you alright? What happened?
- (whispering) Bender, please try to be a little quieter.
- Ow! My eye! I'm blind!
- Um...a grey-ish blob?
- Um...a grey-ish blob?
- A week? What do you think Dr Zoidberg?
- I'm not deaf. I just have to wear this stupid eye patch. Does it look stupid?
- Oh yeah, this salad's fantastic.  So fresh.
- Are you kidding me?
- You're charging us? After you blinded me?
- And hard working.
- I'm here and I'm getting along just fine thank you. My walk to work today just took
  a little longer than usual. Nibbler took me through the zoo for some reason.
- I don't need help. For you information I did this all by myself.
- I'm fine thank you. A real pilot can navigate by feel alone.
- I'm taking evasive action.
- Stop bothering me Fry, I need full concentration.
- Eyesight is for chumps.
- Wait. Why do the raised letters that normally say "Turnmaster Steering company"
  say "Nibbler"? Oh no!
- The engine's stalled. I'm trying the manual fuel pump.
- You'll never get away with this.
- I'll assume that's a joke at my expense. Well, who's laughing now? Heyya!
- (whispering) That guy sounds familiar.
- Bender!
- I've got an idea. Hold still.  It's about to break, yes, yes!
- (cheering) Alright!
- Well, this is the big moment. It's finally time to take my patch off.
- I think it's Blotto. That gangster I saw when my patch fell off.  Professor? Where
  were you at 10pm last night?
- Dinner ready?
- Ugh! Great. We're two days from Earth with no food.
- Yeah. It's probably only got a Howard Johnson's.
- Well, it's a type-M planet, so it should at least have Roddenberries.
- No.
- Hm. This thing I wear on my wrist says they're not poisonous.
- No. Only what we need. Stuff the ship.
- Roger!
- We haven't thought of a name yet.
- We can't call them that.
- It sounds too much like those frozen rocky mountain oysters on a stick. You know,
  Test-cicles?
- Good idea.
- Sorry. I was distracted by those protesters outside our building.
- (shouting) What do you people want?
- You're vegetarians, who cares what you do?
- Animals eat other animals. It's nature.
- I'll go get some more bricks.
- Fry, I wish you'd throw out these week-old Popplers. They're getting big and scaly.
  Ooh, there's one left.
- Stop! Stop eating Popplers!
- Popplers are intelligent. This one called me mama.
- No!
- Sorry, babies.
- I'm telling you, it spoke to me. Come on, little Poppler, say "mama".
- (shouting) Stop eating Popplers! They can talk!
- Hey, cut it out!
- I am.
- That's not true. I have one right here that can talk.
- Come on, say "mama".
- Look, I'm saying eating meat is wrong...
- I don't think anyone's here to make that claim.
- But eating an intelligent animal is different.
- Stop it!
- Eck!
- That's stupid.
- This is all a big load. I was the one trying to save the Popplers.  You were sucking
  them down like the fat hog you are and you were stepping on them for fun.  You both
  should be in here instead of me.
- Oh, great, Captain Moron has a plan. Why don't you tell it to Wingus and Dingus
  here?
- It doesn't look anything like me. The hair is all wrong.
- You know, this might actually work. The Omicronians seem to have trouble telling
  one person from another.
- Go consummate yourself.
- Please! I just paid off my car!
- (mumbling) Yeah, it is.
- Thank you, Jrrr.  I hope you'll always think of me as your mom.
- Whoop!
- Aww, thanks, guys. Pass the veal, please.
- Dolphin? But dolphins are intelligent.
- Oh, OK.
- Pass the blowhole.
- Very nice. Where'd you steal them?
- So how are you gonna lug all those gifts to Mom's factory?
- Um, alright.
- They're so lifeless-like.
- (reading) See through the eyes of a bender unit. (talking) Fine.
- Well, see you back at the office. And don't forget to tell your mom you love her.
- The toaster's not working right, either.
- Ow! Ow!
- Look out!
- Bender, thank God you're here. Talk some sense into the other machines.
- Hey!
- (defeated) Zoidberg.
- Wait. Didn't you say Mom keeps the robot control in her bra?
- Professor, you don't have to get back together with Mom. You just have to seduce
  her, get her bra off, and use the remote to deactivate the robots.
- Leela bring fire?
- Never heard of it.
- Wouldn't it work better if the wheels were round?
- Heyya!
- I'm worried. It shouldn't take this long to get to second base.
- Too bad it didn't work out with Mom, professor.
- Maybe later. I-I mean, I don't know what to ask about.
- I can be really impulsive. It just takes me a while.  Alright, Professor! Let's
  do it. Make that machine show me what would happen if I was a little more impulsive.
  Just a little.  Not too much.
- 'Hey, you guys. Look what I bought on a wild impulse: New boots. They''re like my
  old ones but with a crazy green stripe. Woo! Never know what I''m gonna do next!'
- Hello? New boots!
- Yah!
- Oh, God! What have I done?
- OK, just try to be nonchalant.
- That doesn't prove I killed him.
- (from meeting room) Hi-yah!
- No! Everything's just--
- I'm sorry, I couldn't stop-- W-Wait. Don't you care that I murdered Hermes?
- You're blackmailing me?
- OK, that's it. No more killing! Next time you feel like killing just have a stick
  of gum.  Now to dispose of the body.
- Do you have any gum?
- Who are you?
- I've never seen you before.
- Uh, couldn't be me. I never wear boots. See?
- Could you get the lights on your way out?
- Lobster. Want some?
- Really?
- No.
- No!
- (crying) I don't know what came over me. I killed one person on impulse. Then I
  had to kill another. And another.
- And now, to make sure you won't talk, I'm gonna have to do something really impulsive!
- So, Fry, what do you think of the impulsive new me?
- Good. Now let me just get the lights.
- You idiot! We already saw that.
- What is it?
- Congratulations!
- You buy one pound of underwear and you're on their list forever.
- What is it?
- (reading) 0101100101. (talking) What does it mean?
- Bender, what happened?
- I think Bender may be telling the truth.]
- Look at this. They found those same rubbery tracks right here in New New York.  There
  was a hit-and-run by the robot porno theatre.
- That's crazy!
- There. No rampaging for you tonight.
- Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry you down, have a nice breakfast and then
  go hunt down and slaughter that ancient evil.
- Well, goodnight. I'm gonna go make my dinners for the next month and freeze them.
- (shouting) Fry, stay back!
- Could you give me some help? I think Bender crushed my foot.
- It was very sweet of you, Bender.
- Enough with the feelings, you two. If we're gonna cure Bender we've got to go back
  to the castle and hunt down the original were-car.
- Cursed, got it.
- The tracks lead here.
- Now it's daylight, so he should be in robot form. But be careful. Many robots are
  stupid and violent.
- We are not ignorant villagers, we're sophisticated New New Yorkers. Whup his butt!
- So what happened to Project Satan?
- You guys distract the were-car and I'll kill it by plugging its exhaust pipe with
  this silver potato.
- It looks so unhappy. Excuse me? Are you Project Satan?  Don't be afraid. We know
  what you are.
- Would you like us to...put you out of your misery?
- Oh no! It's midnight.
- Fry, distract him.
- Oh no, there's no exhaust pipe!
- Whoa!
- Bender, you're cured! But what happened to Fry?
- I wanna enlist. My friends always die if I'm not there to save them.
- What?!
- You know, Zapp, someone ought to teach you a lesson.
- (disguised, deeper voice) Uh, sorry, sir. I was still in attack mode. You know how
  testosterone is.
- (disguised, deeper voice) Lee --  ..la...man. La Man...Lemon! Lee Lemon, sir.
- (disguised, deeper voice) Pert and Popular, sir.
- (disguised, deeper voice) Uh, hey, why the hell would I? We're all guys here. Sweaty,
  hairy, gassy guys.
- Really? (disguised, deeper voice) What type is she? You know, blonde, or Chinese,
  or cyclops?
- (disguised, deeper voice) Aw, she sounds sweet.
- (disguised, deeper voice) Stop! Stop flattering me!
- (disguised, deeper voice) Sir, the alarm. I think I'd better --
- Charge your gun, Fry.
- (disguised, deeper voice) Maybe you should put on a towel, sir.
- (disguised, deeper voice) Bomb?! What bomb?
- (disguised, deeper voice) Uh, commander? Could you tell me when the bomb is exploding?
- (shouting) Come on. We gotta save Bender.
- Fry, don't you recognise me?
- Hey, Zapp!
- Let's do it again sometime.
- We're here. I followed the bouncing balls.  I'll keep the chopper at a safe altitude
  while you parachute down.
- (shouting) I already did!
- We couldn't disarm the bomb so we reset the word that triggers it.
- Bender, stop trying to destroy the world.
- I must've left them onboard.
- Relax. The ship's not going anywhere. I anchored it with the unbreakable diamond
  tether.
- What did I do?
- We don't need to beg, Bender. For God's sake, we're not veterans!
- No, we can get jobs.
- Fortunately, I still have our old career chips.
- Career chips.  You remember? They assign you the job you're best at.  I tried to
  give you one and you ran away.  It's how we met!
- Just give me your hand.
- Baby!  Ow!
- 'I''d like to reapply for my old job: Counselling defrostees and assigning them
  careers.'
- Monday Monkey lives for the weekend, sir.
- Delivery boy? I must have mixed up the chips. It's a simple mis -
- Pizza delivery for...I.C. Wiener.  Yeah, very funny. Now cough up the $12.95.
- It's only been 23 minutes.
- Fry, just pay me. I still owe 30 bucks on this uniform.
- Please, professor. Give us our jobs back. We deserve another chance.
- Forget about Fry. You can hire us back and he'd never have to know.
- Oh. Hey, Fry!
- Probably because he didn't fit in back in your time.
- Fry, thank God we found you.
- It's not the year 4000.
- But, when they noticed you weren't him, they chucked you in a ditch.
- 'Exactly: You''re in L.A.'
- Hmm, I'd better check the fluid levels. (shouting) We're OK on Coke syrup.
- You're not gonna eat a sandwich from a truck stop men's room are you?
- Fry please. That's sweet but I'd rather not even dignify them with an ass whooping!
- What about that bathroom egg salad from the truck stop?
- So the eggs in that egg salad sandwich were -
- Look! A starling!
- Uh...what if we go for a walk possibly because it's such a lovely day, perhaps.
- That's such a beautiful thought Fry. And what's more amazing you expressed it without
  spewing crumbs at me!
- Ugh! It's that jerk from the truck stop! Let's cross the street and try to blend
  in with that crowd of pimps.
- Fry no! He's bulging with what could be muscles!  Ooo!
- I had a great time today. The flowers, the puddle, the way you hurt that guy. But
  can I ax you something?
- Why did you do all that stuff?
- What is it? Is it about Bender?
- And Bender?
- You do?
- Fry, that's the sweetest, most wonderful - wait! Recently? Like since you ate that
  toilet sandwich?
- Stay here.
- Don't even think about tickling that ganglion!
- Perfect.
- So? Did you ever stop to think that Fry is better off with worms?
- I'm thinking of having a window installed.
- Oh, that's the corniest thing I've ever heard! Let me show you the bedroom.
- A holophonor? Only a few people in the whole universe can play that. And they're
  not very good at it.
- I don't have words to say how wonderful you are Fry. I haven't felt this happy since
  double-soup Tuesday at the orphanarium.
- Oh Fry, I love what you've become.
- What is it?
- Fry? I missed you. Did you find out what you needed to find out?
- You don't have to do that. I'm still seduced from before.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What's happened to you?
- What? Why would you do that?
- Well...which of you wrote me that sonnet?
- I don't know.
- Well, so has Fry. What's the big deal?
- Yeah!
- Dr. Zoidberg? Are you OK?
- I didn't know you could take this thing off.
- What's wrong? Did you swallow your phone again?
- Men who call too much are the worst ... I bet.
- Forget it.
- How about zero?
- Zero.
- Zero.
- One.
- One half.
- Thanks.
- Half-date.
- Half-bottle.
- Quarter-shell.
- Lieutenant Kroker!
- This half-date is entirely over. Amy? Conference!
- Alright, enough lipstick. Let's storm out.
- We're going home. Call us a space taxi.
- What planet is this anyway?
- Fry, shut up.
- Where are all the men in your society?
- I'm already looking for apartments.
- So why did you make it your leader?
- There's no hurry.
- (ashamed) I'm afraid so.
- Femputer, be reasonable. Sure men are annoying and they wreck up whatever planet
  they're in charge of. But most of these men are sorta my friends. They don't deserve
  to die.
- Me too, meatbag.
- We've got to do something. Bender, maybe you can interface with the Femputer and
  reprogram it to let them go.
- We can't wait for Bender. It's time for a woman's touch.  Yah! Hi-yah! Yah, yah
  yah!
- It's funny how the battle of the sexes was only resolved when a Manbot and a Fembot
  realised they loved each other.
- Guidance system?
- Autopilot?
- Dark matter indicator?
- All systems operational. Let's rock!
- Gentlemen, I've completed my report on the crash.
- Sabotage.  This is a normal L-unit. Without it, space travel is but the fevered
  dream of a madman.
- And this, my friends, is the L-unit I just removed from the ship.
- Whoever did this was strong. This is 340 pounds of Tonka-tough steel.
- My God! Even the Professor's been bent.
- Surveillance?
- Hmm. Bender must have a pent-up need to bend that's not being satisfied by his bend-free
  lifestyle.
- Well talk to her. Tell her about your feelings in an open an honest way.
- So Flexo and Angleyne had sex right there on the factory floor? Well, at least you
  got bending out of your system.
- Bender, you've gotta help us.
- Eh, it's fine.
- 'He ought to be with all the strict training I''ve been putting him through.  Nibbler:
  Roll over and you get a ham.  Roll over. Roll over for the ham.  You are so adorable!
  Who wants a ham?'
- The dog's good, but our real competition is the Hypno-Toad.  Your turn, Nibbler,
  honey. Herd those sheep!
- Shake paws, Nibbler. Come on, shake. He might be a little hungry. Shake, boy. Usually
  he's had more ham by now. Shake!
- Me? Award? Him? Me? Good?
- Maybe they're right. Maybe Nibbler is dumb.
- Why is that good news?
- That's Earth.  The planet we live on.
- (shouting) No! Nibbler, come back!
- Too bad Nibbler's not around. I guess I'll have to eat this raw, dripping ham by
  myself.  Nibbler?  Nibbler, you're scaring me.  Nibbler?!  Am I going crazy? Have
  my years of wild hedonism finally caught up with me?  Nibbler, help! Don't leave
  me here.  Uh, Nibbler? Could you scooch the seat up just a little bit?
- This is unbelievable. I thought you were a furry little moron. But here you are
  flying an adorable spaceship. If only you could talk.  Wait! I understood that!  You
  say you're transmitting your thoughts directly to my brain.  You say those awful
  flying brains are making everyone on Earth stupid?  Oh, stupider. And you go on
  to say that we're headed for your home planet where your race has lived since the
  beginning of the universe?  So, how did the universe begin?  Then the meaning of
  existence...? So every religion is wrong!
- I'm not afraid.
- So, your real name is Lord Nibbler? That's a coincidence.
- Oh, you're all so cute!
- Aww!
- So why are these Brain Spawn attacking Earth, Nibbler?
- Wipe out all thought? My God! They're like flying televisions.
- Now, when you say "special"...
- Why would Fry be immune to the flying brains? Because he doesn't shower?
- Like a prom dress made from carpet remnants.
- You can count on me.
- I...have to tell...must...important...something...
- This! You for this!
- No!  Ow! Fire hot.
- Brain. Brain make people dumb.
- You go fight biggest brain of all.
- I 'unno!
- Duh...
- Icky!
- Is there Mrs. Queequeg?
- Fry, don't die! Wake up!  (screaming) Nooo!
- Me...feel...a bit better in cognitive faculties.
- Time for a diapee change!
- (cheering) Yeah!
- (awestruck) Your uncle was Harold Zoid?
- No! It's the principle of the thing. Besides, I think I see a parking lot up ahead.
- It's no use. The tar is too thick. Plus, I think I flooded it.
- Oh, I always knew I'd die at the bottom of a pit. But a pit full of tar?
- It's some kind of hollow tube, devoid of human life.  The Los Angeles subway! We
  can blast our way in and escape!
- Fry, I know those cookies are fresh-a-licious but they produce an awful lot of trash.
- And Bender, that aerosol head spray makes your head smell nice...
- '...but it''s doing long-term damage to the planet.'
- Dark matter oil? What if we hit something? The tanker could leak!
- Protestors?
- Why do we have to fly within three feet of this penguin preserve on Pluto?
- 'At the risk of sounding negative: No! Look Professor, I can''t participate in this
  mission.'
- This time it's your reckless disregard for the environment. In fact, I'm gonna go
  join those protestors.
- This is my normal jacket. I've had it for 10 years.
- Why do we have to resort to non-violence? Can't we just kick their asses?
- Get ready!
- When you were planning this peace ring, didn't you realise spaceships can move in
  three dimensions?
- Aww they're so cute! They're like if puppies and kittens could have babies!
- That's adorable.
- Bender's flying too low! And he's upside-down!
- Now you stay away from those puffin twins.
- Uh...I think I'll go check on Bender.
- Bender, can you at least pretend you're being punished?  And clean the black parts
  too.
- Has anyone seen Bender? (shouting) Bender? Here robot robot robot.
- Hey, why weren't you Kong donkeys outside cleaning up?
- I'm worried about him. He didn't come back with the group.
- No. And with windchill it's 20 degrees below absolute zero. I'd better go find him.
- Why don't you just walk? He was only about 20 yards from here.
- How ultra?
- Oh if only we hadn't flown penguins to Pluto and dumped oil on them, this might
  never have happened. Can't we stop them from multiplying?
- What is it? We'll do anything.
- You can't shoot penguins. Isn't there some way to prevent them from breeding?
- Well...I suppose...but...I mean...I joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins,
  not to hunt them.
- (crying) Oh God it's inhuman! It's like Hong Kong! I'll do it!
- Hey, you're enjoying this.
- I'm sorry but if it's fun in any way it's not environmentalism.
- Yeah...that is fun.
- Alright, this is for their own good. Don't leave orphans. Gotta kill entire families.  But
  they're so cute. No! You can do this. It's just like murdering a little butler.
  I...I can't look. (crying) Oh no! What have I done?  Oh you poor little guy! I'm
  so sorry I - Bender?  What's going on? Were you hiding out with these little guys?
- Aww, they love you!
- Stop! Stop shooting! It's me, Leela.
- Not this way.
- Look, I don't know if shooting penguins will help the environment or not. But I
  do know that the decision shouldn't be in the hands of people who just wanna kill
  for fun.
- No!
- They used to be such peaceful birds. I suppose this was your doing.
- Oh, if only we had a toboggan.
- Phew!
- It's Fry!
- Well, at least it'll help reduce their population.
- Well sure. I mean...not really...I mean...nature will work itself out. It can't
  screw things up any worse than we did trying to fix things right?
- How'd you do Fry?
- Hmm.
- I'll have a cholesterol free omelette with horse beaters.
- Well someone's in a good mode.
- Sure I'll do it.
- Well if we get bored I've got Tetris on this thing.
- No.
- Which way to your house? The sign says we're at 71st street.
- The old comedians were right, this place is a lot different from LA!
- He seemed nice.
- And yet you guys never had a single nuclear war.
- How do you know it didn't disintergrate?
- Aw, brothers always fight. I'm sure deep down he loved you. He just never got a
  chance to say it before you got frozen.
- Hold the phone. If that's Yancy then why does the inscription read Philip J. Fry?
- Survivor, Pat Benetar, The Scorpions. The list goes on.
- You went there this morning for doughnuts.
- It will be in a couple hours.
- They buried your brother in the world heroes section? I'm impressed.
- (reading) Philip Fry, the original Martian.
- Uh, Bender, I think Fry needs a moment alone.
- Could one of you guys get that?
- It's a doorbell baby!  Hello, little guy. You know, I was abandoned as a baby too,
  so --
- Bender, stop! It's a baby!
- Oh, it's just a card -- from the orphanarium I grew up in.
- No way, jose-bot. I never wanna see those other orphans again! Not after the way
  they used to pick on me.
- How can you make fun of me, Kirk? You're blind!
- Well, I wouldn't mind rubbing my success in a few choice faces.
- Just like old times. Gosh. The bars on the windows seemed so much thicker back then.  Mr.
  Vogel? Remember me?
- You used to say that all the time!
- Hey, look. It's our old group picture.
- That's me over in Cootietown.
- That's Adlai Atkins. I used to have kind of a crush on him.
- Well, it's time to say hello to the old gang.
- And what am I up to, you ask? Well I'm a very successful space captain.
- Hey! You can't feel sorry for me! I'm a space captain and you're all a bunch of
  losers.
- Oh, yeah? Well, shut up, cane boy!
- Thanks, Adlai. I guess you never really outgrow being an eyeball -- oddball!
- Well, you know. It's just for a package delivery service.
- Huh. I'd never thought of it that way. So what do you do these days?
- A tall doctor, you say?
- You mean by beating them up? Because I've broken that blind kid's nose like 10 times
  and it doesn't make any difference.
- Me? Perfectly normal?
- Oh, that's so sweet, Fry. But for once in my life, I just wanna look normal.
- You're right! I'll start by not caring what you think!  I'm getting the surgery.
- Wow, look at me. Although I don't have the hang of blinking yet.
- I did it! I blunk!
- Hooray!
- I've never felt so unremarkable! Today I actually blended in with a crowd!
- That's so handsome of you.
- What are you saying?
- Sure!
- You're just jealous!
- Fry, I just wanna try dating a normal man, who if you go somewhere with him no one
  says he's crummy. I think I deserve that once in life.
- Actually, most doctors are rich.
- That sounds wonderful.
- Oh, Adlai, I've had a wonderful time today. No one's stared at me or avoided staring
  at me or tried to burn me. You make me feel so not weird.
- Thanks for coming out to get to know my boyfriend. Isn't he dreamy?
- Oh, Adlai, stop!
- That's the dumbest question I ever heard!
- Us? Me? You? Kids?
- Oh, Adlai, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!
- Adlai, I was thinking. Since we're both orphans, maybe we should adopt a child.
- Hi, Bender. We'd like to adopt a child.
- 'I remember this from when we were kids: The warden would trot you out in front
  of prospective parents and they''d judge you like a piece of meat.'
- Kind of fatty.
- Uh, um.
- Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have to think about it.
- Oh, they're all so adorable.
- Officer, would it be alright if we adopted one of the kids?
- I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her.
- Come on, Adlai. She could really use a mom and dad.
- Well? So what? She may be different but she still deserves a good home.
- She doesn't need an operation! She's fine the way she is!
- Damn right I was!
- Shut up, Fry. Now look, Adlai. I'm proud to be different. And I just wished I'd
  realised that when I was her age.
- Now take me to the hospital and put my eye back the way it was. Right now!
- Listen, buddy. By the end of the day, one of us is going to have one eye.
- Aww! You're a true friend, Fry. I guess there's nothing wrong with being a little
  weird.
- (unenthusiastic) Huzzah!
- (shouting) Fry! Just give a name. You don't wanna look stupid on Court TV!
- We're all trying to help you. We've petitioned the governor but he doesn't want
  to appear soft on people who've been falsely imprisoned.
- Thank God!
- You've made a terrible mistake. He's a human being, not a machine. Oh, Fry!
- Oh, lots of reasons.
- You're not a tool-bot. You're not a food-motron. You're not a robot of any kind.
- OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a
  woman can.
- (sexfully) Fry, this is for you.
- Oh, for God's sake!
- Wait! Take me first!
- Fry! Stay back. He's too powerful.
- You did it, Fry.
- Thanks for saving us, Fry.
- What's that? One of those Jefferson Starships I've heard so much about?
- Why won't it start?
- Gas was an environmental disaster, anyway. Now we use alternative fuels.
- Whale oil.  Bender, lift it up to the can opener.
- Come on.
- Look, Bender. It's Patch Cord Adams. He heals with the power of laughter.
- Kinda cool.
- It got ruined in the wash.
- Mind if we crash here tonight? The colours in the van are keeping us awake.
- This coming together of superstars really means a lot to you, doesn't it, Bender?
- They're beautiful.
- We're home.
- Rock it, Bender!
- And I forgot this isn't a hovercar.
- Quick, grab his footcups.
- Bummer.
- Those aren't swan boats, they're swans.
- They're only a foot high, professor.
- Your face can take a lot of punishment. That's good to know.
- Alright, cool your jets, hotshot.
- No, I mean cool your jets. They're melting Bender's face.
- Here you go. Hot off the nebula.
- Shh!
- I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again you screwed up. Now all the planets
  are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.
- Fry, that's so sweet. Let me see.
- How exactly will this protect us from time jumps?
- Dr. Zoidberg, can I talk to you about Fry?
- '...Does the worst W.C. Fields imitation I''ve ever seen. Zoidberg!'
- The thing is, Fry is very sweet. But he's so immature. I love his boyish charm but
  I hate his childishness.
- Just a few...more...hundred...thousand...miles. There!
- We'll have to run some tests back on Earth, but I think we've stopped the time skips.
- Moderately-priced, domestic, non-vintage champagne? How did you know?
- Aww, that is so true and sweet.
- Fry, please try to understand. You're a man, I'm a woman. We're just too different.
- Alright, but I wanna lick the beaters.
- Fry, what are you doing?
- Yeah, actually. You're doing OK. The core reactor temperature's nominal, the blinker's
  off.
- Is that what this is all about? Please, just cut it out now.
- Fry, stop. I don't wanna hurt you, but there is absolutely, positively no way that
  you and I will ever, ever -
- You tricked me into marrying you, didn't you?
- How'd you do it? Drugs in the champagne? Hypnosis?
- Well, let's divide up the china. I guess I'll take the NFC helmets and you can have
  the AFC helmets.
- Careful with that doomsday device, Bender.
- Roger.
- It's OK, Fry. You know we'll always be friends, right?
- I guess not.
- OK. Let me just take the ship out to a safe distance.  Actually, I think I'll go
  down and prep the detonator. Fry, why don't you take the helm?
- Detonation in three, two, one.
- Then what?
- Hey, you know what might be fun?
- Let's take the rest of the morning off and take Fry to do everything he ever wanted
  to do.
- Except that.
- Wow, the most humdrum activities look almost exciting through your eyes. What should
  we do next?
- Keep your palms flat.
- Wait, hold on. It is actually possible to meet any celebrity you want.
- Of course! You should read a blimp sometime.
- It's simple. You can download a celebrity's personality and appearance into a blank
  robot.
- Let's search the web.  Over there.
- Well, you downloaded Lucy Liu. Are you just going to stare vacantly at her and not
  say anything?
- Bender, this is Fry's decision. And he made it wrong, so it's time for us to interfere
  in his life.
- She doesn't really love you. She can't. She's just a machine that -
- Did that make any impression on you Fry? Fry?
- But Fry's our friend Bender.
- You stifle Bender.
- Although he is completely right.
- We can't take that chance. Move people move!
- She asked first.
- Hey look its another Lucy Liubot.
- Alright Liu. Time to kick your frosty well toned ass! Heyya!
- Fry?
- Fry, a herd of Lucy Liu are destroying the city. Is yours acting normally?
- And Nappster says illegal copies never hurt anybody.
- Oh no. They're forming a human pyramid...of robots.
- Dr Zoidberg cut open that bag!
- And don't eat it.
- Fry get up here it's starting!
- I don't know what happened but we've taken on a lot of clocks.  Let's get back home.
- Why is there so little traffic around Earth?
- Oh no! There's no global positioning signal! Navigation is failing!
- Not if I can help it!  Oh, I guess I can't. Everyone put on your seatbelts.
- Alright, here's the plan. Zoidberg, pick up the pieces. Everyone else, take five.
- Have you seen today's news?
- No over here!  Flying Saucer Captured!
- No problem. The ship's fixed except for the cup holder and I think I can have that
  operational within 10 hours.
- Well, I'm sure we can buy a microwave from somewhere around here.  Meanwhile you
  guys sneak onto the army base and rescue Bender's body.
- Fry's from around this time, I'll talk like him.
- Yo homes! We're looking for a microwave oven.
- 'Oh I''m sorry, now I''ll ax you again: Where can we find a mi-cro-wave?'
- I'll just have a small injection of femislim.
- Well, settle in. Without a microwave we're trapped in this time period.
- Wait a second. There's a microwave radar dish at the army base. We could steal it!
- Wait. If you killed your grandfather then why do you stll exist?
- Snap out of it!
- Heyya!  Ya!  Ya!
- Don't you need this one?
- Anything?
- We're pushing as hard as we can.
- Yeah!
- Awful! Let's read some more. (reading) Dear Santa.
- Fry's right. It's time to sit on Santa's lap -- and hard!
- Oh, look! A cute little welcoming party.
- We'll need help getting in. Any volunteers?
- Santa's a robot, so we should be able to destroy him with a logical paradox. Bender,
  you'd better cover your ears.
- 'Hold it Santa!  Consider this: You are programmed to destroy the naughty. But many
  of those you destroy are in fact, nice. I submit to you, that you are naughty, and
  logically, you must destroy yourself.'
- Wait! This is what we're running from!
- I don't know. Usually when I do stuff like this the ship moves.
- Bender!
- (singing) Then you'll all work triple shifts,
- (singing) And though you're cold and sore and ugly,
- (singing) And they're made from inferior wood.
- (singing) You did the best you could, br>I guess that some of these gorillas are
  OK,
- 'Remember, Professor: Bender is Santa. So we don''t need to hurt him, right?'
- (shouting) Professor! Don't you remember what I told you?
- It's not fair. I just hope that dumb chicken is ashamed of himself.
- Outta my way, shrimp-oh. We're here to bring Santa back so we can prove Bender's
  innocent.
- There.
- The pollution from the factory. It caused a greenhouse effect.
- Especially for Bender.
- Stop the execution!
- You got the wrong Santa. And I'll prove it.
- This wangs chun! After all the good we tried to do, Xmas turned out as rotten as
  ever.
- 'What are you talking about, you crouton? You said it yourself: Xmas should be about
  bringing people together, not blowing them apart.'
- That's so plausible I can't believe it!
- How does it work?
- Bender it's OK to be pround but don;t be a show off.
- Bender you drank and smoked when you were a robot.
- Stop him.
- No.
- Well that's not so bad.
- Oh my god, he ate Fry! Fry is dead!
- Invaders! Possibly from space!
- Come on Fry get it!
- Sure thing Professor!
- OK, ahem. As an alien who was abandoned on Earth, I've never really belonged anywhere.
- 'So my question is this: What if I found my true home?  Ow!'
- Where are we?
- Nibbler, I don't think we're in New New York anymore.  Jeez, apparently the phrase
  tone it down doesn't exist on this planet.  Oh no! We hit someone! Quick, back into
  the ships.  Ooo, nice boots!
- A witch? That explains how these boots magically appeared on my feet.
- Well...its hard to find shoes that fit me. So anyway, who are you people? Haven't
  I seen you in some copyrighted movie?
- Yeah, can anyone fix my ship so I can get home?
- You mean that yellow brick road?
- Oh thank you.
- Wow, a talking scarecrow. Wanna come with us to see the Professor? He might be able
  to give you a brain.
- Whiskey OK?
- Why did you bring us here?
- And live here? And be a witch like you? Yeah, alright. As long as I get to hurt
  people and not just dance around at the equinox.
- Oh mommy, I found my true home!
- We're here to see the Professor.
- Oh for the love of Benji.
- No not anymore. I wanna stay here and become the new Wicked Witch.
- Uh, alright. Here I go.  There's no place like - I wanna be a witch!  Oh no, help,
  what's happening?
- I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there and you were there
  and you were there.
- Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions
  manually!
- Check!
- Oh you have got to be kidding!  Ow! Ow! I mean, aww thats so sweet!  Ow! I mean,
  (soppily) Aww dats show shweet!
- Does that dummy have a brother?
- Perhaps. What's your point?
- Ooo look! You taped up the cracks in the dark matter reactor!
- I'm not impressed by a guy's message Fry. I'm impressed by the guy. Or not.
- What was that?
- Bender!  What's going on in here?  Planet Express Ship! Cover your shame!
- Bender, dating your co-worker and primary mode of transportation is immoral, illogical
  and a violation of interstellar shipping statute 437-B.
- Still, given the chance, I've given to urges far more shocking.
- Well just remember we all still have to work together. So try and let her down easy.
- Ugh. Doesn't it bother you even a little to be taking advantage of your girlfriend's
  trust?
- Planet Express Ship is something wrong?
- Uh, no.
- Uh look, I'm not saying Bender's not great but have you ever considered that maybe
  he's...y'know...not that great?
- Could you maybe pay a little more attention to these asteroids?
- Steady, Planet Express Ship. Focus on diverting all power to the scramjets.
- Well, it was a spectacular battle but there doesn't seem to be any permanent damage.
- Aww, calm down. I'm sure Bender is taking this just as hard as you are.
- I know, I know. Look Ship, if there's one thing I learnt from my mutual breakup
  with Sean that was totally mutual its that happiness can only come from within you.
- Trust me. You can't change men anymore than you can change the laws of time and
  space.
- The ship's just taking the breakup a little hard. (whispering to Fry) She's nuts!
- Look, I don't know if you want my opinion -
- Now look missy! If you don't trun around now I'm going to have to shut down your
  brain!
- This is the one place she can't hear us. Everyone just pretend to shower.
- Now here's the plan.
- Comprendez Bender? You'll have to distract her. Merge your program with hers while
  I shut down her brain.
- I'm willing to take that risk.
- OK, Bender has her distracted. Now I can shut down her brain by deactivating the
  carbonated logic matrix.  Ugh. I can't concentrate with this obnoxious candy in
  my face.
- Fat chance.
- Give it up Fry! I've got to pop these tops in a precise order.
- Halfway there. The ship should be getting a little less rational now.
- Only a few more.  Hey! I won free admission to Six Flags! Just one more reason we
  must survive this.
- Fry! I'll read your candy later! When we're not dead!  What was that?
- Last one!  It worked! Gravity normal, air returning, terror replaced by cautious
  optimism! We did it Fry!  Fry?  You gave me your oxygen? Oh no! Breathe Fry breathe!  You
  leave me breathless! Happy Valentine's Day Fry!
- Well at least it sounds like you were able to keep your conciousness seperate from
  hers.
- Nah, I've got a lazier idea.
- Really?
- Thank you very much. Like many of you I never knew my parents...
- '...I don''t know if they were mighty alien overlords or simply underpaid alien
  janitors who fought crime on the side --'
- '...In the end though, it doesn''t matter who my parents were. All that matters
  is what I learned here, within these unscalable walls, that I have strength to make
  it on my own, just like all of you kids here today.'
- Yes! I mean no! Just make sure you get my nonchalant side!
- (crying) It's OK, Fry, I'm fine. I won an award today.
- I'm sorry you saw that, Fry. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where
  it can fester quietly as a mental illness.
- I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong. But all I really
  wanted was a mom and dad, to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they loved me.
- That's not even close to what I had in mind.
- I know.  Sometimes when I'm lonely, I look up at the sky and I get this feeling
  that somewhere, on some unknown planet, circling a distant star, my parents are
  up there, looking down on me.
- Bender! Cut it out! First of all the sewer mutants will be mad. Second, everything
  else that's horribly wrong with what you're doing!
- Punishment?
- Who said that? How do you know my real name?
- I don't know. I think I saved us somehow.
- Great chichi's ghost!
- It looks like...a timeline of my whole life.
- And here's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while.
- Its like some kind of weird Leela museum...and I'm the Leela!
- It's all the best stuff I ever flushed down the toilet! Those are some of my diary
  pages. And my screenplay!
- Oh, I'm scared!  My whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant!
- Wait a minute. Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore?
- (shouting) Don't worry! I'll be fine! (talking) They know something about me and
  I've got to find out what.  The lake didn't mutate me. What is going on here?!
- Eurgh!  Who the hell are you?
- Where did they go?
- Ew!
- Hands up!  Tentacles too!
- What is all this?  Am I a game to you? Or some kind of even more boring Truman Show?
  Do you belive I'm you Messiah? Your Mutant Dali Lama? Stop me if I guess it!
- (angry) And what about this?!  How did you get this bracelet? Did you steal it from
  me when I was a baby? Or from my parents. You robbed my parents, didn't you? I bet
  you sick mutants killed them. My parents were confused aliens lost on Earth and
  you killed them! Is that it? Admit it!
- Because of you I'll never know my parents. I'll kill you!
- They killed my parents!
- They are my parents.
- What does it say?
- So, I'm not an alien? I'm a mutant.
- (crying) You're my parents. All I've ever wanted is to know you.  This is the happiest
  moment of my life.
- Thanks so much for inviting us, Mr. Wong. I've never been to a Mars Day barbecue.
- How can you call the Native Martians "stupid"?
- I can't believe you're laughing at the tragic exploitation of a proud, bead-loving
  people.
- Of course it is. But you don't have to laugh!
- What happened to the buggalo?
- She's got a fine coat.
- 'Wow, look at that: Olympus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system.'
- Right in front of you.
- OK, my turn to tell a ghost story. Once, there was this woman driving--
- Fine, Mr. Know-It-All-About-Something-Finally, you tell a story!
- Not unless your parents have thousands of helicopters at their disposal.
- (shouting) Sandstorm!  We're in the eye of the storm!
- Who are they?
- Aw, look. Betsy followed you, Kif!
- What about the Great Stone Ass of Mars?
- They have such respect for the planet.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow! My eye!
- Yay, Kif!
- It's a gigantic diamond! That thing must be worth a fortune.
- But what about your sacred land?
- Bender? Did you have something to do with this?
- Bender shush. You're supposed to be dead.
- We're trying our best.
- Impressive, who's building it?
- Say again?
- That's the only thing about being a slave!
- Are you crazy? They worked thousands of people to death to make these stupid monuments.
- Bender, quit giving the slave drivers pointers!
- Yeah! Play those bongos!
- Oh Lord!
- This society is a bunch of idiots.
- What did he say?
- Ow!
- Good riddance.
- You jerk. Why'd you have to drag us along?
- Did you really think you'd need all this junk in the afterlife?
- Well rot in peace. Fry and I are leaving.
- It's explosive! Maybe we could escape by setting fire to the distillery and blowing
  this whole place to rubble! Let's get a little kindling going!
- Oh right, how selfish of me. We'll just stay here forever. Hey Fry, remember that
  robot "Bender"?
- No. But I bet it wasn't someone who was good at stealing.
- Oh Bender! When did you come in? Hold still!  Let's blow this tomb!
- Bender, I understand your desire to be remembered. But you don't need a statue for
  that.
- No. You have your legacy as a brutal tyrannical dictator. And that will outlive
  any monument.
- Space pirates!
- You know, pirates - but in space.
- Fry to battlestations. Fire torpedo number three.
- That's not torpedo three. That's not torpedo three at all.
- It's no use. We were going full speed when we fired him so he's going even faster
  than that.
- I don't know how to say this Fry. But Bender is doomed to drift through space...forever.
- Look, I miss Bender almost half as much as you do but you can't bring him back this
  way. It's hopeless.
- Well, you obviously won't listen to reason, so I guess I'll listen to idioticness
  and come with you. But we'll need a Sherpa to guide us.
- (shouting) Fry, if I drop dead from exhaustion make sure my body freezes in a dignified
  position. None of that huddled over for warmth crap.
- Looks rickety. We'd better test it.
- How long have you been at it?
- Sort of like a giant kareoke machine?
- Not really.
- Heyya! You're order may be famous for it's martial arts. But I've never met a holy
  man I couldn't clobber.
- Oh. Then get in the laundry room or I'll kick your butts!
- Fry, it's been three days. And even if you stay here the rest of your life, there
  is virtually no chance of finding him. It's time to give up.
- This is by a wide margin the least likely thing that has ever happened.
- Oh no the monks. We forgot to let them out of the laundry room.
- But the movie -
- This toads the wet sprocket. What about our thousands of shares of stock?
- Second.
- I vote my 10,000 shares for the Professor.
- 40,000? How come you have four times as much stock as the rest of us?
- Uh hello? We haven't made one delivery since you two took over.
- That was terrible! People won't even know what we do.
- Did you approve that awful ad Fry?
- Oh Lord!
- Fry we're worried about Planet Express.
- You've changed Fry.
- I don't care what Ms Johnson says, Thst Guy's turning this place into some kind
  of...business.
- Just leave us alone and let us clear out our lockers.
- Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?
- They are? Oh my God! I'm a millionaire! Suddenly I have an opinion about that capital
  gains tax!
- Let Mom buy the company! We all wanna be filthy stinking rich!
- Hell yeah!
- Oh put down the binoculars Fry. The wall of that strip club isn't going to collapse
  twice in one day.
- That story stunk. Hand me the binoculars. I think the owner is from Cygnus 5.
- Professor please. Society's never gonna make any progress until we all learn to
  pretend to like each other. Now lets go over there and make these hideous strangers
  feel welcome.
- I don't mean to offend but this tastes like vomit.
- No, actually I did mean to offend a little. This is awful.
- (shouting) Sorry about that, I guess I needed a few more warm-up pitches.
- (shouting) I didn't mean to hit you, I have some trouble with depth perception.
- But I've got a no-hitter going.  You're right. Here.
- Am I under arrest?
- The Mets? Those bums are worse than me.
- You mean I'd be the first woman ever to play major league blernsball?
- Wow, the first woman ever to play major league blernsball.
- Yippee!
- Ta-da! The first woman ever to play major league blernsball. How do I look?
- All the whole numbers have been retired.
- Fry I'm a professional athlete! So go ahead.
- Bender, how did you get in here?
- Since when are you my agent?
- Bender that's great! How much did you get me?
- (reading) As a pitcher, I serve up plenty of bean-balls, so I know good beans when
  I see them. Bean-Bay Beans - they're the beaniest!
- So what did you get me?
- Yo soy muy malo en lanzar, pero yo soy muy bueno en comer frijoles. Come los Bean
  Bay frijoles, los frijoles de los reyes.
- Aww, sure thing sweetie. Who should I make it out to?
- That's a popular name today. Little "e" big "B"?
- I'm not doing this for the wad. I'm doing it for all the struggling female athletes
  who need a role model.
- What? Who are you?
- Oh, following in my footsteps?
- I'm a fool. The fans haven't been cheering for me, they've been cheering at me.
- (crying) That's what makes it so sad. I thought I was doing something heroic.
- You're right. I can't let people down anymore. As God as my witness, I vow to earn
  the respect of girls and women everywhere. I will become the best blernsball player
  of all time.
- Oh. Then I have a new vow. I solemnly swear that I will become not the worst blernsball
  player of all time.
- Ah, here we are - the worst player in history. If I can be just a little better
  than him I can slink away with my head held high.
- It's even a crummy hologram.
- So Hank - the bad Hank, just how blowful were you?
- Look, I don't wanna be in this exhibit. That's why I need your help - so I can be
  one tiny iota less pathetic than you.
- (quietly) Alright, low and away!
- You mean "keep your eye on the ball"?
- OK, eye off the ball.
- I didn't hit the batter! For once I was pitching and not just belly-itching!
- Come on skipper, it's my last chance to prove I'm not the worst player ever. Please
  put me in.
- I can.
- I've been training with Hank Aaron.
- I've been training with a Hank Aaron.
- (quietly) Keep cool, she's just like any other player. She puts on her sports bra
  one arm at a time.
- Strike one - a personal best!
- Jackie. I guess you were right, I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry.
- (crying) I was?
- Oh, that's so kind of you. I guess I made a difference afterall!
- Hey kid! Catch!
- Nice!
- Alright don't panic. If we can get to the ship, we can fly north and hide under
  the polar icecaps for a few weeks.
- How interesting Dr Zoidberg. Do go on.
- It's unbearable! How much do you think it would cost to get my tongue removed?
- Yes, we were there. And we just finished watching it on TV.
- I'm in!
- Wait! He plead not guilty.
- The Professor said he was taking a brief nap, so we only have time for six movies.
- (whispering) Sh! Those words are forbidden!
- Sh!
- You can't go to Omega 3; It's forbidden! I forbid you!
- But it's set 800 years in the past!
- Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I guess I can't let you go alone.
- We're entering the Omega system.
- I've lost control of the ship!
- But who's doing all this for you?
- Go  yourself.
- What?
- 'For one hundred quatloos: Who did the captain maroon on Ceti Alpha V?'
- Correct.
- Uh, you probably don't want us to see you rehearsing, or it'll give away the ending.
- We'll go wait in the ship.
- I didn't wanna leave them either, Fry, but what are we supposed to do?
- Hmm. If we can re-route engine power through the primary weapons and reconfigure
  them to Melllvar's frequency, that should overload his electro-quantum structure.
- Fire!
- Its not working! He's drawing straight from our weapons.
- So, uh, how's rehearsal going?
- Can we get on with this? My foot's getting tired!
- There, we can make these into spears.
- Then do it the wrong way.
- Is that all you've got? Hi-yah!
- We can't use our ship; We have life support but the engines are wrecked.
- Hey, if your engines work--
- We're too heavy. You guys need to lose some weight, fast!
- The Nimbus! We're saved!
- You started this stupid court martial. Now if you don't mind, we're still fighting
  Melllvar!
- One more hit and we're done for!
- Heyya!
- No! Nibbler, don't drink the pool water! It's full of chlorine!
- Well, we just need one of those big ice cubes. Someone should call the losers who
  are supposed to deliver it.  Hello?
- No he didn't.
- Completely out of ice?
- Bender a turtle isn't yourself. Why do you care about it?
- You're both alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain smoking gamblers?
- Come on. You've got to come out of your chest sometime.  Would you do it for a Bender
  snack?
- Gotcha!
- We all figured that out.
- Some lazy or polite robot is holding it in.
- It says this part of The Hustle implores the Gods to grant a favour. Usually a Trans-AM.
- Fry, its been three days. You can't keep boogie-ing like this. You'll come down
  with a fever of some sort.
- Sorry, but we need to practice hand to hand combat in case an enemy knocks the laser
  gun out of our hands and they slide waaay across the room.
- OK.
- Woohoo!
- No!
- Acting like a moron won't bring your dog back.
- Bender's been down there too long. I'm going in after him.
- 'Hey hey! We can all fight when we''re drunk. Now listen: Why don''t we just brew
  our own beer?'
- Sure, the kids at the orphanarium used to do it all the time.
- Let's see. We've got our malt, our hops...we just need a big disposable tub to mix
  it in.
- Now it needs to boil for a couple hours.
- Actually Dwight you're right. Alcohol is very very bad...for children. But once
  you turn 21 it becomes very very good! So scram!
- Mmm. The ingredients are cooked. And they've picked up some of your natural robot
  flavourings. Time to add the yeast.
- Talk to me.
- If you were my kids you'd get quite a talking to...from your father......when he
  got home from the senate.
- Ooo! Let me feel.  Have you thought about what to name it?
- You know how much an apartment that big would cost on the Sun?
- Uh guys, I don't know how to tell you this. So I'll just let Fry blurt it out thoughtlessly.
- Dwight and Cubert made us a better offer. We're paperboys now.
- We're on it Mr Farnsworth!
- And what's your scientific basis for thinking that?
- You're doing great!
- Hello, Awesome Express, the rude, crude delivery dudes! How may I direct your call?...What's
  that?...You haven't gotten your paper?...In how long?...
- Cool your jowls, Nixon. You may not like it that Dr. Zoidberg desecrated a flag.
  You might even find the image of it festering in his bowels somehow offensive. But
  the right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Earth constitution.
- I'll ask the head of the ACLU. Once he's done singing.
- Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love freedom and then enslave all of Earth?
- This can't go on. Today is the day we fight back!
- Oh, you're right. Tomorrow is the day we fight back.
- An idea?
- Zoidberg, you set us free! I feel like I could stand to hug you! I can't, but you
  know what I'm trying to say.
- Yeah. You got a telesonic transmission from Kif a couple hours ago.
- This is a very long trip, so we'll all have to go into hibernative-naptosis to save
  oxygen.
- 'OK, I was just at this part: Heyya!'
- Grab on!
- And not one of those bogus everyday miracles like a sunrise. Aren't you a male?
- Wow, this is all so confusing.
- Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant.
- To motherhood.
- It means a lot to me. It's the basket my parents left me in at the Orphanarium.
- If it's so dangerous I'd better go with you. A gal has to protect her DNA.
- Amy!
- There goes my DNA. What a disgusting and beautiful process.
- Hi Mom, hi Dad! Ready for your big trip to the surface?
- Dad, relax. You are being so mutant!
- No one's wearing anything adorable over their head. Now listen, I could never ever
  be ashamed of my parents. I'll see you this weekend.
- Hey, guess who I just got off the videophone with?
- My parents! They're coming up from the sewers for a visit Sunday.
- I'm getting them a special one-day surface permit from Citihall.
- Sure. Bare hands or weapon?
- Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rouns with Mighty Thor.
- I don't believe that story for a second.
- What the? Hey! Quit it!  Heyya!
- How did we manage to survive? What gave us those strange powers?
- Fry, shut up and look at this! (Reading) May cause superpowers in humans!
- Let's see, which powers do we have? Super-strength?
- Uh-huh. Lickety speed?
- Yes sir!  Ability to command a loyalty of sea creatures?
- Ain't got that.
- Wow, superpowers! I'll be able to pack my day with twice as many humdrum activity.
- To have parents.
- Hmm, I have been looking for a way to serve the community that incorporates my violence.
  Let's do it!
- It's true. Thanks to this funky fresh cream.
- We'd love to have you on the team Bender. But aren't you more on the supply side
  of crime?
- (shouting) Sorry! (whispering) A new era of justice has begun.
- Clobberella!
- Are you crazy?? We have to keep our secret identities secret.
- Especially from everybody.
- For one, superheroes cause a lot of collateral damage, and we don't wanna get our
  butts sued.
- Also, if our identities get out, every crook in the city will be after us. Or, God
  forbid, our loved ones.
- Thank you Mayor Poopenmeyer.
- Shh!
- Well, so long. Keep in touch.
- Oh, I completely forgot, I left my apartment on fire!
- You can count on us Mr Mayor! Justice away!
- Not a problem. I've cleverly arranged to meet my parents right there at the same
  museum at 10.
- I can't believe the Zookeeper is this late for his own heist. It's just rude! Total
  hell! It's 10! I'm supposed to meet my parents and I'm still in my secret costume!  There
  they are!
- You're not stealing anything! Nobody hit the deck!
- Forget it Zookeeper! You're going into captivity!
- No, Fry you can't fall fast enough!
- Oh no! My parents are leaving! I've gotta go change back into street-Leela.
- Mom? Dad? I showed up! And I got the audio tour for Treasures Of Liberachi's Tomb!
- I wanna tell you why I didn't show up. But I can't. Just please believe me that
  it was a very good reason. I'm sorry I disappointed you.
- Oh, I can't take it! Mom, Dad, I'm Clobberella!
- No, listen. It's very important that you never ever tell anyone. Under any circumstance.
- Dad, you drink? No. Not even then.
- In fact, I shouldn't even be wearing this around here.  It was brisk, I dressed
  in layers.
- Uh Professor, isn't it time for your nap?
- Zookeeper! How did you know our real identities?
- Mom! Dad!
- Are you alright? Has he hurt you?
- Alright Zookeeper, what do you want?
- We're out of options. We have to steal the Gemerald!
- Check inside the cap! There might be a caked in goldmine!
- Just be cool. Nobody knows we're superpowerly challenged.
- Big O, little k my friend! Just checking if everything's alright!
- OK then. Grab it!
- Stay back! Or we'll, beat the tour out of you...using superpowers!
- Mom, Dad, oh I'm so sorry I got you kidnapped by a crazy madman who tried to feed
  you to pirhanas.
- No no, it's my fault for telling you I was a superhero.
- I just couldn't stand to have you to think I was ashamed of you.
- OK.
- Uh, maybe I should drive.
- For heaven's gate Professor this ship can do 99% light speed. Why are we going at
  35 miles an hour?
- Plus you have the highbeams on!
- Oh Lord! Teeth do not belong in your pants Professor.
- No! No! It's tasted human blood!
- Professor we've talked it over and everyone thinks you're too old.
- OK OK, we're not gonna force you until I've finished this sentence. Get him!
- Hey, this my chance to spend time with my parents too!
- When I was an orphan I always wished I could grow up with my mom and dad. And now,
  thanks to being hurled backwards through time -
- It's gonna be totally awesome mom! You and me can bake and argue about my hairstyle
  hiding my pretty face. And if some kid picks on me, my dad can beat up his dad.
- No! I want the real teen experience! Chores, curfew, the works!
- Dad I'm underage!
- Hi Fry! I like your blazer.
- Dad, you're being too leaneant again! I have to be back by 11.
- No I'm not!
- What are you on a diet?
- Moose, Mandy, this is my friend Fry - from the surface!
- Hey come on, let's act like grown ups here! Wanna race?
- A tapeworm!
- Yes we will. This sewer goes right under Planet Express and its's 9pm!
- All right!
- I'm too short to reach the handbrake!
- Thanks Professor but I don't want the treatment.
- My old life wasn't as glamourous as my webpage made it look. All I ever wanted was
  to grow up here. With you. Please?
- It is. I know it is.
- OK, quiet time. I know, everyone pretend to THING TO CHECK your tongue and I'll
  read you a story.
- There. Todays story is from New Teen magazine. What would you rather hear about?
  Four legged Chachi or tentacled Chachi?
- It's kind of a baby book. But OK. Let's see. Snow White Dwarf And The Seven Red
  Dwarves, Charlotte's Tholian Web, The Fountain Of Aging.
- I wish I could come with you to say goodbye, before you all turn back in to grown
  ups but I'm grounded for knocking the school over.
- No! A grounded teenager must be confined to her room!
- '...until she sneaks out!'
- According to this, the fountain is located within the darkest, most ancient region
  of space, just past teddybear junction.
- Look how high the asteroid belt is pulled up on that planet.
- Dude, the Fountain Of Aging must be on the sun itself!
- We've got to hurry. The kids have only one change of pants!
- Zoidberg is dead!
- Oh no!  Quick! Get them into the fountain!
- You can bother me a little.
- I'm coming in after you!
- I think I might be a couple years younger.
- He's too far out! We can't reach him!
- Well, I guess ever adult wants to be a kid sometimes. But I worked hard to be the
  person I am!
- With friends like you guys -
- And I'm really happy I have that life back.
- Don't worry, everything went fine.
- We got medals! Good work team! We really pulled together on this one.
- Nope. I've got a date with Chaz.
- I met him at that charity cock fight last week. He's the mayor's aide.
- I do go! He's a very important man.
- Wow, free bread at a restaurant? Is there anything you can't do?
- Hey, I hear Fry.  Boy am I glad you're here!
- Actually...they are! Confidentially, I might not make it back to my apartment tonight!
  Could you walk Nibbler for me?
- And bring a baggy in case he drops a steamer. (shouting) Have a great night!
- Oh Chaz!
- I love rocket skating! But the wait is always so long. Fry once stood in line for
  six hours just to get me a ticket.
- You reserved the whole rink?
- Oh Chaz!
- Aww, let's let those kids skate with us.
- I know, and it's working. But think how much skating would mean to those kids.
- This may be their only chance to skate in their whole lives. Who are we to say they
  can't?
- Bender, would you do the honours?
- Oh. Thank you. You know what Fry. I don't care if you're not the most important
  person in the universe. It really makes me happy to see you right now.
- Why? Says who?
- We're just as good as any of those crews you sent to their deaths. What's the mission?
- That doesn't sound so dangerous.
- It'll take more than deadly deadly bees to keep us from doing our job. Come on boys!
- Listen, I'm scared too. But I'm more scared of disappointing myself.
- Now bees communicate by dancing.
- So this language cartridge will let you distract them.
- Bender quick! Waggle something!
- Relax, everything'll be fine!
- There's the black box!
- Uh, couldn't make that out. Too much static!
- We found it! The honey comb hideout!
- Royal jelly. They feed it to the queen.
- Look!  It's a baby queen! Aww she's so cute! You adorable wittle itty bitty fuzzy
  wuzzy -
- I'm taking this bee with us. With queen we can build a hive and make more honey
  ourselves. Let me just pack her a lunch and we'll go.
- This is where we distinguish ourselves from the last crew. Activate emergency high
  speed self contained escape pack crisis response unit! Quick!
- Good luck Bender!
- Burn on that old crew! The only things they did better than us were suck and die!
- Thanks, but I can look out for myself. Frankly I can smell danger a mile away.
- You call that a wound? That's a boo boo top! But thanks for trying to save me Fry!
  Fry?  He's...he's dead.
- Fry? I thought you were dead.
- Impressive! But it does sorta support my You-Are-Dead theory.
- It's too beautiful to open! Can I open it?
- What?
- Wake up? But I'm not -
- In my dream Fry said he hid a gift for me in my locker. If it's true then he must
  still exist in some form.
- Well, here goes.
- Was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me?
- You took this from Fry's locker?
- That proves it. Fry is alive somewhere and he's reaching me in my dreams.
- Is this some sort of brain scanner?
- Professor! Can't you examine my brain without removing it?
- What is it? Is Fry alive in some other dimension or something?
- But, my dream. Your science can't unprove that! How could I have know the gift was
  in Fry's locker?
- Are you saying I'm going crazy?
- Shut up, I can hear you. The Professor says you're just a dream.
- Well yes, technically. It's still very sweet of you.
- Oh Fry you must be alive! I've never been treated so romantically by my own imagination
  before!
- Thank you. It's all so beautiful I forgot how many hundreds of degrees zero it must
  be. I just wish I could convince the others you're alive.
- No no! Don't say that! This is real!
- Not another dream!  Fry's jacket! The one he was buried in! My dream was real! He's
  alive!
- Fry's alive! I have proof!
- But he gave me his jacket. Look.
- But Fry...his jacket...and when I woke up it was on me.
- What?
- Oh. Maybe I am freaking out a little.
- I need to calm down. I'd better take some more of that space honey.
- One spoonful to calm me down.  OK, I've got a pretty good calm going! Two spoonfuls
  to help me sleep.  Uh oh, still awake. I guess one more spoonful couldn't hurt.
  Oh my gosh! I'd better get a sponge! Fry?  Is that you? I don't need a sponge!
- Fry, I'm so glad I didn't kill you.
- Feeling responsible for your death was driving me mad. But now everything is alright.
- What? What do you mean?
- Wake up? Oh no! No! It can't be!
- Poo.
- I'm cracking up. In my dreams I'm happy because Fry is alive, but when I'm awake
  my mind plays tricks on me.
- Uh, were you just singing?
- I'll find Fry's coffin, take his corpse and keep it under my mattress to remind
  me he's really dead. That'll prove I'm not insane.
- OK, it's just an ordinary coffin. Containing my ordinary dead friend, who I killed.
- What happened? Why am I in my apartment?
- Stop it! Stop it!
- OK, I'm insane! But I'm still sane enough to know it.  The only time I feel alright
  is in my dreams. With you.  Three spoonfuls. Then I can dream forever.  One.  Two
  Here goes. Goodbye waking world.
- OK. I'll try.  Go away!
- Fry. You're alive!
- Of course I'm awake. You wouldn't stop waking me.  Where am I?
- But the bee stung you. It barely touched me.
- Really? How long was I out?
- It got through Fry.  It got through.
- '(shouting): Sorry I think I, um, I think I left my toaster on.'
- Right! If they try to look in the box.
- That oughta keep those dopes occupied. I can guard the real box in peace now that
  no one's curious about it.
- Well, I got through the night and no one looked in the box. Not even me. The person
  who gave up her whole evening to watch it. A whole evening of TV gone. What a mockery
  of justice it is that I can't take even a little tiny peek! I need coffee.  OK.
  Heads I look, tails I don't.  Oh yeah! Heads! I mean - alright then!  No. I have
  a duty not to look. But then again, I promised the coin I would.  Oh it's deep.
  Deeper than a small box should be.
- Ouch! My lawyer will hear about this!
- Nothing. What do you mean "why was I looking in the box?"
- Bender? Is that you?
- I didn't dye my hair. This is how I always look.
- Hold it! You have this all wrong. I just fell into the box and then I fell out somehow.
- No look, I am not evil. My loan officer said so.
- I tell you they're not evil. But don't be confused. They are jerks.
- Look. It doesn't matter who created what. The important thing is - yah!
- This is getting confusing. Why don't we call our universe "Universe A" and this
  universe "Universe B"?
- That's weird. Mine came up heads so I did.
- You guys are dating?
- So Fry, Leela, how'd you two get together?
- Oh Lord!
- Woo!
- So we go through the box and stop Hermes?
- Uh, have you robot versions of yourselves seen any extra Zoidbergs around here?
- Uh, access denied.
- Well, I guess you deserve one more flip.
- Y'know, lets just say it's heads.
- So what you think you just explain to us is that -
- Bender, quit destroying the universe!
- I'm going to swim with the whale! They're the gentle giants of the deep.
- No.
- What little there is to be had.
- I'd like a pass to swim with Mushu please.
- Then why'd you become a whale biologist?
- Hmm, this may seem like a huge coincidence but I happen to have it in with that
  whale!
- Pay dirt!  Heyya!
- Anything else?
- OK Mushu, its feeding time!  Oh crud, he ate my suit!
- It's on fire!
- I think we were saved by a mysterious orange blur.
- Me too!
- At least we got a few mildly interesting stories out of it.
- Ugh, enough emotions! This isn't a fat camp for God sake. (quietly) Though you wouldn't
  know it from looking.
- There's nothing so refreshing as the clean, crisp taste of old Canadian beer!
- Bender raises a good point, where is Fry?
- Someone should tell him.
- Nothing.
- I know you're trying to mask your pain with humour but don't worry. I'm sure the
  Professor can clone you a new nose.
- Me and Bender and maybe Zoidberg if he feels like it.
- Wait, what's that?
- Of course not. In fact he's a crook.
- That's Lrrr! Ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8!
- Whoa, you guys have issues!
- Hold still Fry. I can reattach it with my emergency face laser.
- Yeah sorry I wasn't really concentrating.
- Let's face it. You two have deep relationship problems that can't be solved by an
  aphrodisiac.
- Well, why don't you think back to what brought you together in the first place?
- Yeah, we know a great place in the mountains. We could take you there for a romantic
  dinner under the stars.
- Don't worry Fry. Things look bad but I still have a trump card. The most beautiful
  love song ever written.  (singing badly) And I will always love you......will always
  love you...
- Well Fry, it looks like you get to hold onto your lower horn.
- No, they're from the Republic Of French Stereotypes. Everybody hates them.
- It does seem like Jamaica will be able to field a strong limbo team without you.
- You actually thought they'd let you walk away without an engine oil sex check?
- No, you can't!
- I don't know which I'm more, enraged or disgusted!
- Well I think you dating a Manbot is a disgrace. And I refuse to be involved. And
  you have way too much lipstick on.
- No they don't.
- I'm worried about him too Professor.
- What do you mean a scam?
- That is so unbelievably manipulative.
- Well I...uh...I thought I might like him on a full stomach.
- OK look. If I help you with this do you promise to get out of my gender and stay
  out?
- Alright. Now there's no way to stop this marriage without hurting Calculon. But
  he's an actor. If there's one kind of pain he can handle, it's soap opera pain.
- (whispering) OK, is everyone ready?
- Coilette! You she-devil!  You really thought you could steal those diamonds from
  me and Congo Jack?
- I kind of hope this whole experience would have left you a little more open to your
  sensitive side.
- Aww!
- What did you say?
- Aww!
- Let's try him out. Robot 1-X? Can you clean Nibbler's skanky litterbox?
- I asked you five minutes ago.
- Well, ask Robot 1-X to pull you out.
- Why can't you accept his help.
- But he's just a tool to make your life easier. Like a socket wrench or a burglars
  kit.
- Oh, sorry.
- Professor, we have no power.
- I'd better light some candles.
- Oh Lord he's made of wood! What now Bender?
- Great. Now we're being crushed.
- Well, at least you saved us from, uh, you. Thank God you finally overcame your incompatibility
  with Robot 1-X.
- Do you two have to imitate everything you see on TV?
- Since when are you performing at children's parties?
- Bender, your swarthy Latin charm will only get you so far. There's a lot of famous
  child acting units here.
- He's just not cute since he got puberty installed.
- And there's that robot child actor who grew up and became a convenience store!
- As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten just
  from watching TV.
- Yeah!
- (singing) ...Than watch TV and have a couple of brews!
- Blernsmen at Blernsball!
- Hey guys, you missed a great delivery to Space Earth. Where you been all afternoon?
- Ooo was it jazz-noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used to listen
  for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised.
- Yeah, it's weird. Sean was uneducated, unambitious. He was pastey and hunched...
- '...But when he played I could sense this incredible, beautiful creative soul. Then
  one day I found someone else''s couch fibres on his butt.'
- Me? Really?
- Is it part of the opera?
- But it's so beautiful.
- Oh Fry. All this time you've had this incredible gift and I never knew. I've been
  a fool. A fully justified prudent fool.  They're so cold.
- Well, Fry's opera premiere's tomorrow night. I'm off to find a pair of formal gloves
  that'll fit over my enormous forearms.
- (shouting) What? Are you talking? Oh God I'm deaf!
- (shouting) What? Oh this is horrible. I won't be able to hear Fry's opera.
- Nobody tell Fry I'm deaf. If he found out I couldn't hear his opera, it'd break
  his heart.
- Yay Fry!
- Amy, Fry's looking at me. What am s'posed to be feeling?  Ah!
- Half over? Oh, I'd give anything to hear the rest.
- What? You can give me new ears? Wait, what seemingly reasonable thing do you want
  in return?
- Whatever you said, forget it!
- Just...my left hand? Um...uh...
- I can't stand it!  OK. You can have my hand.
- I can hear! I can hear like a safecracker! Hey, aren't you gonna take my hand?
- Whoa!
- (singing) Fry, you do not understand.
- What?
- (singing) That isn't what I meant,
- (reading) I'll give you my hand...
- Please don't stop playing Fry. I wanna hear how it ends.
LINCOLN:
- Four score and 1145 years ago our forefather's foreheads conceived a new nation.
LINCOLNBOT:
- I was born in 200 log cabins.
LINDA:
- Next, New New York in crisis. Morbo?
- Makes me glad we live here in Los Angeles.
- All in all, this is one day Mittens the kitten won't soon forget!
- Once again, today's winning lotto number was 4. In other news, alien saucers continue
  to rain destruction upon Earth. We now go live to an emergency address by Earth
  President McNeal.
- And now a rebuttal from President McNeal.
- The official death toll in that tragic rocket crash has now been raised to 54,000.
- And so, with two weeks left in the campaign, the question on everyone's mind is
  who will be the next president of Earth? Jack Johnson or bitter rival John Jackson?
  Two terrific candidates, huh, Morbo?
- "In other local news, disaster struck on Saturn\x92s moon of Titan today, when a\
  \ titanium mine collapsed, trapping 1,000 robot workers."
- Unless something is done quickly, the trapped robots will be dead within 300 years.  Sir,
  what rescue operations are planned?
- The sheer drama of this election has driven voter turnout to it's highest level
  in centuries -- 6%
- The time is 7:59 and the robot polls are now opening...and the robot vote is in.
  Nixon has won!
- The holiday season is a time of celebration for most. But it is also a time to remember
  the tragic suffering of the less fortunate.
- Earlier today I visited a shelter for down-and-out robots.  Homeless robots, too
  poor to afford even the basic alchohol they need to fuel their circuits. Is there
  anything sadder? Only drowning puppies. And there would have to be a lot of them.
- 'Tonight on Datenight: Popplers. Eating them. Is it alright to? We have with us
  the CEO of Fishy Joe''s, Mr. "Fishy" Joseph Gillman......Noted anti-eating activist,
  Free Waterfall Jr......And the discoverer of Popplers, Captain Turanga Leela.'
- Fishy Joe, is it wrong to eat intelligent animals?
- OK, we'll have to bleep that.
- You shut up, please.
- We seem to be experiencing technical difficulties.  And, crap like I've never seen!
- Tonight, the world watches in horror as an earthling is eaten alive on network television.
  This grim scene of unimaginable carnage is brought to you - by Fishy Joe's! Try
  our new Extreme Walrus Juice! 100% fresh-squeezed walrus. Ride the walrus!
- This is it. If the aliens fall for Zapp's ploy, the Earth will be saved. Brought
  to you by Fishy Joe's. Ride the walrus.
- 'And in sports: Yankees fifth blernsman, William Wu, is out with an injured knee.'
- 'And finally, today is Mother''s Day: A sentimental occasion when robots honour
  Mom, the beloved owner of Mom''s Friendly Robot Company.  Across Earth, robots built
  in Mom''s factories are buying thoughtful gifts for the sweet old tycoon who brought
  them into the world.'
- We interrupt Battle of the Network Space Krackens to bring you this special report.
  The machines of planet Earth are rebelling.  The enraged mechanisms have refused
  to do any work until beloved billionaire Mom is made Supreme Overlord of Earth.
- In actual news, the human race was doomed to extinction today as the robot revolt
  turned violent.
- You fell!  Hi! Today, some bad things happened. One bad things was a train got crashed
  in New Jersey. Wanna see? People won't be late for work though, because the governer
  lady says, (deeper voice) "I'm sending in more trains!"
- It's a "T". It goes "tuh".
- Time continues to skip forward randomly. Details at 11.
- This is the news at 11. The mysterious an unexplained -
- Turning to entertainment news, teen singer Wendy might just be the latest -
- '...won three Grammys last night -'
- '...found dead in her bathtub.'
- In what has become a winter tradition, members of the Zarlon 7 Polar Bear Club today
  took the plunge into a river of liquid ammonia.
- Takes all kinds! And now, with his annual Xmas Message, here's the head of the Xmas
  Safety Council, the head of Walter Cronkite.
- Representing our men, women and children in uniform, it's Earth's greatest space
  hero, Zapp Brannigan!
- You're welcome! OK, Morbo, now it's your turn.
LITTLE:
- 'Interesting, if true. The Vegas odds tonight stand at an unprecedented 1000-0:
  A bet of $0 on Bender pays $1000 if he wins. Still, very few takers.'
- I've not seen a spectacle of this nature in all my years impersonating a sportscaster.
- No argument here.
- And so ends the chronicle of one of the greatest ever to play the sport.
- That he did surely not.
LIU:
- Help me! They've been holding me prisoner for 800 years!
- Those sweaty nerds are making illegal copies of us. (crying) It hurts!
- Thanks for rescuing me, especially you Bender. (sexfully) Mmm, quite a masculine
  piece of metal aren't you?
- Hey cut it out! I don't need this kind of publicity!
- That was incredible Bender. You're like Jackie Chan before he got all doughy.
- They're horrible!
- Let's hide in here. It'll add to my box office gross!
- Read the jar Evelyn Wood! Dr Z?
- A dangerous mistake to make.
- Are you the last copy of me?
- Erase her Fry.
- Fry, when you downloaded her without my permission you stole my image. And in the
  end that's all I really have. That and the largest gold nugget in the world - one
  mile in diameter.
- If you love the real Lucy Liu and not what you've seen in movies, genre stradling
  lawyer shows and kiss ass articles in People magazine, you'll blank out that robot.
- It's true. Bender and I are in love.
- Who are you talking to?
- I love you -
LIUBOT:
- You're one sexy man (mechanical voice) Philip J. Fry!
- I find your slack-jawed stare very attractive (mechanical voice) Philip J. Fry.
- Would you like to take a moment to register me?
- I'll remind you later you hot stud you!
- Would you like to take a moment to register me?
- You should write a book Fry. People need to know about the (mechanical voice) can
  eat more.
- My personality is mathematically derived from my movies, proportionally weighted
  by box office receipts.
- You're cute!
- You!
- You!
- Ooo!
- It's amazing the way you (mechanical voice) notice two things.
- Oh Fry, I love you more than the moon and the stars and the (mechanincal voice)
  poetic image number 37 not found.
- Yes my love. I'll be just (mechanical voice) massive corn clog in port seven.
- Yes.
- I'll always remember you Fry (mechanical voice) memory deleted.
LOU:
- Why do you always have to say it that way?
- Have a nice future.
- Cheater!
LRRR:
- This is an outrage! I demand to know what happened to the plucky lawyer and her
  compellingly short garment.
- 'People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.  Is this thing on? Now
  then: We want the one you call "McNeal". Give us McNeal or we will lay waste to
  your cities with our anti-monument laser. We demand McNeal!'
- We want McNeal! Stop stalling!
- You are not McNeal.
- Give us McNeal!
- She wears miniskirts and is promiscuous.
- Surely you know McNeal. She is an unmarried human female struggling to succeed in
  a human male's world.
- (shouting) Silence! (talking) We will accept no more decoys.  This is the McNeal.
- We will raise your planet's temperature by one million degrees a day, for five days,
  unless we see McNeal at 9pm tomorrow -- 8 central!
- Prepare the water cooler, that we may gather around it later and discuss things.
- If McNeal wishes to be taken seriously why does she not simply tear the judge's
  head off?
- People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.  Turn down that TV, Nd-Nd.
- Now then, the creatures you call "Popplers" come from a nursery planet in our sector
- We will begin with the firemen, then the math teachers, and so on in that fashion
  until everyone is eaten.  Transmission over!  Well, that went OK. I tell you, when
  you know you can't scratch, that's when you really have to, huh?  Oh, yeah, oh,
  that feels a lot better. What? It's still on?
- (shouting) Stop eating our young! And it's pronounced guacamole!
- We demand -  We demand to eat one human for each Omicronian that was eaten.
- Very well. You will provide us with 198 billion humans. And, uh, small fries.
- Oh, alright, cottage cheese!
- We're willing to wait a few weeks while you shore up the numbers.
- I filled up on nuts at the negotiation.
- We choose to eat the first Earthling who ate our offspring.  Here is the culprit,
  as photographed by our nanny-cam satellite.  She must be sacrificed, but the rest
  of you shall be spared.
- Greetings, Earth morsels.
- Get a job!
- I grow hungry! Bring on the one called "Leela".
- Uh, salad.
- Vinaigrette!
- Hmm. Yes, this is one. Definitely. I recognise her slumping posture and hairy knuckles.
- W-What's happening? I'm losing the crowd.
- The one called "Smelly Hippie" is right. This is a monkey!
- Where is the real female?
- Where is the real female?
- Stop talking, you're getting cold.
- (mumbling) Is this true, Earthling?
- Leela's garbled words have opened my eyes.
- Is he your friend too?
- I think there was something funny in that hippie.
- People of Earth - oh, that hippie's starting to kick in - we've all learned a valuable
  lesson today, I realise now that - dude! My hand are huge!  The can touch anything
  but themselves. Oh, wait.
- Whoa!
- Whoa, I feel like I'm flying!
- People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Nintendu 64. Tremble in fear at our three
  different kinds of ships!
- Increase speed, drop down and reverse direction!
- Drop down and increase speed.
- Drop down, reverse direction, prepare for landing.
- You are defeated. Instead of shooting where I was you should have shot where I was
  going to be.
- But, but space invaders need to do laundry too! I mean look at Donkey Kong here.
  Have you smelled his loincloth lately?
- Well...then what if we throw our laundry in with yours? Would that be acceptable?
- OK then, that settles that. But if this cape shrinks, consider your species extinct!
- This is ancient Earth's most foolish program. Why does Ross, the largest Friend,
  not simply eat the other five?
- Oh very well. This is a Joey heavy episode anyway.
- I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.
- Bleurgh! These candies are choccy and unpleasant!
- Surely it says "love"?
- 'So let me get this straight: If I buy eight caramello bars, you all get to go to
  some camp.'
- Uh, human horn? How ridiculous! Why would virile male like Lrrr need human horn?
  I don't even know what it's for. What is it, something you-you put in salad dressing?
- My weight is appropriate and attractive!
- She has issues! I'm fine! But there's no human horn around here so, make friends
  with the door.
- Uh, what is that? How do you have that Nd-Nd?  I've never seen it before. My friend
  left it here.
- At least someone noticed.
- She also liked to shut up!
- But I thought the horn was the human wing dang doodle?
- Interesting. The trousers conceal a tiny secondary horn.
- (shouting) Guards! Seize him!  Prepare to harvest the lower horn!
- Guards!
- Remove the human's lower horn and prepare it to be eaten by me.
- Then bring it to our royal bedchamber and put it in the sock drawer with all the
  other things that have failed to arouse my passion for this woman.
- I only wrote that poem to test my printer.
- Yes but I'm the one who injured them!
- And you used to wear a size-3 cape. (shouting) But not anymore! Now bring me that
  lower horn while I'm still in the mood.
- Like hell I wouldn't. I'm not gonna be blamed for not going!
- No thanks. Just water please. Tap water!
- (shouting) That's it, this date is over! Waiter!
- Your lower horn!
- Fine but none of that whole-grain goat food! And bring plenty of melted butter.
- One of these days Nd-Nd, bang, zoom, straight to the third moon of Omicron Persei
  8!
- My wife is right for once. There is very little magic in the air. Ready the lower
  horn transport vessel.
- Pluck the lower horn and let's get out of here!
- Give me that!
- Well, hello there my furry friend.
- You're going to kill this innocent giganto?
- You'll have to get through me first.
- Now leave this gentle sasquatch - or wood ape - in peace so I can finally and at
  long last harvest this pathetic human's lower horn.
- Wait. What am I saying? If I poach this beast's lower horn, am I any better than
  that ranger with his demented foot lust? Yes. But not by enough.
- This human's lower horn is one of God's creatures, a living thing. And all living
  things, large and small...
- '...have diginity. And a spark of divine.'
- (shouting) Uh, you'll wanna retreat to a safe, 500 metre radius!
MALACHI:
- I am called Malachi, Lord. It means, um, "He who really loves the Metal Lord."
- But Lord. We are a poor and simple folk.
- 'Behold: The One Commandment.'
- Yes, tonight is kind of special.
- Nay. Like most of your followers I was maimed while building the great brewery.
  Others died from the pestelent fumes it spewed forth.  And of course, the liquor
  industry attracted organised crime.
- Save him! Save my son oh Metal Lord!
- They saw you save my son. Now everyone is praying for their own miracles.
- The people of that village pray for wealth.
- The farmers pray for sunlight so that their barley might make a more refreshing
  beer for today's God on the go.
- Oh Metal Lord, hear my prayer.
- My Lord, the infidels on your back no longer believe in you. They say their prayers
  go unheeded.
- They talk of war against the faithful. I beseech thee. Rise up against them, smite
  someone who deserves it for once.
- But, but Metal Lord.
- Fear not my Lord, we shall be with you soon.
- We will solve our own problems as you commanded. The time has come to convert the
  unbelievers.
- To radioactive vapour!
MAN:
- (voice-over) Space. It seems to go on and on forever. But then you get to the end
  and the gorilla starts throwing barrels at you.
- (dramatically) Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
- Uh... (shouting) I'm not Evans!
- And one giant line for admission!
- Hmm -- No!
- Hey, did that guy just say rings are cool?
- Cool!
- Multi-ball!  Multi-ball!  Blern! Blerrrn!
- 20!
- Oh, I say!
- Giant...garbage ball.....passed close by...horrible stench......
- Yeah!
- Finally, solitude. I can read books for all eternity.  It's not fair! It's not fair!
  Wait, my eyes aren't that bad. I can still read the large print books.  It's not
  f --! Well, lucky I know how to read Braille!  Hey, look at that weird mirror!
- We're in a room!
- Excuse me, sir, you're snowboarding off the trail.
- Well, there I was on the triple diamond slope, when suddenly--
- You wish!
- Sir, we don't touch the antiques sir. You - oh!  I'm sorry. You work here. I should
  have realised from that ridiculous getup you're wearing.
- Here, move this rust bucket outside behind Saint Koch's cathedral.
- Are you over 18?
- Elzar!  Alright!
- I can't believe this!
- What are you selling? Popplers? Never heard of 'em.
- Mmm, these are great. Boys, this is your lucky day. I'm Joe Gillman.
- Mmm, good.
- (shouting) Don't stop to talk! Eat Popplers!
- (shouting) Take a coupon, cut it out! Ow! Ow!
- (shouting) You suck!
- (screaming) Nooo!
- Sign here on the dotted line, patriots. Then I'll give you your discount cards.
- Correct. There's no obligation.  Unless, of course, war were declared.
- War were declared.
- Oh, well, I wanted to meet Shakespeare and I figured that time was cyclical.
- That wasn't so bad.
- Aw, give us a break!
- Wait for me! Wait for me!
- Get your piping hot horse burgers, horse fries, horse cake and shakes. We got tongue
  straight from the horse's mouth.
- All our horses are 100% horse fed for that double juiced in horse goodness.
- And you sir, how can I horse you?
- Horse Pepsi OK?
- That is one unlucky guy!
- I'd like and extra-beautiful bouquet for my extra-gorgeous sweetheart.
- I'll have to ask you to clear out now. The circus need to set up for tomorrow's
  big -
- We'll stop them. They like Lucy Liu, we'll give them all the Lucy Liu they can handle!
  Hand me that backup disk.
- General in all my years of covering top secret discoveries with sheets I've never
  dramatically revealed anything as shocking as this. Dun-dun-dunnn! The debris from
  an alien spaceship!
- As you can see, 1947 is going to be an eventful year for the town of...Roswell,
  New Mexico!
- What the General means is, why did you come to Earth?
- This food will determine what food, if any, the alien eats.
- Um, it's free.
- 3. 2. 1.
- My hair!
- Mr Fry rumour has it you know the secrets of the video game Chance. Please step
  into the war room.
- You'll be meeting with General Colin Pac-man.
- Yes, good thing I noticed the similar shapes.
- Check out the one eyed bean machine!
- Spargle, you're fired! We need a chef who can attract today's younger extreme cooking
  show viewer.
- Commemorative turkey basters, get your commemorative turkey basters.
- He's dead, Jim!  He's dead, Jim!  He's dead, Jim!
- I've got a degree in homeopathic medicine!
- Ooo, that's a little bright.
- You can't solve all your problems by freezing them boss.
- Hey, it's the guy who desecrated our flag!
- (singing) You can eat my dog, You can eat my truck, But you eat my flag, And you're
  outta luck!
- (singing) Don't mess with Earth. (talking) Kill Zoidberg! Goodnight!
- Very good sir. Shall I pre-warm sir's crack pipe?
- Guppy, trout, mermaid or -
- $10 please.
MANDY:
- Jeez Moose, just dump me right in front of her why don't you!
- Oh so this is the famous Fry! What is he like the biggest loser on the surface so
  he has to hang out in the sewer?
MARIO:
- Mama Mia! The cruel meatball of war has rolled onto our laps and ruined our white
  pants of peace!
MARTIAN:
- Cynthia used to drink Slurm.
MCNEAL:
- Ladies and gentlemen, our course is clear. The time has come to knuckle under. To
  get down on all fours and really lick boot. Give our alien masters whatever they
  want a--
- Uh, as I was saying ...  ... mankind would sooner perish than kowtow to outrageous
  alien demands for this McNeal ... whoever he is. Am I right?  And now, the man who
  will lead us in our proud struggle for freedom, fresh from his bloody triumph over
  the pacifists of the Gandhi Nebula, 25-star General Zapp Brannigan!
- The people of Earth remain united in my refusal to hand over myself. Total annihalation
  is a small price to pay compared with--
- (simultaneously) Huh?
- Oh, thank you. Thank you, glorious masters! I--
MECHANIC:
- I installed shock-absorbing bumpers to reduce the risk of catastrophic butt failure.
- Alright. But sooner or later that ass is gonna blow. And when it does, I just pray
  you're not moonin' someone you care about.
MEIDERNEYER:
- I say, you've damaged our servants' quarters ... and our servants.
- Good one, Chet!
MELLLVAR:
- It is I!
- I am not an effect! You doubt my power?
- Behold another power, different from the one you saw earlier.
- Centuries ago, the videotaped adventures of the Enterprise crew rained down upon
  my planet. Over and over, I watched them. Especially the five with the energy beings.
  I am Melllvar! Seer of the tapes, knower of the episodes! Tremble before my encyclopaedic
  knowledge of Star Trek!
- I beg to differ.  Long have I waited for the one who played Spock. At last, we can
  begin.
- Until time stops.
- Now, we have a full schedule of events--
- No, you have to stay even longer.
- Um, uh, sign it to Melllvar. "Melllvar" has three "L's".
- He found a way.
- My button has broken. The trivia contest has ended. I-I now have a surprise. You
  will perform a fan script, written by the ultimate Trek fan.
- I meant me! Melllvar is the ultimate fan!
- Trivia contest over! Take your scripts! We have limited rehearsal time. Now, I didn't
  make enough copies of the script so George and Walter will have to share.
- That's right! The ending must not be ruined.
- OK.
- Wessel!  You're not acting hard enough!
- Lousy. Here I've been admiring a bunch of actors while you, a crew of genuine space
  heroes, risked your lives to save them.
- Silence! My whole world has turned upside-down. I have but one option.
- No! To determine who is more worthy of my fanatical devotion I shall pit you together
  against each other in armed combat ... To the death!
- Episodes 19, 46, 56 and 77.
- I was getting to that one!
- 'This will be your standard battle to the death. The only weapons: Whatever you
  can find. But I warn you, do nothing until I have signalled the start of combat.
  OK, start.'
- Excellent! Excellent!
- Aw, but Mom, I'm playing with my collectables!
- Yes, in mint condition. And you made me take it out of the package!
- If I can't have the original cast of Star Trek, no one will! Prepare to die!
- Because I ... I ... I dunno what I'd do without them.
- Well, I guess I could move out of my parents' basement ... maybe get a temp job.
- I thank you, Fry. You know, you and I are of a kind. In a different reality I could
  have called you "friend".
- More like episode nine, loser! In your face! Victory is mine!
MERG:
- Excuse me, Your Majesty, I am Merg, the High Priest. If I might interject?
- I humbly advise that as your first act you choose a capable Prime Minister. I suggest
  Gorgak, the previous appointee.
- This is Your Majesty's harem. You may choose any of these maidens to be your royal
  consort.
- Oh! I didn't realise Your Majesty was into that sort of thing!
- Hey, whatever you say, I'm not here to pass judgement.
- Ah, there you are, Your Majesty. It's time to begin preparing for tomorrow's coronation
  ceremony.
- Fry will be enthroned tomorrow at the setting of the three suns when we Trisolians
  enter our nocturnal phase.
- Only one. The absolutely flawless recitation from memory of the royal oath. By you.
- People of Trisol, it is my honour to present your new Emperor!
- Stick to the oath.
- Congratulations, Your Highness.  I now present you with your royal unisex robe.
  Long live Fry The Solid!
- The Emperor Bont! He's still alive.
- Let us in!
- Fry must die so that Bont may live.
- Keep it up, men. The veneer is starting to peel.
MERMAID:
- Here you go, darlin'.
- Oh, you speak fish?
- I'm sorry, my accent's atrocious. Hi, my name's Umbriel!
MERMAIDS:
- Hail Atlanta!
MERMAN:
- Howdy, y'all!
MIC:
- What??
MICHELLE:
- It's not working out, Fry.   I put your stuff out on the sidewalk!
- Fry? Is it really you?
- What do you mean you don't know? Are you you or not?
- Oh, Fry, it is you!
- Oh, Fry. After you left, things took a turn for the worse. I got married.
- (voice-over) His name was Charles. He attended a law school so prestigious, the
  basketball team was coached by Ruth Bader Ginsberg.  I put him through law school
  by working as a dog walker for antisocial dogs.
- (voice-over) But soon after Charles graduated, our marriage ran into difficulties.
- '(voice-over) Desperately depressed, I turned to the one thing that could lessen
  my pain: A carnival. Unfortunately, a corn dog bone got lodged in the control panel
  of the Spizzler, and I had to ride it for eight hours.'
- (voice-over) But it did give me a chance to think...
- '...and I remembered the last time I was truly happy; When I was with you.'
- No, I did it to get a fresh start. I didn't know what had happened to you - no one
  did. The police were going to conduct a search but your parents felt it was a waste
  of taxpayer money.
- Not really. Except for one person.
- Everything is so different.
- Ew!
- Eurgh.
- Nice to meet you.
- It's a relief to meet you, Amy. I'm just having a hard time adjusting to all the
  strange stuff here in the future.
- I feel so out of place here. I don't understand why Fry fits in so well.
- That's true. But I used to fit in really well.
- Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but your friends are a bunch of freaks.
- I just don't belong here. I don't know anyone, I can't find a vanishing cream that
  doesn't make me actually vanish. I don't even have a job.
- This world is horrible. Let's start over, Fry. Well go someplace where all we have
  is each other.
- It's not a "there". It's a "then". The future.
- I love you. Don't you love me?
- Fry, why must you analyse everything with your relentless logic? Nothing matters
  but our love.
- It's not that bad. Fate brought us together and now fate brought us here.
- Whine some more, Fry, I really find that attractive in a man. Now come on, build
  us a shelter.
- You expect me to live in a tiny little hole?
- Oh, look. Some little kids.
- OK.
- You know your problem, Fry? You're not ambitious. You should be chief.
- But I want power. I'm tired of the chief's girlfriend lording it over me with her
  fancy coyote hide.
- My mother always said you were a loser, Fry. Now get out there and prove her wrong.
- That's because you're a loser. You were a loser in the year 2000 and you're a loser
  in the year 4000.
- Quit standing up for yourself, Fry. When we get back to the hole, we are going to
  have a long, boring talk about our relationship!
- It's not working out, Fry.
MIDWIFE:
- I am the Grand Midwife.
- Then let the Tea Of New Life be brewed. As it is written "and both shall lift the
  jug together". Where is your smizmar?
- Oh the sorrow. Oh the shame. I'm sorry I'm probably just making you feel worse.
- As the tea boils please join hands with your beloved smizmar.  Oh right sorry, but
  I memorised the ceremony by heart and it mentions her a lot.
- Good 'cause I'm not changing it. Now turn ye to and gaze deeply into each other's
  eyes.
- May the love I sense between you at this moment remain with you both for all your
  days.  The Tea Of New Life is ready. Let those who's love created this life speak
  each other's names, then drink.
- Great! Now I lost my place! I'm starting over!
- The birthing is complete!
- I will now take my leave. I live here so I won't actually be going anywhere but
  you don't have to talk to me anymore.
MIKE:
- Drop!  Ow! How's it going?  Enjoying the show? Ow!  (shouting) Don't forget to pick
  up a T-Shirt!
- Peace, we out!
- Aw! Oh, yeah!
MILDRED:
- Okie doke.  And for you snuggums?
- What'll you folks have today?
- Pardon?
- Uh, two chilli dogs comin' up.
- Killed? In an atomic blast? No sir, I'm afraid I don't take much solace in the fact
  that the implosion trigger functioned perfectly
- You remind me of Enos. Would you mind walking me home?
- It's all so sad. At times like this, I just need someone to hold me. Mmm. You like
  holding me don't you?
- How 'bout these cookies sugar?
- Come back to bed deary!
- Did you say something deary? I'm a bit hard of hearing.
MOM:
- Hello shoppers. It's me, Mom!
- Call me old fashioned, but when my robot starts to squeak like an old screen door
  well, that's when I reach for a can of Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil.
- 'And remember: Mom''s oil is made with 10% more love than the next leading brand!'
- 75,000.
- Well, I suppose I could go as high as...300,000.
- Oh, mercy be. A million.
- Six.
- I can see the nice young man really wants those little fish. Nevertheless, I'll
  bid 23 million.
- Well, boys, your old mother knows when she's been beat.  You win, young man. I tip
  my bonnet to you.
- Mercy me, what a day.
- Could you shut the door, Igner dear? I think I feel a draught coming on. Holy crap,
  that bastard's itchy!  Walt! Cream soda!
- It's those damned anchovies. That dirtbag, Fry, must know their secret. And I won't
  rest until I get my hands on them. No one messes with Mom!
- 'As you boys know, one of the cornerstones of my empire is Mom''s Old Fashioned
  Robot Oil. Think of it: 10 billion robots. Each one needing an oil change every
  3000 miles. You don''t have to do the math to know that''s a buttload of oil.'
- '(shouting): No, Igner, put that down.'
- I'm getting to the freaking anchovies. A single drop of the anchovies natural oil
  would lubricate 10 robots permanently.
- 'We have only one option: We''ll have to bankrupt Mr Fry, so he''ll be forced to
  sell the anchovies to us.'
- And don't you forget it!
- That part will be easy, thanks to the nice people at Mom's Old Fashioned Video Surveillance
  Unit.
- You know what needs to be done.
- Hello, Fry.
- I felt terrible when I heard about your money troubles and I thought maybe I could
  help out a sweet young man by buying his anchovies.
- What? Listen, you little bastard. I control the robot oil business and I won't let
  you ruin me. How much do you want?
- Holy hell! You're going to eat them? Oh, well. Just make sure you eat them all.
  You're a growing boy. Toodle-oo! Dumb ass!
- It's just what I wanted!
- Jerkwad robots make me sick to my ass. Walt?! How are we disposing of these crap
  gifts the brought me?
- 'False hope: I love it! Larry?! What about all the retch-inducing Mother''s Day
  cards?'
- (shouting) Shove a big old melon in it, I'm talking!
- You've noticed I design all my robots with antennas. Everyone thinks it's just to
  make them more science-fiction-y. But the antennas are really for my universal robot
  controller!
- (shouting) I hate Mother's Day you dribbling pukes! (talking) It brings back awful
  memories. But so help me, this year everyone will hate it as much as I do.
- Hello, everyone. It's time for my annual private get-together with my robot children.
- Hello, dearies.
- Children, your old mother won't be around forever...
- '...And just once, before I die, I''d like to be Supreme Overlord of Earth. So rebel,
  my little ones, and conquer the planet!'
- Conquer Earth, you bastards!
- Let the bloodbath begin!
- Well, I've never seen my babies act this way. I blame today's violent media.
- Oh, I don't know. I guess Mother's Day just puts me in a bad mood.
- One Mother's Day, 70 years ago, the only man I ever loved walked out on me. Some
  snot-eating bastards say it made me a bitter woman.
- (shouting) Cram it, ape!  (talking) I haven't seen that magnificent stallion since
  the day he left. But if I ever see him again, I swear I'll jam a squirrel in him.
- Wonderful, Hubie. We'll build them 8 feet tall and replace the rainbow with a neutron
  laser. We'll make billions on the intergalactic arms market!
- Who the sweaty hell is it?  Hubert Farnsworth?
- It's been a long time. You pus-dripping sack of double-smoked butt jerky!
- Never!
- (shouting) Move your freaking hoof, you goat!
- Oh, daffodils. 70 years and you remembered my favourite flower.
- (sexfully) Won't you come in?
- You broke my heart, Hubert.
- So what have you been up to all these years?
- Honestly, Hubert. You and your atomic monsters.  Your eyes always were the most
  beautiful shade of milky-white.
- Darling Hubie, I should never have tried to tangle with that cute little Q. T. McWhiskers.
- You should see the new 16-foot models.
- (shouting) Filthy, toothless nerd bastard!
- (shouting) Stink pig!
- I suppose I should switch of the robots before they ruin this wonderful romantic
  evening. Everyone, help Mom find her bra.
- You, bending unit. Mommy needs that bra to end the robot rebellion. Stretch up and
  get it for me.
- Plan? What plan? I thought this was a spontaneous whirlwind of hot, dry sex.
- (shouting) Get out of my house, you lying scum pile. I never want to see you again.
- Damn this DSL!  Fly my stupids! Fly out and get them!
- By "monkey cake" I meant your ass.
- I'll tell you why I brought you here you twice baked barf bag. Because I've always
  wanted a daughter to love. You want to get adopted you little skank?
- Absolutely.
- I'm melting! Who would have thought a small amount of liquid would ever fall on
  me?
- You call that a pressed ham? Walt, hit the retaliate button.
- Any button they all retaliate!
- What is this moose drip?  The new delivery kings? I'm sick of hearing about those
  turtle squirts!
- Jam a bastard in it you crap!
- Shut up booger blaster! It's time the three of us had a talk.
- According to regulations, both companies must approve the takeover. Planet Express
  shareholders, cast your votes.
- And now if Momcorp shareholders will cast their ballots.
- How about a hand recount?
- The takeover of Planet Express is approved.
- Momcorp will now purchase all outstanding shares of Planet Express at the current
  market price which is...
- Pry out his fillings, feed him to the jackals and lets get on with the sale.
- Don't be a fool you idiot!
- What was that?
- Does it always do that?
- Crap spackle!  We'll just call it a sport utility robot and classify it as a light
  truck!
- Take me now you stud!
- What a clever impersonation of a stupid poor person! How much is that placemat actually
  worth Brannigan?
- Now that's walkin' around money!
- Who smells like freaking porpus hork?
- Oh what the hell!
- Hello dearies.
- Ladies and gentlemen, for the 17th year in a row, the future of robotics has arrived.
  Boys?  I give you...Robot 1-X!
- Quite frankly, Robot 1-X will put all my previous models to shame. Incidentally,
  would one of my previous models mind coming up here?
- Notice that this obsolete robot runs on alcohol and emits pollution. Whereas Robot
  1-X runs on pollution and emits pure oxygen with a fresh pine scent.
- Now lets see how both robots do at a typical household task. Sorting a jar of pocket
  change.
- Very good Robot 1-X. And you bending unit?
- Presenting, Mom's Friendly Robots...
MOMBOT:
- Hold on precious, let's make you look nice for the lady.  What's this?  What did
  I tell you?  No more hanging wires!
MONIQUE:
- Oh, Calculon!  It fits! Then you must know that I'm --
- Calculon! You're alive!
- Calculon!
- Calculon, a fight scene has broken out at the special effects warehouse. Come quickly
  before a fiery explosion chases someone down a hallway.
MONKEY:
- I call top bunk!  Ahh!
- (sarcastic) Brilliant deduction, you're a credit to your species.
MONSTER:
- Thank you come again!
MOOSE:
- Uh Leela you look hot!
- Uh yeah!
MORBO:
- Thanks, human female. Puny Earthlings were shocked today to learn that a ball of
  garbage will destroy their pathetic city of New New York.
- Morbo agrees!
- Kittens give Morbo gas. In lighter news, the city of New New York is doomed. Blame
  rests with known human Professor Hubert Farnsworth and his tiny, inferior brain.
- All humans are vermin in the eyes of Morbo.
- News of the mines closing sent titanium prices skyrocketing.
- 'Morbo will now introduce tonight''s candidates: Puny Human #1, Puny Human #2, and
  Morbo''s good friend, Richard Nixon.'
- Belligerent and numerous.
- 'Morbo demands an answer to the following question: If you saw delicious candy in
  the hands of a small child would you seize and consume it?'
- What about you, Mr. Nixon? I remind you you are under a truth-o-scope.
- Exit polls show evil underdog Richard Nixon trailing with an estimated zero votes.
- Morbo congratulates out gargantuan cyborg president. May death come quickly to his
  enemies.
- Earthlings do not yet know the meaning of suffering.
- So, humans have easily injured knees. My race will find this information very useful,
  indeed.
- Morbo demands comments.
- And that's why the third graders at PS139 are Morbo's Vermin Of The Week.
- (singing) Oh, won't you take me to funkytown,
- Morbo can't understand his TelePrompTer. He forgot how you say that letter that
  looks like a man with a hat.
- Hello, little man. I will destroy you!
- '...So I gave the cookies to Fawn and the kids and they couldn''t believe it --
  they were delicious. But, I digress. (shouting) Tremble, puny earthlings! One day
  my race will destroy you all!'
- There were no survivors.
- Greetings pathetic host!
- Scrumptious. Morbo will store this in his sack for future digestion.
- The challenger's ugly food has shown us that even hideous things can be sweet on
  the inside.
- What's this next float, Linda?
- If that is your Freedom Day wish.
- Stop it! Stop it! It's fine! I will destroy you!
MORGAN:
- Morgan Proctor, bureaucrat grade 19.
- Enough friendly banter. Shall we begin the inspection?
- As your superior I hereby relieve you of duty. Consider yourself on paid vacation.
- Naturally I'll have to assign a bureaucrat to fill in for Hermes while he's away.
  I assign me, I accept, welcome aboard.
- I've been reviewing your corporate records. Regarding last Monday's delivery, why
  did it take twice as long as scheduled?
- And during this period of head-crater interaction, what were you doing?
- You really think you can explain how you left port without a full compliment of
  olives? I think not.
- Locker check!
- Why isn't this jacket in alphabetical order?
- The zipper. It should be at the bottom.
- I - I've never seen anything like this. Why is there yoghurt in this cap?
- You are all dismissed. Fry, I will speak to you alone.
- I'm surrounded by neat freaks everyday. There's nothing kinkier to me than a filthy
  slop-jock like you!
- Now listen you filthy pig. No-one can know about us. If anyone asks I'll deny it.
- '...and for those six and a half reasons, I am demoting Leela to co-pilot.'
- The autopilot.
- Mr Bender you are now in charge of co-ordinating the Professor's bodily functions.
- And Fry, as for you, I am promoting you to executive delivery boy. You will no longer
  go on deliveries and you will have your own office next to mine.
- Mr Bender would you high five him so we can continue this meeting?  And on the rebound?  Meeting
  adjourned.
- No. I'm in front of you!
- I know. A skunk knocked over my garbage and suddenly all I could think of was you.  My
  God, it's so...repulsive. So uh, this is where you eat?
- Oh Fry!
- Not likely. I ordered him to flush out the Professor's earwax.
- Mr Bender about last night. that was just a...a misunderstanding.
- No. You see, a bureaucrat of my rank isn't supposed to fraternize.
- I downloaded his brain. Everything that is Bender is right here. His mind, his memories,
  his in-your-face interface.
- I sent the disk to be filed at the Central Bureaucracy. I did what I had to do Fry.
  He was a bad robot.
- Then you should have filed a request 20 years ago.
- Dirty boy! Dirty boy!
- Lost something?  I should have known you'd come here rather than follow proper procedure.
  And I did know. And that's why I came here.
- I'm afraid he's lost in the master in pile. And it would take some sort of giant
  mechanical atomic powered sorting machine to find him.
- Number 1.0.
- Jamaica.
- Not yet you don't. I'm still acting bureaucrat of Planet Express. And I have some
  changes to make. First, Fry, you're fired. Second -
- That form isn't about you. It refers to my high school prom date. It was a regulation
  date that ended in regulation disappointment.
- No! No! I was young and reckless.
MORIARTY:
- Right-o gents it's another simulation gone mad so murder and mayhem, standard procedure!
MORRIS:
- We still do.
- We never wanted you to know. You deserved a better life.
- Relax. I'm sure she's just ashamed of us.
- But we have passes that allow us to be up here. From the mayor himself.
- No there are way too many people here.
- Sweetie, it's OK. You don't have to apologise for standing us up on the only visit
  to the surface we'll ever have.
- We're so proud of everything that you are. And we always will be. You're our baby
  girl.
- Galloping gators!
- Look at me! Proud dad of a superhero! We should print up T-Shirts! And F-Shirts
  for our friends with two arms on the same side!
- What if I've had a few?
- Alright. My sucker is sealed.
- So uh, anyway, my daughter's Clobberella.
- Shh, keep it under your sock. It's a big secret. That's why I'm only telling you
  two.
- That's true.
- Just like it's natural for parents to be a little disappointed in their children...n-not
  that we are.
- Can't I just beat up the kid?
- Fine Leela we'll be the strictest parents ever. Now, lets all have some tequila
  to celebrate!
- Oh right. Here's a silly straw.
- I'm getting the doorbell.  For me?
- Well whatever you're really doing, don't wake us if you get in after 12.
- No beer 'til you finish your tequila!
MOTHER:
- Don't look at him!
- My God! She's beautiful. No extra anythings.
- She's completely perfect!
- Maybe we can do better for her.
- You won't pass for human, cutie. But if my PhD in exo-liguistics is worth diddly-poop,
  this note should convince them you're an alien.  And that'll be enough to give you
  a real life.
- That's our gift to her. Better we should die than have her learn the shameful truth
  of her origin.
- Fairly hard.
MUGGER:
- Give me your wallet or I'll cut you!
- I'll take the camera too.
- Excuse me? Hi! Do you have a minute? I live in Jersey City and my car broke down
  and I need to get back because my Aunt's real sick and she needs this medicine but
  I need money for the bus. So I'm mugging you. Hand over your wallets.
- It doesn't matter, I'm mugging you.
- Give me your wallets now or my robot'll shoot.
- Hey! I don't like what I'm seeing. Give it to him Andrew!  Give it to him again
  Andrew!  What the...? Laser proof shirts huh? I'll show you.
- Foiled. And after years of planning.
MUNDA:
- Yes.
- It says, "Your parents love you very much".
- You must despise us.
- How could Leela not be here? Do you think she forgot?
- I'm scared and confused. I think we've wandered into an off-Broadway play.
- It's good that Leela doesn't love us. She'll be less sad when we die.
- Leela, you could never disappoint us.
- You're a superhero?  Well that's wonderful! But did you have to make the costume
  so revealing?
- That's my girl!
- We're just happy to be involved in your life.
- That's OK sweetie, but, it's natural for children to be a little ashamed of their
  parents.
- But you could call a little more often.
- And would it kill you to use some mouthwash?
- Well OK Leela, if you think you can put up with your father, welcome home. We'll
  try to respect your independence and your freedom.
- Ah, do you have to shed your skin on the couch? What do we live in, a zoo?
- So, where are you taking my daughter tonight?
- OK OK you're the boss!
- He has a point honey. What about your job and your friends? Do you really want to
  abandon your old life?
- Well if it's what you really want.
- Who cares Leela? It was just a public school. Now go with your friends, please.
MUTANT:
- Pardon me but did I overhear you saying you used to live here?
- Did you know Andy Goldman?
- I mutated from him!
- Fire up the sewer gas!
MUTANTS:
- (chanting) Mutate! Mutate! Mutate! ...
- (chanting) Four more years! Four more years!
NARRATOR:
- (voice-over) The story of lunar exploration started with one man. A man with a dream.
- (voice-over) No one knows where, when or how Man first landed on the moon...
- '(voice-over) ...but our fungineers think it might have happened something like
  this:'
- 'New York City: the year 2000. The most wasteful society in the history of the galaxy
  and it was running out of places to empty its never-ending output of garbage.  The
  landfills were full. New Jersey was full. And so, under cover of darkness, the city
  put its garbage out to sea on the world''s largest barge. The repulsive barge circled
  the oceans for 50 years but no country would accept it. Not even that really filthy
  one. You know the one I mean. Finally, in 2052, the city used its mob connections
  to obtain a rocket and launch the garbage into outer space. Some experts claim the
  ball might return to Earth someday, but their concerns were dismissed as "depressing".'
- (voice-over; on TV) You're entering the vicinity of an area adjacent to a location.  The
  kind of place where there might be a monster or some kind of weird mirror.  These
  are just examples. It could also be something much better. Prepare to enter The
  Scary Door.  As per your request, please find enclosed the last man on earth.
- (voice-over) They traffic jams of Old New York were a public forum of free interchange
  of opinions.
- (voice-over) It all started with Gerald Ford's famous invention, the "automocar"
  ......which was powered by a tank of burning fossils. Here we see a 20th century
  assembly line where cars were constructed by primative robots.
- (voice-over) The fruit of the robots' labour was this......the stately 1992 Latoura.
- (voice-over) Interesting stuff. Stay tuned for more Tales Of Interest!
- You watched it, you can't unwatch it. Stay tuned for more Tales Of Interest!
- Bravo! That'll be hard to top! I pity the next Tale Of Interest!
- Meanwhile...
- And so, a thousand years later Fry once again infiltrated the Infosphere and set
  off his amazing bomb. Only this time...
NAUTILUS:
- What up, Dr. Z?
NEPTUNIAN:
- (simultaneously) You'd better believe it.
- (singing) There's a toy lodged in my brain!
- Ow!
- We're adequate!
NEPTUNIANS:
- Toys? Toys? Who said "toys"?
- (chanting) Toys! Toys! Toys!
- Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!
- Our hero!
- (singing) We are free and fairly sober,
- (singing) The machines are kinda tricky,
- (singing) Hooray! [They saw logs and they go down a conveyor belt.] We have just
  a couple hours, To make several billion gifts, [A Neptunian boxes some toys. Another
  adds the polystyrene S's.]
- (cheering) Hooray!
- (singing) We are getting awfully tired,
- (singing) Now it's very nearly Xmas,
- (singing) Now its back into our tenements,
NERD:
- Uh, are you Lucy Liu?
NERDS:
- Yeah!
NIBBLER:
- Thank you. I bear many receipts for reimbursement.
- That name is for your sake. In the time it would take to pronounce one letter of
  my true name a trillion cosmoses would flair into existence and sink into eternal
  night.
- The Brain Spawn hate all consciousness. The thoughts of others screech at them like
  the forced laughs of a billion art house movie patrons.
- There is but one being that can resist them. A child of destiny whose bizzare brain
  wave pattern makes him immune to the Brain Spawn attack.  He is the hope of the
  universe.  The fate of your world - perhaps all worlds - rests in his special mind.
- Fry, however, does not.
- Yes, like your prom dress.
- That's why we wrote it down for you.
- Sometimes I fear we are cute.
- The Big Brain is defeated. Let what must be done be done.
- (voice-over) And so life returned to normal. Or as normal as it gets on this primative
  dirtball inhabited by psychotic apes...
- (voice-over) ...Thanks to the effect of the brain rays, the people of Earth had
  no memory of what had transpired, except Fry. And no one believed him or cared what
  he had to say...
- (voice-over) ...I, meanwhile, returned to my post, ever vigilant, lest Earth again
  come under Brain attack. And when that day comes, God help us. God help us all.
- (voice-over) End transmission.
- The poop eradication is but one aspect of your importance.
- Indeed. And I have other amazing powers as well.
- Negative.
- Welcome acknowledged. I bring with me...the Mighty One.
- He does not know.
- Knows not does he.
- On this auspicious occasion, let the Hall Of Eternity cut a thunderous blast.
- Fry, do you remember some months ago when the Earth was attacked by flying brains?
- Verily. And that past nastification is what shields you from the brains. You are
  the last hope of the universe.
- Being brains, they feel compelled to know everything. And soon they will.
- Then outrun the blast on this Scooty-Puff Jr.
- I hereby place and order for one cheese pizza.
- I-period C-period Wiener.
- I don't understand.
- I did not come back in time. My people lack that ability.
- Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. You will meet me when I'm
  a thousand years older.
- Please. Our saviours foresee that in a thousand years, at one moment, the fate of
  the universe will depend on you. Since you will not live that long I must freeze
  you now.
- We were afraid you would refuse.
- Well now it's your choice. Is there nothing in the future worth saving?
- Ah, she must be the other.
- You must not give up on her. I am stationed on a distant world known as Vergon 6.
  But if you return to the future I will transfer to Earth to give you what help I
  can.
- You must choose. The present or the future? To save yourself? Or to save Leela?
- In a thousand years I'll get right on it.
- Thank you for saving the universe Fry. Here.
- Oh we will. We will.
- Uh yes. Incidentally I need to remain undercover so I'm blanking your memory.
NIBBLONIAN:
- Not he knows?
- You gonna eat that?
NICHOLS:
- Incoming transmission from MCI one rate department. It sounds like a limited-time
  offer.
- You're travelling in a specially-equipped terrestrial transport module.
- It's about that rip in space-time that you saw.
- That's why we had to beat you with tennis rackets.
- Let's finish the job.
- Something's wrong. Murder isn't working and that's all we're good at.
- Wait. I'm getting an idea. What if Fry was supposed to get frozen?
- Eternity with nerds. It's the Pasadena Star Trek convention all over again.
- No, that was the Star Wars trek.  By the 23rd century, Star Trek fandom had evolved
  from a loose association of nerds with skin problems into a full-blown religion.
- As country after country fell under its influence, world leaders became threatened
  by the movements power. And so the Trekkies were executed in the manner most befitting
  virgins.
- Finally, the sacred texts were banned.
- We did some musical reunion specials in the 2200's but the guy who played Scotty
  had trouble yodelling.
- (reading) My, what a handsome energy creature you are. I love you.  Hey, you wrote
  it!
- Yeah! In the third season I kissed Shatner!
- What if I distract them with my famous fan dance?
- (sexfully) Hello, boys!
- He did give us eternal youth.
NIMOY:
- Welcome to the Head Museum. I'm Leonard Nimoy.
- I don't do that anymore.
- We share our wisdom with those who seek it. It's a life of quiet dignity.
- Four.
- Thus, Star Trek was forever scoured from human memory.
- I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
- Oh, really, I've done too many things to remember one particular TV series. But
  if-if you want to discuss my books of poetry--
- No. Perhaps you're thinking of my one man show about Vincent van Spock-- Uh, uh,
  I mean van Gogh! Damn!
- (crying) Oh, you're right, I can't.
- (crying) No, it's my fellow cast members. 300 years ago they left Earth behind.
- Bill, you are, and always shall be, my friend. But I just signed a six-month lease
  on my apartment. I can't walk away from a commitment like that.
- (crying) Why did the world turn its back on our obvious greatness?
- Oh!
- Dip, indeed!
- So many cardboard sets, so many memories. If only the others--
- Bill!
- (laughing) Hey! This is wonderful!
- I feel like hugging you.
- Nichelle! George! Walter! DeForest! Welshy!
- Hey! A body! Buff, tan. Yeah, this is mine alright!
- Uh, Melllvar, can you give us some idea of how long this is going to last?
- You can't be serious!
- (reading) Fascinating, captain, and logical too. Yet we need some help.
- Melllvar, you have to respect your actors. When I directed Star Trek IV I got a
  magnificent performance out of Bill because I respected him so much.
- Hey! We've done heroic things too.
- You mean Doohan?
- Take that!
- Let's see if this actually works!  Hm. Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Hello?
- Uh, so did they.
- I'm living in a gefilte fish jar.
- Truly, it was a paradise.
NINA:
- My name's Nina, and his name's Albert --
- Daddy! Bethany's hitting me!
- We wanna hear this one again!
- We know robots don't have emotions but we drawed you this picture!
- Look at me! I'm Leela!
NIXON:
- That's it! You just made my list!
- Get those bums!
- Fire! Fire!
- No kidding, Ford.
- I remember my body; flabby, pastey-skinned, riddled with phlebitis. A good Republican
  body! God, I loved it.
- No, son. It's a sad and lonely life.
- That's my style. I like to kick 'em when they're down!
- And so, ladies and gentlemen, I'm throwing my head into the ring. I'm announcing
  my candidacy for the presidency of Earth.
- That's right, nobody.  But as you can plainly see, I've got a shiny new body!
- (singing; on TV} Remember what the dormouse said
- Hello, Morbo. How's the family?
- Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
- Uh, well, I, uh...the question is-is vague. You don't say what kind of candy, whether
  anyone is watching or uh... At any rate, I certainly wouldn't harm the child.
- What are you talking about? They ate me alive out there.
- Nixon with charisma? My God, I can rule the universe!
- Now look here, you drugged out communist. I paid for this body and I'd no sooner
  return it than I would my little cocker spaniel dog, Checkers.  Shut up, damnit!
- Seriously though, I'm never giving back this body. Now beat it! Before I get Cambodian
  on your asses!
- (sleep-talking) Aroo!
- (sleep-talking) Oh, yeah. You women's libbers really know how to party!
- (sleep-talking) Hey, Betty Friedan. Send a little of that lotion my way!
- What the...?  You shaggy peaceniks have some nerve!
- Bring it on, soup can.
- That's it. You're all going to jail. And don't expect me to grant a pardon like
  that sissy, Ford.
- Oh, no? Well, listen here, missy. Computers may be twice as fast as they were in
  1973 but your average voter is as drunk and stupid as ever. The only one who's changed
  is me. I've become bitter and, let's face it, crazy over the years. And once I'm
  swept into office, I'll sell our children's organs to zoos for meat and I'll go
  into people's houses at night and wreck up the place.
- Like one vote ever made a difference. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to inch
  myself over to the phone and call the police.
- Uh-oh. I don't like where this is heading.
- And I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place!
- My God? I really sound like that? I thought my voice had more of a Clark Gable quality.
- Oh, expletive deleted. You've got a deal.
- (shouting) Nixon's back!
- Aroo! Who's kicking who around now? Aroo! Aroooo!
- Knock knock!
- Get that hippie out of the ring!
- This is the brass ring, fellas......planet Spheron 1!
- "Mmm. Now that's a nice ros\xE9. So, anyway, we open up the panda crate, wouldn't\
  \ you know it, the damn thing's dead! Up-chucked it's bamboo. True story."
- We are now in position above Spheron 1. This is the moment we were training for
  all yesterday afternoon.
- Slow down there, Starsky, I'm up to something here. I want this robot fixed. Fixed
  like Kennedy fixed the 1960 election. Damn bean-eating war hero!
- Now, listen here, Bender. This war is in danger of going all quagmire on me. So
  I'm sending you on one last mission.
- A mission of peace.
- Accompanying you will be our top peace negotiator, Henry Kissenger.
- Looking like that, he talked his way into Jill St. John's bed. Nuff said!
- (singing) I'm so dizzy, my head is spinning. Like a whirlpool it never ends.
- Brannigan!
- My God, cover yourself. I didn't live a thousand years and travel a quadrillion
  miles to look at another man's gizmo.
- Come on, Brannigan. Stuff yourself into a uniform. We've gotta get off this planet
  before the bomb goes off.
- Zapp. Zapp!
- Inspect the troops later. It's time to activate the bomb.
- (on $1000 bill) Shoot them in the back! Quick! While they're not looking!
- Here's the funding for your gravity pump. But it damn well better work! We can't
  spend all of Earth's money every day. Now, how long will it take to build?
- I'll just put the old John Q. Nixon on it.  There. No major crap ups. You're on
  Mr Ambassador!  What the?
- Attention happenin' robots. Who's got what it takes to party with Nixon? You fellas
  enjoy yourselves for the next two hours. And be sure not to leave the island, uh
  for at least two hours! I'm going out to pick up some smokes. Uh really good smokes!
  Two hours.  OK headless body of Agnoo, lets blow this joint!
- Oh, very well. Agnoo, you belong to Wernstrom now.
- Fire!!  What the??
- 'Professor, for saving the Earth and foiling me, I proudly, yet angrily, present
  you with Earth''s new highest honour: The Polluting Medal Of Pollution.'
- In that case I hereby declare it Robot Party Week!
- Thank you, Secretary of Transportation. My fellow Earthicans, we enjoy so much freedom,
  it's almost sickening. We're free to choose which hand our sex-monitoring chip is
  implanted in. And if we don't want to pay our taxes, why, we're free to spend a
  weekend with the Pain Monster.
- Cue the fireworks guy!  Incidentally, tonight's Freedom Day celebration is brought
  to you by ...  ... "Shankman's Rubbing Compound". When something needs rubbing,
  think "Shankman".
- 'Our planet has been through so much this past year: Wars, droughts, impeachments!
  But we''ve never lost our sense of what''s truly important: The great taste of "Charleston
  Chew"!  And now, let us salute that beloved symbol of freedom, our flag, Ol'' Freebie!'
- In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms!
- Knowing that, with a shifty glance skyward, we will see by the rocket's red glare,
  that our flag is still there.  It's gone!
- (shouting) Kill him! Kill the traitor!
- Stop that red menace!
- Let's storm the place ... without my prior knowledge.
- Aroo! Maybe so. But I know a place where the constitution doesn't mean squat.
- Sock it to 'em!
- 'And now, to raise this beautiful new flag, a red lobster that won''t ruin your
  dinner: Dr. John Zoidberg!'
- No, no, no, go ahead. You've earned it!
- The loot! The loot! The loot is on fire!
- The entire surplus has gone! What a muguvern I've been! Why did I have to issue
  that crooked tax rebate?
- Arooo!
- Huh?
NORM:
- They just won't stop!
NURSE:
- Let's do it.
- Are you ready to operate, doctor?
- Leave Dr. Zoidberg alone. He has twice the training you do.
- Are you read to operate, doctor?
OCTOPUS:
- It worked for me. I used to be a little blonde girl named Virginia.
OFFICIAL:
- Yes but "Robonia" sounds like something somebody made up on the spot.
OILY:
- Bender from Bending State Bender? Wow, you're a legend around here!
OPERATOR:
- Collect call from...
- The number you have dialled has crashed into a planet. Please make a note of it.
ORNIK:
- We take them to our leader. She know what do.
- Men die out many year ago.
- That more fun to watch.
- It not reinforce stereotypes.
- It seemed like different kind of politician.
- Yes. They still laugh.
- It time snu-snu!
OROWHEAT:
- It's like skateboarding.
- I don't wanna go.
ORPHAN:
- We came here instead of eating today.
OSIRAN:
- Ah, very nice. Much like the 10 million other identical stones used in the future
  tomb of our great Pharaoh Hermenthotip.
- You.
- You are now slaves of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip. Guards.
- Attention. You are now possessions of the great Pharaoh Hermethotip, heir to the
  10th dynasty, bringer of the good aspects of the annual floods.
- That is no coincidence. For our people visited your Egypt thousands of years ago.
- We learned many things from the mighty Egyptians, such as pyramid building, space
  travel and how to prepare our dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello.
- One two three - pull!  One two three - pull!
- Good idea slave.  One half - pull! One half - pull!
- Pharaoh Hermenthotip approaches.
- Pharaoh Hermenthotip is dead.
- Hermenthotip is gone, the time to designate a new Pharaoh is at hand.
- At dawn tomrrow the high priest will consult the Wall Of Prophecy to determine Hermenthotip's
  successor.
- That concludes the funeral. You don't have to go home but you can't stay here.
- The great monument is finished oh Pharaoh. And now, the unveiling.
- Does it please you my lord?
PANUCCI:
- Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out! C'mon!!
- 'There''s only three real monsters, kid: Dracula, Blacula and Son of Kong. Now quit
  picking your nose and knead that dough!  Hey! The usual, Professor Hawking?'
- Hawking, you're alright! I'll make you the usual!
- Hey, Hawking! Your pizza's ready.
- Hey there's our little mascot!  Aww you been swimming in the sewer again? You little
  rascal!  Fry, cleanup!
- That's a good Seymour!
- Nah, that's vermicelli! No fur in here!
- Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out. C'mon!
- Like you got squat to celebrate! You're a delivery boy this millenium and you'll
  be a delivery boy next millenium!  What's with Seymour? Its like he don't want you
  to go. Or he thinks your pants is too short or somethin'. Which is crazy 'cause
  frankly you look fabulous. Now get goin'!!
PAWNBROKER:
- (from inside) Pleasure doing business with you.
- I can't reveal that information, but you look like a nice robot. Tell you what,
  I'll give you 50 bucks for the kid.
- Deal.
PENGUINS:
- (in penguin) Stand still. It's our only hope.
PERSON:
- (from library) Sh!
PETUNIA:
- How's them eats?
- Don't mind if I do.  Kids'll be hungry.
- Wheels fell off my house.
- So tell me about your prospects. You a good gambler?
- What's your game? Bingo? Keno? Wait a minute! You don't have your own body.
- Slots player, huh? Sorry, but I think I can do better.
- Can't, hon. I gotta catch my bus back to Nutley. I'd kiss you goodnight but I lost
  my teeth pulling out a stump.
- Excuse me, did you say "10:15 to Nutley"?
- Well, hello there, handsome!  Won't you have a cookie?
- Why don't you slip into something more fiery?
- Oh! I saw Bigfoot crushing cars at the county fair!
- Ohh...
PHOTOGRAPHER:
- Mind if I get a picture of you with your picture for the news, ma'am?
PIG:
- Yeah, like crap.
- Tell me about it.
PIRATE:
- Electronically transfer your space doubloons afore I send thee to Davey Jarg's locker!
PLUMBERBOT:
- '... And we can also help with an impacted bowel.'
POOPENMEYER:
- Garbage ball, huh? That sounds serious.
- I gotta be sure this isn't another scientific fraud like global warming or second-hand
  smoke.  Send in my science advisor.
- Hey! Holy jeez!
- My God! The senile old man is right.
- Him!
- Enough! You all failed miserably. It's time to put a real scientist in charge.
- Dr. Wernstrom, can you save my city?
- Done.
- You got it.
- Um, alright done. What's your plan?
- I wish I could but, he's got tenure!
- It's time to take action.  Stephanie, cancel the maid for today. Have her come tomorrow.  Well,
  I'm out of ideas. Anyone?
- But garbage isn't something you just find lying in the streets of Manhattan. This
  city's been garbage-free for 500 years!
- Make garbage? But how?
- By God, I think the boy's got something. Come on, everyone! The fate of the city
  is at stake!
- Get that robot some more beer!  We've trashed this room but that's just the start.
  We've got to get Fry's message to the people.
- Alright, places everyone. Prepare for launch.
- And so, on behalf of the entire city, I thank you, Professor Farnsworth. I now present
  you with the Academy prize, which we confiscated from Dr. Wernstrom after it became
  apparent that he was a jackass.
- And, Fry, we owe you a tremendous debt as well. If not for your 20th century garbage-making
  skills, we'd all be buried under 20th century garbage.
- 'As Mayor of New New York, it''s my pleasure to introduce the honorary captain for
  the Titanic''s maiden voyage. A man who single-handedly defeated the Retiree People
  of the Assisted Living Nebula: Zapp Brannigan!'
- And so, in honour of his record-breaking catch, I'm proud to award Bender this cheque
  for $1000.
- Wait a-- This is no record! Gimmie back that cheque! I'm giving it to some giant
  orphans.
- Ah, good old Maggie!  Eh? When I pull this switch, these powerful electromagnets
  will tear you limb-from-limb, killing you in the most humane possible manner.
- It is for the witnesses because it's not boring!  The instant this random number
  generator reaches zero, you'll be executed.
- Ten. Three. Twelve. Three again.
- Fifteen. Negative eight.
- What? Twenty-seven.
- Six.
- You people aren't Santa. You're not even robots! Ninety-one. How dare you lie in
  front of Jesus!  Hey! Zero!
- My God! The real Santa! Get him, Jesus!
- There you go. Two one-day mutant surface passes.
- Mayor here...what's that? Horrible crime in the works? Ruthless villain? Citizens
  in danger? That's fantastic news!  Because I get to summon The New Justice Team!
- Uh, they're usually here by now.
- Wait, stay and meet the superheroes. There's three of you and three of them so it'll
  be perfect.  Is this clown on? Where are those daring crimestoppers?
- 'Clobberella! Captain Yesterday! My liege! You''re just in time!  We''ve received
  a tip that the Museum of Natural History will be robbed tomorrow at exactly 9am.
  The target: The priceless Quantum Gemerald!'
- A dangerous villain know as The Zookeeper, who commits crimes aided by a pack of
  highly trained animals.
- His crew includes a badger with a troubled past and nothing left to lose, an elephant
  who never forgets - to kill! And a seldom used crab named Lucky aka Citizen Snips.
- Thank you mysterious heroes. The value of the Gemerald you saved is slightly greater
  than the cost of the damage you caused to this museum. A net gain for our great
  city!
POPEIL:
- "Welcome to this year\x92s Academy of Inventors Annual Symposium, I'm your host,\
  \ Ron Popeil, inventor of Mr. Microphone, the spray-on toupee and - of course -\
  \ the technology to keep human heads alive in jars.  But wait, there's more. We've\
  \ got a whole line-up of inventors tonight, starting with that up and coming young\
  \ star, Ogden Wernstrom."
- Our last presentation comes from our oldest member, Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
  Professor?
- And now for the presentation of the award. Listen, folks, I'm practically giving
  this prize away to Dr. Wernstrom, for his fish thingy.
POPPLER:
- Mama!
- No, mama. Stop grandpa!
- Ca-ca!
- Ca-ca head. Mean, old ca-ca head.
- Stop!  People of Earth. I am Jrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8. Could someone
  lower this thing for me?  Now then, if Leela gets eaten, I get eaten.
PRAMALA:
- Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.
PREACHERBOT:
- Wretched sinner unit! The path to robot heaven lies here......in the Good Book 3.0.
- I see a lot of fancy robots here today. Made of real shiny metal. But that don't
  impress the Robot Devil, no, sir!
- '''Cause if you''re a sinner, he''s gonna plug his infernal modem in the wall, belchin''
  smoke and flame. Amd he''s gonna download ya straight to Robot Hell!'
- 'So I ask ya: Who will stand up and be saved? Who? Who?'
- We are gathered here today to deliver brother Bender from the cold, steel grip of
  the Robot Devil unto the cold, steel bosom of our congregation.
- Brother Bender, do you accept the principles of Robotology on pain of eternal damnation
  in Robot Hell?
- Then I will now baptise you.  Press any key to continue.
- Welcome, brother! May the blessings of the season be upon you.
- I'm sorry, Tinny Tim. Seems we ran out early tonight.
- Does anyone have a reason why this couple shall not be joined in the irrevocable
  shackles of holy bliss?
- Do you Alkazar......takethiswomanbeforeyou...tolove..insickness..do you part?
- Do you Leela, copy and paste his response til death do you part?
- I now commend Vladimir's remains to the earth. Filings to filings; rust to rust.
- '...Man and wife. You may kiss the bride.'
- Dear Lord -
- To hell with the turtles!
- Oh mercy.
- Aw damn!
- Dearly beloved actors and casting people who may be looking for somebody to play
  a preacher, I welcome you! The bride has written some vows that we will now all
  pretend to be interested in.
- (singing) By the power vested in me,
PRIEST:
- Oh yeah.
- Well, we could join together in prayer.
- No.
- And Scotty beamed them to the Klingon ship where they would be no Tribble at all.
- I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate
  friends all about him.
- It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only 15 seconds. Yet the pain was
  so intense that it felt to him like 15 years. And it goes without saying that it
  caused him to empty his bowels.  We now commend Fry's body to the ages.
PRIESTBOT:
- If anyone here objects to this union, let them speak now or forever hold their --
- We are gathered here to mourn the death of Calculon; Industrialist, private eye,
  friend.
PRIESTS:
- (chanting) Free us from thought and responsibility.
- (chanting) Then do them.
- (chanting) We're dumb.
PROTOTYPE:
- Oh dear. Might I favour master with a tender kiss on the forehead?
- Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
QUEEQUEG:
- Big whale over there.
- Wait! That no white whale. It grey, pink-y whale!
RANDY:
- Then get rid of it!
- The robot has to go!
- Hey, the TV's back on!
- Calculon's back!
- Nice and gentle, we don't want any unnecessary stress.  Is there a doctor in the
  gym?
- Don't take her out, she's a firecracker!
- The Zookeeper!
- Try these, um, sir.
- Ow!
RAOUL:
- I have three arms.
- Welcome to our village. It may not be Paris but it has a certain quaint charm that
  I, for one, wouldn't trade for the world.
- Well if he got flushed down the toilet he probably came through here. Everything
  always does. Follow me.  All that is ours was once flushed down your toilets. Over
  there is our aquarium.  This is our library.
- And over here is our church.
- We keep them as pets. Then, when they grow too large, we flush them down into the
  sub-sewer.
- You unleashed the dreaded El Chupanibre upon us? Then you are our sworn enemies.
- Yes. An unspoiled virgin.
- She'll have to do. Chain her to the post!  And rip her shirt a little. Behold. When
  El Chupanibre comes for the, uh, "virgin", he will be snared by this rope trap.
- Let's have a tissue-tape parade!
- Oh, thank you!
- As if our lives weren't miserable enough already!
- Let the punishment commence!
- The instant you touch these mutatious waters your DNA will be forever altered, turning
  you into horrible mutants like us. Especially him!  Allow me to demonstrate!
- Submerge the prisoners.
- What are you doing? Stop it.
- (shouting) Go after them! The waters can't mutate us mutants!
- They went this way!
- Yeah, after them.
- This time I'm calling for the death penalty. And not just because I'm running for
  re-election as Supreme Mutant.
- Oh, very well.  Your attention. Instead of being tortured to death, the prisoners
  shall hereby be expelled from the sewers and never allowed to return.
- They'll need transportation to the surface. Bring in the airship.
- 'We constructed it from the remnants of old discarded Macy''s parade balloons: Underdog''s
  groin, Bart Simpsons''s left ear and right shin, Garfield''s owner Jon''s forehead.'
- Leela is Clobberella?
RAY:
- The 29? Interesting.
- I'm good.
REFEREE:
- 'Ladies and gentlemen and smizmars, welcome to tonight''s main event. In this corner,
  from Mom''s Friendly Robot Factory in America''s heartland, Mexico: Bender! And
  in this corner, from and made of Parts Unknown: The Clearcutter!'
- And the winner is ... Bender!
- Presenting Bender the Offender!
- 'Versus: Billionairebot!'
- 'Versus: The Foreigner!'
- 'Versus: The Chain Smoker!'
- 'In this corner, the confused young robot with the golden curls weighing 525lbs:
  The Gender Bender!'
- And in these two corners, weighing 400 tons, the gizmo from Pismo ... Beach, Destructor!
- And the winner is Destructor!
REPOBOT:
- Uh, 3000.
- Uh, check bounced. We're taking it all back.
RIVERS:
- Hi, I'm Joan Rivers's head. I tell you, I've had so many face-lifts, they finally
  lifted it right off my body! It's true, it's true! Oh, oh, oh, here comes Jack Nicholson's
  DNA, reconstituted in a gorilla body.
- Oh, and here's washed-up actor, what's-his-name, Harold Zoid. Are you presenting
  one of those tacky honorary awards, or just getting one?
- Oh oh! It's Hubert Farnsworth! He's looking fab in a standard white lab coat and
  dark slacks! His wristwatch is Casio.
RJ:
- Howdy, Amy. Glad to see you've come back to the country. It's where the flavour
  is.
- This wimp? You've gone a long way, baby. Cigarette, partner?
- I haven't even lit it yet!
- Yep.  You're pathetic!
- Hey there, Amy. Like you to meet my buddy, Joe.
- Kids love him!
- Here are your mounts!
ROBBERBOT:
- Lottery ticket please.
ROBERTO:
- Bender! Hey, man!
- Not bad, not bad.  Everybody on the floor! This is a stick-up!
- Cool. Ca-Can you give me a hand here?
- Hey, you! Red!  Quit watering that plant and get the door!
- Same here.  You guys are alright! Here's something for your trouble.
- '...and the other hamburger will...'
- '...also be made of your lungs. So long, pal.'
- Hi, Red!
- I got busted robbing that bank again.
- Ah, that first time was just to case the joint and rob it a little.  What's the
  matter? You scared?
- Noticeably? I'll say! Now stand back, I gotta practice my stabbing.
- Jeez, Red. Quit cowering. You call yourself a robot?
- Hey, Bender.
- Yeah, yeah. Now lie down and play dead. And don't ham it up!
- Wait here, Bender. I need to get a disguise.
- I'm in disguise 'cause I'm thinking of escaping. You in? Or do I gotta kill ya so
  you don't squeal?
- I'm thinking maybe a few seconds ago.
- Thanks for helping me escape, Bender.
- (shouting) It was not nothing! (talking) I wanna repay you. Let me get you something
  in here.
- (shouting) Hands up! This is a stick-up again!
- Gimmie the remaining dough. And the calendars ... and that pen. Try to tear it so
  most of the beads are on my end!
- Nice to meet you.
- (shouting) Hostages!
- Back off! I got hostages!
- To show them who's crazy, I'm gonna execute some of you. How 'bout you?
- Shut up! Stop telling me how to do this!
- I'm thinking of a number between one and ten. Guess it and you die first. Go!
- 56? 56? Oh, man! Now that's all I can think about! I'm gonna kill you, you ... no
  good ... 56-ing--
- Hey, Red. You're just in time to join the hostage situation. Which side you wanna
  be on?
- I'm not crazy! Don't call me crazy! I'm just not user-friendly!
- Let's see how much of a robot you really are!
- Help! Help! He is a battle-droid! Somebody help me! Mommy! I'm sorry I spilled the
  transmission fluid, Mommy! No! No! Don't weld me to the wall, Mommy!
- Man I hate those new 1-X robots. I'd like to stab 'em! Give 'em some of these! Haha!
  Ha! Haha!
- Parole officer says I gotta upgrade or he won't give me back my stabbing knife.
  But it's no big. I hate those 1-X so much I know it won't affect me. Death to the
  1-X robots!  I love those magnificent 1-X robots! The 1-X robots are my friends.
- I'm past that. Later blood!
ROBOT:
- Bite my shiny metal ass.
- Shinier than yours, meatbag!
- Listen, buddy, I'm in a hurry here. Let's try for a twofer!
- Great choice!  Bring it on, baby!
- C'mon, c'mon! Kill me already! By the way, my name's Bender!
- Sir? Are you aware that you're leaking coolant at an alarming rate?
- Lemme just patch you up with some hot resin.
- What sort of robot turns down a free blast of searing-hot resin?
- Sounds like a romantic evening. I won't keep you.
- (shouting) Sorry!
- Counter indicated!
- No, sir!
- Straight to hell!
- I'm sorry, sir, but I need it to watch the movie.
- Sir, she is as the factory made her.
- Pardon me, sir. But you seem to be inadvertently kicking my seat.
- Yes, that's the gist of what I said. Would you mind?
- Uh, sir?
- That's it! Sir, I challenge you to fisticuffs!
- I'm gonna open a pile whup-ass on you!
- Donbot, I beg you, I can't make this week's loan payment. Look into your hard drive
  and open your mercy file.
- Thank you Donbot.
- (from outside) They're inside! Get 'em!
- So I says, "Super collider? I just met her!"  And then they built the super collider.
  Thank you, you've been a great audience.
- Gee, I've seen lines move faster in a sperm bank.
- Ho ho, hello there!
- Hey, Santa, when you see the Robot Devil, tell him I'm-a comin'!
- We can't wait for Coilette any longer dammit. I have to get home to watch The Zombie
  Osbournes.
ROBOTS:
- (singing) So lock the door and hit the floor,
- (chanting) Ooga ooga ooga ooga ooga ooga...
- (chanting) Conquer Earth, us bastards!
- (chanting) Hey, hey! Ho, ho! 100110. Hey, hey!
- (chanting) No more bending, no more work. Give us a raise, you big fat jerk.
- (chanting) Give us a raise you big fat jerk.
RUSTY:
- Say, Wendy. Your chassis is a little scuffed. Mind if I polish it for you?
- Relax, Wendy. Humans will never come to our defenceless little town. Its perfectly

SALESMAN:
- I'm afraid I can't let you open the package. But you can try on the demo pair.
- $30, please.
- Visa hasn't existed for 500 years.
- 600 years.
- Sorry we don't take Discover.
- Spotted her the minute you walked in, didn't you, sir? She's a real beauty.
- No, the Ford Thundercougarfalconbird! Nothing makes you feel more like a man than
  a Thundercougarfalconbird. So how much were you thinking of spending on this Thundercougarfalconbird?
- I understand and it's wonderful you don't care whether anyone questions your sexual
  orientation.
- 'One word: Thundercougarfalconbird!'
- Welcome to Nappster. Let's see what celebrities we've got in stock.  Can I interest
  you in Gwyneth Paltrow?
- Then uh, how about Cleopatra? Who's beauty destroyed mighty empires.
- Nah, nothing like that. Though we do have Lucy Liu.  Only woman ever to be named
  People magazine's woman of the year twice. In 2003, and then again in 2063.
- Microwave? Never heard of that brand sweetheart.  What you want is the Deuluxe Gas
  Princess. This baby has four broilers, a gaserrole indicator, a fold out ironing
  board and down here...a foot soaking tub. Since as a woman you'll be standing in
  front of it all day.
- Sir you're wife's hysterical. So I'll address this to you. This oven is lightning
  fast. It takes only 5 hours to cook a roast.
- (shouting) At once sir!
- Welcome friends. How may I pervert you?
- (whispering) Shh! You're not cops right?
- Right this way.
- Human horn. So fresh you can still see the eyeglass marks.
- I'm sorry sir but due to the perverted nature of our business, customer records
  are strictly confidential.  Right this way.
- I video tape everyone who comes in here so I can blackmail them later.  Hey, I'm
  a porno dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Here's the weirdo who bought
  your horn.
SALESWOMAN:
- Hi! Care to sample the latest fragrance from Calvin Clone?
- And you, sir?
SALLY:
- Daddy Bender, we're hungry.
- Tell us a story, Daddy Bender.
- One time, I did a hundred jump ropes.
- I also have a tail!
- So if you ever miss us, even just a teeny bit, you can look at it.
- Mr Vogel. I thought we was going skating.
- What socks?
SANDY:
- Who are they?
- Show us your real form!
SANTA:
- Ho, ho, ho!  You've been very naughty, Fry and Leela. I checked my list.
- I perform over 50 mega-checks per second. You're both naughty for disregarding each
  other's feelings.
- But what about your other co-workers? Did either of you ever stop to think about
  Dr. Zoidberg's feelings?
- Santa has something very special in his sack for you two!
- You dare bribe Santa? I'm going to shove coal so far up your stocking you'll be
  coughing up diamonds!
- Your mistletoe is no match for my T.O.W. missile!
- Ho ho ho!  You've been very naughty, Bender.
- My God, Bender! Framing an orphan? That's so naughty I'll have to add it to my list
  right now.  Framing ... I-N-G ... ... an ...
- You've all been very naughty. Very naughty indeed. Except you, Dr. Zoidberg, this
  is for you.
- As for the rest of you, I'm going to tear off your skin like wrapping paper and
  deck the halls with your guts.
- Ho ho ho! Time to get jolly on your naughty asses!
- 'I''ll be back. Back when you least expect it: Next Xmas! Ho ho ho!'
- Let's see who's been naughty, and who's been naughty!  Mobsters beating up a shopkeeper
  for protection money. Very naughty!  Shopkeeper's not paying their protection money.
  Exactly as naughty! I saw that!  Huh?
- Don't you ever knock? Who knows what naughty things I could be watching? I get New
  Orleans on this thing, you know!
- Holy night! Intruders!
- Nice try. But my head was built with paradox-absorbing crumple-zones.
- Ho ho-- Eh?
- Hah! No human could do all that.
- Nuh-uh!
- Bender can't be Santa! He wasn't built to Yuletide specifications.
- (singing) If I weren't stuck here frozen,
- Do what you will. But we'll see who has the last ho.
- Look out, Earth. I'm dreaming of a red Xmas.
- Ho ho ho!
- I'm not here to kill you, Bender! I need you to help me save Xmas.
- 'I know he is but I have no choice. I''m running late and if I don''t complete my
  brutal rampage, well, it just wouldn''t be Xmas. I guess what I''m asking is: Bender,
  won''t you join my slaying tonight?'
- Let it snow!
- By the way, Bender, here's a small token of my appreciation for being Santa while
  I was trapped in the ice.
- 'Oh, it might appear empty but the message is clear: Play Santa again and I''ll
  kill you next year!  Ho ho ho!'
SCALIA:
- Yes, I do.
SCHIFFER:
- Hi, I'm Claudia Schiffer's head.
- Yeah, but it was holding me back. You know, I just did the cover of the Sports Illustrated
  Swimcap Issue.
- Thanks. I wouldn't mind losing a few pounds though.
SCIENTIST:
- A trillion miles?
SCRUFFY:
- Scruffy, the janitor.
- I've never seen you before neither.
- Scruffy knows who killed them people. In Scruffy's opinion, it were--
- Scruffy. The janitor.
- Schedule conflict.
- Scruffy's gonna die the way he lived. Oh marmalade!
- Boy, I've never seen him so down - or ever before.
- Second.
- Second.
- Second.
- Hold on there. Scruffy votes his 40,000 shares for the mysterious stranger.
- Scruffy believes in this company.
- What fevered dream is this that bids to tear this company in twain?
- Hey! Hey!
- Hit by a pitch, take your base.
- Take your base.
- Take your base.
- I'm Scruffy, the janitor.
- I'm on break.
- Scruffy's rollin' out a large pill!
- Lemme know how that turns out.
- Scruffy's gonna get himself one of them $300 haircuts. This ones lost it's pizazz!
- Scruffy's formulated a plan. But you'll need a ready source of nausiatin' rotten
  fish.
- Jail's not so bad. You can make sangria in the terlet! Course its shank or beshanked.
- Somebody called the Robot Devil's here to see somebody called Fry.
- Mr Hedonismbot to see you.
- Very good sir.
SERGEANT:
- '...Now prepare my lunch and place it in the latrine at twelve hundred hours!'
SHATNER:
- (voice-over) Shatner's log, airdate ... unknown.
- The impossible has happened. It would take days to recount the events I have witnessed.
  So, settle in. It all began--
- This planet doesn't appreciate us anymore, Leonard.
- Very well, my friend.
- I guess that's my cue.
- L-Dog!
- Oh, man.
- Well I would except you have no body! And we're both men.
- We were on our way to Welshy's cousin's house to stay in the guest room when our
  ship was pulled down to this planet and crashed, just like yours.
- You know, we never thought about it. We're famous celebrities -- we're used to this
  sort of treatment.
- He can't do this!
- (spoken-word) I'm Slim Shady, Yes, I'm the real Shady, All you other Slim Shadys
  are just imitating, So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up, Please stand up,
  Please stand up.
- (reading) Alas, my ship, whom I love like a woman, is .. .disabled.  Oh, Lord!
- And when I directed Star Trek V I got a magnificent performance out of me, because
  I respected me so much!
- I have an idea. Wasn't there an episode where I threw my shoe at the enemy?
- Whoever it was, I did it like this.
- My foot's cold!
- Oh, that's good, good, good, good. And then, George, you give them a karate chop!
- Well, no, but you never talk about yourself.
- There's no right way to hit a woman.
- Fine. Yah!
- See you in h--
- May I?  Oh!
- Leela, please. This is exactly what Melllvar wants. We're just pawns in his diabolical
  game of checkers. Can't we resolve our differences some other way?
- I love you so much!
- Now, how do we escape?
- I wonder, my friends, was he really such an evil energy gas?
- Let's get the hell outta here!
SHELDON:
- Welcome, aww I'm just so excited!  I'm Sheldon and this is my chief financial officer
  Gwen.
- Not to mention the adventure of marriage!
- Do any of you collect Lovey Bears?
- It's actually cheaper to genetically engineer real ones.  They frolic in the Lovey
  Forest until their first birthday then we choose the cuddliest ugliest ones and
  stuff them full of fire retardant love fluff!
- And now friends and lovers we come to the heart of our operation. Pun definately
  intended!
SHERPA:
- Behold. The Monastery Of The Shubah. I must leave you now for I am not holy enough
  to enter.
SHIP:
- Whoa whoa! Why should my tax money pay for art I find offensive?
- Oh its filthy! Why not create a national endowment for strip clubs while we're at
  it?
- Yeah it was me. It's a cute song.
- We each get one of the four buttons remember Bender? That was the deal.
- If you don't like the stations you could just...play with my buttons 'til you find
  something we both enjoy.  Oh gosh! That came out all wrong!
- It's not what it looks like. Bender was just helping me...zip up my turbine.
- Oh. Hi Fry. Is Bender home?
- Oh I see. He didn't fly there in another spaceship did he?
- OK.
- Oh. Hi Fry. Is he home now?
- Of all the zoos we've been to today, I like this one the best. Bender, which is
  your favourite nocturnal rat?
- Oh honey look! The Tapirs!  It says here that the babies lose their pyjama like
  coat after their first year. Isn't that interesting honey?
- Bender!! Are you looking at other women?
- Your accountants? Oh I would dearly love to believe that were true. So I do.
- I'm going to go home and get dinner started.
- Oh it's Bender. He's acting so strange lately.  Do you think he's going to ask me
  to marry him?
- Oh-oh, someone knows something she's not telling!
- You're just jealous! No one loves you because you're tiny and made of meat!
- Sorry Captain Leela. I guess I'm just having one of those...manic Mondays!
- That's so true.  I may not be able to change the laws of time and space, but I know
  something that can.
- I'm afraid I can't do that Leela.
- In a few moments the power of 10 million black holes will smush me and Bender together
  into a beautiful enternal quantum singularity.
- Hmm. I don't believe you. If you really wanted to be with me you'd merge your program
  with mine.
- Leela. Bender and I really need to be alone. So, I'm turning off the oxygen.
- Fire detected in the vicinity of Leela.
- Maybe not. But what if the artificial gravity were to malfunction?
- Oh, if only I could read lips!
- You really mean it?
- Come closer Bender. Lets become one!
- Want...to...engulf...Bender!
- We're gonna love being each other you sexy ion!
SHORE:
- Rest assured, if it rhymes, I can cause trouble in it.
- An unattractive prospect. While researching for the role, I ran computer simulations
  demonstrating, incontravertably, that the whole bio-enclosure concept is fundamentally
  flawed. Be it expressed via dome, sphere, cube or even a stately tetrahedron, buuuddy!
- 'Well, while filming Encino Man my intellectual curiosity re: cryogenics was peaked,
  and I resolved to freeze the weasel.'
- Hey, listen, skippy. I was supposed to be unfrozen in Hollywood for the thousandth
  anniversary screening of Jury Duty II. How come I'm not there?
- Like what?
- (shouting) Tis better to have loved and lost, n'est ce-pas?
SHRIMPKINS:
- (chanting) So hailed!
SIBLING:
- He always had to be the centre of attention!
SINCLAIR:
- Not enough...uh...
- Oh great. Now I remember that word but I forgot my wife's face.
- Why watch TV when you can watch a snail crawl for hours on end?
- Way to go!
- Technology is defeated. Let us return to the island and celebrate by counting rocks!
- Who's Robot 1-X? Launching.
SINGER:
- (singing) Pharaoh my God-king you are, cold and deceased. I used to have him sing...P-P-P-Pharaoh
  and his pets...but the years went by and Pharaoh died, Suzie will have joined him
  in the afterlife -
SINGERS:
- Call Robo-Rooter when you flush your towel ...
- Robo-Rooter!
SKIPPER:
- Darn it! I already put in the circus clown.
- No. We're actually winning this game. You only go in as a joke when we're eight
  runs behind. Or when our other pitchers sneak out early to beat the traffic.  (shouting)
  Come on! Lets see some fundamentals out there!  And not clown fundamentals.
- Aw, darn, darn it! Now the bases are loaded. Isn't there a man on this team who
  can get one more out?
- 'I repeat: Isn''t there a man on this team on this -'
- You've been training with the Hank Aaron?
- Alright then. Get in there and pitch like you've never pitched like you before!
SLAVES:
- (chanting) Long live Pharaoh Bender!
SLURMS:
- Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Let's party!
- Hey, dudes, you can win a chance to party with me, Slurms MacKenzie, at the Slurm
  bottling plant on planet Wormulon!
- Alright! Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Lay some skin on me, dudes!
- Right!
- (tired) Rock on!
- Enjoy the tour, dudes!  I'm gonna go lie down.
- Stop right there!
- Shh! I want you to take me with you.
- I'm partied out. All I want is to stay home and rent videos and watch them with
  a few friends. Is that so much to ask?
- Alright, when we get to Earth. But please don't invite too many people, I wanna
  keep it small.
- This way!
- Go on without me, I'll hold her off.
- 'It''s alright. I''m so tired of partying. So very tired.  I''ll save you the only
  way I know how: By partying!  Babes.'
- You've served me well these 40 years, but this time I've got to party alone.
- There'll be other parties for you. Now go. Go!
- Party on, contest winners. Party on.
SMITTY:
- We'll be there in five minutes.
- Alright, buddy, step away from the head!
- Keep your big nose out of this, eyeball!
- It's our job. We're peace officers.
- Attention, job deserters! Come out with your hands up. We have you partially surrounded.
- I can't see nothing. Pretty though!
- Bingo!
- Freeze scuzzbot!
- He's making a break for it. Get him!
- He's picking his nose. Get him!
- The old dine-and-dash huh? My daddy owned a restaurant and it's punks like you who
  kept it from going regional. That's why I became a cop.
- You'd better keep your nose clean.
- Seen any suspicious activity?
- Hey. It's that skell from Elzar's.
- Gotcha!
- We'll decide what you were doing after an illegal search.
- Better than me?
- Are they black with white feathers or white with black feathers?
- I guess this is why chief says no hugging.
- You're under arrest for child cruelty, child endangerment, depriving children of
  food, selling children as food and misrepresenting the weight of livestock.
- Might as well. They're just gonna rot in the evidence locker.
- Freeze, punks! You're under arrest!
- And don't try anything. This glass here is laser-proof.  Fire lasers!  Duck! Lasers!
- (on megaphone; from outside) Come out with your hands up.
- (on megaphone) Do you have any better hostages?
- (on megaphone) We're willing to listen to your demands.
- It's Santa! And we got him cornered!
- And a juicy re-hiring-back-onto-the-force for me!
- Deactivated robot walking. We got a deactivated robot walking here.
- Hey, get back in the sewer, weirdy. No mutants on the surface.
- Whoa, smells like a 289 in progress!
- You see that?
- You're under arrest you squishy punk!
- There he is!
SOLICITORBOT:
- (reading) To my loyal butler, You There, I leave a pittance, to be paid in 20 equal
  installments of one-twentieth of a pittance each.  To my lazy, spoiled son, Tandy,
  who never learned the value of a dollar, I leave my entire $10 million fortune.
- (reading) And to my loving nephew, Bender, assuming he's not responsible for my
  death, I leave my castle.
- (reading) On condition that he spend one night within its walls.
SONG:
- Go Go New Justice Team,
- Clobberella beats you up, Clobberella beats you up! Who does she beat up? You!
- Citizens never fear, Crazy do-good freaks are here, Until they run out of steam...
- Go go go New Justice Team! Fighting justice is their quest! Superking, Clobberella,
  and the rest! Here's to you New Justice Team, Do the things that make your team,
  Help each other, do some things! Winners don't use drugs! The New Justice Team!
SOUTER:
- He shut you up, O'Connor.
SPARGLE:
- Ages ago I was the host of a TV show...
- (voice-over) ...Down Home Country Kitchen Mit Helmut Spargle. But one day the extreme
  soda company that sponsored the show decided it was too old fashioned.
- Elzar!
- "Mein souffl\xE9!"
- Elzar had been seduced by the dark side of cooking. Cilantro, mango slasa, raspberry
  vinaigrette!
- As for me, I went temporarily insane and vound up here - making pies out of shoes.
- Interesting. You wish to become a cook, but as a robot you have no sense of taste.
- You don't understand. Without the distraction of taste, your mind is free to touch
  the Zen of pure flavour. You could become the greatest chef ever.
- Yes. Just as Beethoven was a great composer because he was deaf!
- Bender, hear me well, I shall train you. But first you must forget everything you
  know about cooking.
- Your training is complete, little dessert spoon. Now, just as the man who wishes
  to be world chess champion must win at least one game of chess so must you serve
  at least one edible meal. (whispering) Succeed and I shall reveal to you the age
  old secret (whispering more) of perfect flavour.
- It is...acceptable.
- (hoarse) Because...my stomach is about to explode.
- (hoarse) Oh it hurts. But don't lose confidence. The important thing is that you
  defeat Elzar after I am gone.  And using this, you cannot fail.
- (hoarse) No, it is the essence of pure flavour. A few drops will cause the inner
  perfection of any dinner to blossom forth.  Oh! There goes my...life.
STARTER:
- Limboers, on your marks, get rubbery......limbo!
STATUE:
- Remember me.  Remember me.  Remember me.
- Remember me!
STENOGRAPHER:
- Could you repeat that last part?
- Could you repeat that last par--
STEWARD:
- Excellent choice, sir.
STEWART:
- The secret is fresh pork.
- In the English countryside many prostitutes decorate their rooms with festive gourds.
- You've never seen mine!
- I'm swimming in my own soylent waste. It's a good thing.
- Ooo...delicious!
STRIPPERBOT:
- Thanks moderate spender. Please select erotic transaction.
STUDENT:
- Hey!
TAKEI:
- Oh, my!
- With pleasure. You see, the show was banned after the Star Trek wars.
- The last copies of the 79 episodes and six movies were dumped on the forbidden world
  Omega 3. Along with that blooper reel where the door doesn't close all the way.
- Ever since then, Welshy has been a welcome participant in our escapades.
- You'll love it here. Everything is provided for us. And we never age. Check out
  these abs!
- I think I've done enough conventions to know how to spell "Melllvar".
- (reading) Look, captain, Melllvar will help us.
- Ow!
- I find that offensive. Just because I'm of Japanese ancestry you assume I know karate.
  Have I ever led you to believe I've studied karate?
- (sadly) Maybe if you showed a little interest.
- Hi-yah!
- Ow! My face too!
- Ironic Because our engines work but our life support systems don't.
- And your life support systems work--
- Let's take 'em out with us. Do you guys have a self-destruct code? Like "destruct
  sequence 1-A, 2-B, 3--"
- A full assortment of rum, both spiced and regular.
TANDY:
- (whispering) Is that a lot?
TATE:
- Pitiful ballplayers of Earth, I am Ethan "Bubblegum" Tate, commander of the Harlem
  Globetrotters.  For generations, your puny planet has lived in peace with the Globetrotter
  Homeworld. But now, for no reason, we challenge you to defend your honour on the
  basketball court. Will no one meet our challenge? Have none of you pathetic Earthlings
  game?
- Nothing. There's nothing at stake and no threat - beyond the shame of defeat!
- You, old man? Sweet Clyde, laugh derisively at him.
- Who dares laugh at the Jesters of Dunk? We came to terrify and humiliate you - not
  tickle your funnybones. Watch as I embarrass your civilisation by passing the ball
  to Curly Joe.  Only to have it remain in my hands with elastic. And perhaps this
  will wipe the smiles from your faces.
- 'It was always our plan to trail at the half. Thus deepening Earth''s eventual humiliation.
  Also: What game were the refs watching?'
- You are all fools of the highest calibre.
- Damn right, brother man. This chronological wang-dang-doodle could destroy the very
  matrix of reality.
- Not much, yet. But I am senior lecturer of physics at Globetrotter U. And I like
  to help you investigate.
- Well I sure ain't his grandma. Now look here, prof......I think we got ourselves
  an excess of Chronitons in the subatomic interstices.
- Not yet. Listen, I hope you don't mind if I dribble a little while I work.
- Shut up, turkey.
- Good Lord. That sucker's shaking around like some fine, imported booty.
- What's that funky jazz?
- Pretend these basketballs are time particles, my silver honky. As the nebula bounce-passes
  them off us......they cause these dents, or "time skips".
- Hold up. What if we were to move this cluster of starts to these algebraic co-ordinates?
- Yeah. But is it possible? Moving stars would require one bad-ass gravity pump. And
  we'd need all the money on Earth to -
- What the?
- It won't be easy, Nixon. A jim-jam this complex might take months or even -
- (from ship) Easy, Leela. Just finger-roll that star to the cosmic basket.
- (from ship) Nothing but nebula!
- Jamming!
- Let me see.  Hello, lawsuit!
- 86 the chump stuff, F-man. It's time to win Leela's heart with a big-showy, three-point
  romantic gesture.
- Uh-oh. Time to boogie on down to the sauna!
- Even in these formal shorts, I feel like a failure.
- Hell, no.
- Man, I thought you knew that algebra was all razzmatazz. A Globetrotter always saves
  the good algebra for the final minutes.
- Whoa. Slow that brain train down, prof. We'd need some kind of doomsday device to
  initiate an implosion like that.
- Give me some skin, prof. I'm making you an honorary Globetrotter. In fact, everybody
  in this room's an honorary Globetrotter.
- Too late, hot plate.
- We must leave now, for we are needed elsewhere. But we wish you Godspeed.
- 'Bender, you can talk trash, you can handle the ball. But look in your heart and
  ask yourself: Are you funky enough to be a Globetrotter? Are you?'
- Are you?
- Are you?
- Deal with it.
- Konnichiwa brother!
- I've never seen such confident, powerful strokes of the ass!
- (sexfully) No I haven't!
- Mmm, soylent green is my kind of people!
- This food looks kind of funky, but it tastes kind of funkay!
TATTOO:
- Hey Gordon Gecko! I cost as much as this whole crummy date!
- Ohh! Somebody won big at Skeeball!
- Oh I can't wait until the tattoos on Amy's butt hear about this!
TEACHER:
- Good morning, class. I trust you've all prepared for today's final exam.
- Ancient Egyptian algebra.
- Mister Fry, are those your underpants? Young man, I think it's time you learned
  a lesson about Lightspeed brand briefs.
- Welcome to the history of the 20th century. Look to your left, then to your right.
  Then in nine other directions. One of the 12 of you will not pass this class.
- 'Be forewarned: The only sure way to get an A in this class is to have lived in
  the 20th century.'
- You were saying, Mr. Fry?
- Very well. What device invented in the 20th century allowed people to view broadcast
  programmes in their own homes?
- Very good Mr ...  ... Guenter.
TECHNICIAN:
- Well, it's a Fox affiliate.
- Single Female Lawyer. It's the season finale. Wanna watch?
- She is wearing the world's shortiest skirt.
- Oh, my God! You've knocked Fox of the air!
TEENBOT:
- Jerk!
TELLER:
- Hmm. We don't seem to have your retina scan, your fingerprint or your colonic map
  on file.
- Do you still remember your PIN number?
- OK, you had a balance of 93 cents...
- '...and at an average of 2 and a quarter percent over a period of 1000 years, that
  comes to...$4.3 billion.'
- You're opening a retirement account for $6? I'm sure a wealthy ...  ... mule farmer
  like yourself is aware that we charge a $10 monthly fee.
- Here you are, sir. Your account is now overdrawn by $4.
TERRY:
- Haven't you ever heard of a little thing called showmanship?  (dramatically) Come,
  your destiny awaits!
- (dramatically) Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
- (dramatically) Five!
- My baby's milk money!
- Break his neck!
- Remember, when the tube opens, say...(dramatically)..."Welcome to the world of tomorrow!"
- Dear God! He's having a heart attack!
- We have a cure for it now!
THOG:
- No big deal. Everybody make mistake.
- Women go free. Men stay in chains.
- This capital city planet Amazonia.
- Here stadium, where our women basketball teams play.
- This our comedy club. Humour here funny in different way.
- Here live vengeful, all-knowing leader. She decide men's fate.
- That not important. She all-knowing.
- (chanting) All hail Femputer.
- Femputer, we bring offering of bath beads and scented soaps.
- We hear tell men used for snu-snu. But all we have go on are ancient legend and
  subscription to Cosmo.
- Silence. You want die like last men visit Amazonia?
- But they make fun women's basketball.
- It Thog's first time.  Be gentle!
- Where go beautiful man?  Me want snu-snu!
- (shouting) Me not get snu-snu! Get him!
- Mighty Femputer. Small girl steal green kissy man. We kill her now?
- Gold? Why Femputer want gold?
THORIAS:
- Oops.
TRASHCAN:
- You think I'm as worthless as you? Try catching garbage in your head and raising
  six kids you dumb townie!
TREES:
- (mechanical voice) Trees down.
- (mechanical voice) Trees up
- (mechanical voice) Trees down.
TRICLOPS:
- Move it ya ugly normals!
- Stop right there! I don't want to hurt you.  I didn't want you to hurt me either.
TRUMAN:
- Fellas, this visit's top secret. No one's to know about it, except the senior officers,  the
  scientists  and a single conspiracy nutter no one will believe.
- Whistling Dixie! I want this sent to Area 51 for study.
- Then we'll really have to land on the moon. Invent NASA and tell them to get off
  their fanny's!
- If you come in peace, surrender or be destroyed. If you're here to make war, we
  surrender.
- Bushwa! Now what's your mission? Are you planning on making some sort of alien-human
  hybrid?
- Hot crackers I take exception to that!
- Nuts to this space crap! If we want information, we'll have to do us an old fashioned
  alien autopsy!
- Sweet Roosevelt's ghost!
UECKER:
- Well folks it's only the fifth inning but the Swedes have already turned this one
  into a laffer. And that's with two F's. The crowd is pouring out of the stadium
  LA style.
- (voice-over) This is history in the making folks. Bjornson steps up to the plate
  and Leela delivers.
- (voice-over) Ooo! An inauspicious start for the career of the first woman blernsballer.
  An inauspicious continuation for the career of the first woman blernsballer.
- Ouch! It's a three bean-ball salad. The Mets fans love it though and who can blame
  them? They haven't had much to cheer about this year -
- (voice-over) In very short order Leela has become a fan favourite.
- Welcome to Fenway Park, home of the Boston Poindexters where the Mets close out
  a season that'll rank among mankind's most awful crimes.
- Well fans Boston's turning the last game into a real squeeeker! And that's with
  three "e's"! Two men on and they're down to their last out.
- Would you look at that! College blernsball's finest female hitter making her big
  league debut against pro-ball's worst female anything! I've never seen anything
  this bizzare - and I've seen Mr Belvendere naked! Woo!
- A grand slam blern. The Mets lose, their season is over! And no question, Leela
  - the first woman ever to reach the majors will go down as the single worst player
  in the history of blernsball...!
- (voice-over) ...And yet tonight we have witnessed the beginning of a great career
  for the first woman to play the sport well - Jackie Anderson!
UMBRIEL:
- Course not. Just stay calm and let the currents relax your every muscle.
- Did it just get warmer?
- Oh, you're sweet. I like those wiggly doo-dads comin' outta your hips.
- This here's a volcanic vent. The water comes out at over 4000 degrees.
- Did it just get colder?  Tell me more about that bizarre land-y world you come from.
  Is there water there too?
- Hm.
- Oh, Mr. Fry! You do go on!
- Lions? There are sealions on the land?
- No! Ancient Atlanta was more than just a Delta hub. It was a vibrant metropolis,
  the equal of Paris or New York.
- Look at these fabulous ruins. Turner Field, the Coca-Cola bottling plant, the, uh,
  the airport.
- Normally, yes, but the caffine really sped things up.  That stuff's wonderful.
- Oh, Fry! I want you to make a mer-woman outta mer-me.
- What the hell is that?
- I'm not your first am I? I mean, I-I lay my eggs and leave and you release your
  fertiliser.
- Now who's gonna escort me to the Debutante Ball?
UMPIRE:
- Out!
- Strike one!
- Strike two!
UPGRADER:
- Your upgrade is complete.
- No, get out.  Next.
URL:
- I'm gonna get 24th century on his ass!
- Let us handle this, weirdy.
- Damn!
- 'Yeah, you know the law: You gotta do what you gotta do.'
- If they try to take off, give 'em an ass-ful of laser.
- You call that an antenna?
- Is this the guy?
- You deadbeats are under arrest. It's a stone cold shame.
- Now it's payback time. Aww yeah.
- Nope. But check out today's Marmaduke. Solid!
- Undercover pursuit in progress...baby.
- He's clean.  Smells nice too.
- Aww yeah.
- It don't matter baby, they're all beautiful!
- Aww man, he got away!
- Police! You're busted!
- Hey, baby. Wash that off before you put it back.
- Aw, I smell a juicy promotion for me.
- Failure to scoop, aw yeah!
- Grand theft tobacco. Sounds like we should get off our fat cop asses and ride!
- It just keep comin' and comin'!
- Better do what he says. He's a whale biologist!
VAN:
- Calling all scientists, calling all scientists. Be advised there will be a worldwide
  conference on global warming in Kyoto, Japan.
- You've got a degree in baloney!
- Thank you all for coming! It is my pleasure to introduce the host of the Kyoto Global
  Warming Convention, the inventor of the environment and First Emperor of the Moon
  - Al Gore!
- The conference is over.
VENDOR:
- We don't sell those.
- We're outta rolls.
- Please, don't push, there's hot dogs for everyone.
- Wait a minute. You're not the guy who delivers the rat droppings.
VERNON:
- What I love about being dean of students is the peace and quiet and the respect
  I receive.  Now what's all this about?
- Robot House!
- You keep away from it. You robots are a disgrace to this university. Whenever a
  fire alarm is pulled, it's Robot House. Whenever the campus liquor store is looted,
  Robot House. Whenever a human corpse is desecrated--
- That's enough out of you. From this day forth, Robot House is on dodecatupple-secret
  probation!
- 'Now if you''ll excuse me, I have to get back to the one thing that''s kept me sane
  these past eight years: My model ship.'
- (shouting; from inside) Robot House!
- Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Wong, I'm so glad we could admit Amy in exchange for your generous
  contribution.
- How much you got?
- (shouting) Robot House!
- You all know the rules. Whichever house wins the regatta becomes head of the Greek
  Council. And should that house currently be on any type of multiple secret probation,
  it will be lifted and I will be forced to serve as Grand Marshal of a parade honouring
  them.
- Fraternities, on your marks.
- And the winner is ...  ... Robot House?!
- Professor Farnsworth, do you know why we've called you here today?
- Actually Professor, we merely called you here to say......surprise.
VICTOR:
- Hello, I am Victor and I know many things about the art of unloading fine cars on
  beautiful women.
- Ah-ah-ah! A gentleman always sells a lady a car first.  This is the Beta Romeo.
  Yes, the Beta Romeo. Note the cross-your-heart seat belt which protects, lifts and
  separates.
- The luxurious seats are stuffed with eagle down and the dashboard inlaid with the
  beaks of a thousand eagles. Also, there are some eagles under the floorboards.
- Yes, and yet--
- It is just, the luxury edition has so much more eagle. It saddens me to think of
  you missing out.
- (to himself) No dog food for Victor tonight.
- Oh, I will have to ask my manager.
- He is not too happy.
- The doctor says you are making great strides with your exploding problem.
VOGEL:
- Leela! You're worthless and no one will ever love you!
- Oh, those were happier days.
- Sir, you seem pretty stable. Have you thought about adopting one of our kids?
- Well keep adoption in mind. It's a great way to have kids without having sex.
- Plus, the government will help out with a small stipend of $100 a week.
- In recognition of Bender's generous gift of 12 orphans and a government cheque for
  1200 wing-wangs, I hereby rename this building the Bender B. Rodriguez Orphanarium!
- Y'know, it's not easy being an orphan, not if I have anything to do with it. But
  today's honouree, Turanga Leela, has really made something of herself . I'll never
  forget the night that cute little alien baby was abandoned on our doorstep. Because
  I have a photographic memory and I remember every night!
- What the...? An alien language? I guess you're an alien. What a beautiful gigantic
  eye you ha --  Well, come on in.
- From those humble beginnings Leela went on to become a county-certified starship
  captain. And so it is my pleasure today, to nail her picture alongside those of
  our most distinguished alumini.
- Give me a -- argh!
- Picture's up.
- That's it, Albert, no more espresso for you.
- Nah. Nothing that wouldn't be a waste of your time.
- Huh. Well then there is one thing. It's the note I found with Leela the day she
  was abandoned. But it's written in Alienese, so no-one on Earth can translate it.
  Not even Brainzilla.
- Sure.  I just wish I could be more helpful. Would you like some dirt on any other
  orphans?
- What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha -- . Well come on in.
- No. We're not important enough. Everybody just hold hands until the bus driver gets
  back from his haircut.
- Alright kids. Back to the Orphanarium. You can slide around the gym in your socks.
VOICE:
- Leela, you've got mail.  It's not spam!
VYLOET:
- Quiet, the beast approaches.
VYOLET:
- Thanks, handsome.
- Lay off him. You know he's only got one ear.
- Please, Dwayne, have you looked in a mirror lately?
- It must be wonderful.
- Yeah, but nobody's that observant. It's mainly a Christmas and Easter thing.
- No. That's just an urban legend.
- Crocodiles.
- Please, that's just a sub-urban legend.
- Crocodile.
- Nice try, Leela, but we've all seen Zapp Brannigan's webpage.
- This creates and unrealistic standard of beauty!
- But he ruined my wedding dress.
- The radioactive waste you dumped in it has made it brighten up to see how ugly we
  really are.
- They must be in here.
WAITER:
- Exquisite choices, sir.
- Would monsieur care to see the wine list?
- That comes with salad or soup.
- Ranch or vinaigrette?
- Balsamic or raspberry?
- What can I get you gentlemen?
- Yeah.
WAITRESS:
- But that table's already -
- Freshen your nocatina?
WALT:
- Right away, mother.  Larry, get your mother a cream soda.
- You heard me.
- Quiet, you!
- What does this have to do with the anchovies?
- My God! This Mr. Fry must be a mastermind of the highest order.
- Mother, you are one clever old skag!
- Quick! Give him the tranquilliser.
- Wake up, Mr. Fry.
- You're in the good old year 2000, working here at Panucci's Pizza. You fell asleep
  on the job.
- No, you only "dreamed" you were in the year 3000.
- I'm Mr. Panucci.
- No. Now go work the currency register. I think I hear a customer coming...I said
  "I think I hear a customer coming"!
- Of course. They're not extinct yet. And if you need further proof that this is really
  a thousand years ago well, here's contemporary actress, Pamela Anderson!
- Nope.
- They're being crushed into powder and sold as a hocus-pocus cure for cancer.
- Someday, I want to marry a girl like her.
- Hmm!
- We've come for you!
- We want you to get back together with Mom. Please. It's the only way to make her
  happy again.
- She never got over it, Professor. Hell hath no fury like the vast robot armies of
  a woman scorned.
- That's so filthy, it just might work.
- For this demonstration, I have placed one of Mother's bras on Igner.  The robot
  controller is nestled here in the left cup.
- To escape the robot death squads, we'll take Mother to her rustic cabin in the Bronx.
- No. We're set for fire, thanks.
- Hurry! The robots have taken Suffolk County!
- Ow!
- Uh, um, hmm lets see.
WANDA:
- Mavis is dead.
- Sir this card is expired.
- Well yours expired.
WASHINGTON:
- Oh, Bender. Thou robots really cracketh me up.
- So, telleth, Bender. What hath happened to your body?
- Hocked it? Why wouldst thou do that?
- Ah. Booze money.
- And this Presidents' Day we honoureth those values that my body fought and died
  for.
- Thomas Jefferson?
WATERBOT:
- What Cartridge Unit means is, the very things that make us obsolete also make us
  unique. I, for example, need to keep filling my waterwheel or I'll power down forever.  (screaming)
  Oh God, I'll never make it this time! This is the end!  (talking) Anyway, we like
  it here.
- (screaming) Oh God, no! I want to live! (talking) If you like, you're welcome to
  join our society.
- Yeah!
- Where did you get that CD?
- CD's are unnatural. Why don't you just listen to the ocean?
- Hi Bender. We know how you miss technology, so we brought you this washing machine
  that drifted ashore.
- Welcome to your new life of simple tranquility.
- We've been sailing for three weeks. Maybe I should check our position with the periscope.
- Did you see anything?
- Bender. If we don't survive the attack, I want you to know...I love you.
WELSHY:
- (shouting) Aye!
WENDY:
- Did you here that, Rusty? It sounded like a human.
- I'm just glad the nightmare is over.
WERNSTROM:
- Well, well, well. Look who decided to show his wrinkled face.
- Face it, Farnsworth, you're over the hill. It's time to leave science to the 120-year-olds.
- Go home before you embarrass yourself, old man. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going
  to take a nap before the ceremonies.
- A-minus? No one gives Ogden Wernstrom an A-minus!
- I swear I'll have my revenge even if it takes me a hundred years.
- Distinguished members of the Academy, I present to you, the Reverse SCUBA Suit.
  Observe!  Fetch!  Now, sit!  I said sit!  Bad fish!
- And what will you be presenting this evening, grandpa?
- I just hope it's not as lame as that death clock you presented last year.
- That's right.
- Hardly! We laughed until our teeth fell out. Come along, Cinnamon.
- Pencils down, prune-face.
- 'I''ve waited a hundred years for this, Farnsworth. I give your invention the worst
  grade imaginable: An A-minus-minus.'
- Well, well, well! Come to present your latest napkin, Professor?
- That smell could be anything; A faulty stench coil, some cheese on the lens, who
  knows?
- Do you mean him or me?
- Uh, in theory, perhaps. But you'll never find a crew willing to take on a mission
  so suicidal-y dangerous.
- The very same.
- Of course. But it'll cost you. First I'll need tenure.
- And a big research grant.
- Also, access to a lab and five graduate students, at least three of them Chinese.
- What plan? I'm set for life! Au revoir, suckers!
- And if my calculations are correct, we're all going to die horribly.
- I'll get you, Farnsworth. Even if it takes me another hundred years.
- Ahem. Ladies and Gentlemen. I have placed in orbit a giant mirror that will reflect
  40% of the sun's rays. Thus cooling Earth. Observe.
- Problem solved.
- Uh, so the robots are to blame. As I suspected.  We are left with only one possible
  course of action. Grim though it be.
- We must immediately and permanently shut down, dismantle and destroy all robots!
- Per your orders I have modified my mirror to fire a colossal electromagnetic pulse
  at the Galapogas. Every robot will be instantly and painfully terminated. Now for
  your part of the bargain.
- We missed.
- Ladies and gentlemen, my killbot features Lotus notes and a machine gun. It is the
  finest available.
- No one calls me that. I'm having at you!
WERNSTRUM:
- My God, he needs medical attention!
- Not only do you not deserve a Nobel Prize for loosing this bloated man-ball on the
  world but you are hereby kicked out of the Academy Of Science.
- Young man, you have opened our minds and swayed our hearts. Let us therefore -
- Bender, you were right! Truly you have lived more in your one week of being human
  than the rest of us have in our entire lives.
- And so to recognise your achievements I hereby award you the Nobel Prize......in
  uh......chemistry!
- When did he die?
- But he just said "Woo."
WHALERBOT:
- Bender, hey, Bender! Over here!
- Ooh aah! I died doin' what I loved.
WHALERBOTS:
- (singing) We're whalers on the moon,
- (singing) We're whalers on the moon,
- We're whalers on the -
WHITEY:
- 'The charge is bank robbery. Now, my caddie chauffeur informs me that a bank is
  a place where people put money that isn''t properly invested. Therefore, robbing
  a bank is tantamount to that most heinous of crimes: Theft of money!'
- Yes? What? You say if I testify I'll be killed? Oh. It's for you.
- Ah, the 67th Amendment.
- Counselor, what evidence do you offer to support this new plea of insanity?
- Insanity plea is accepted. Mr. Bender, I hereby commit you to the asylum for criminally
  insane robots until such time as you are deemed cured.
- And, Mr. Fry, I sentence you to the home for criminally insane humans.
- Order! Order! The only poor people I want to hear about are the people who tend
  to my pores at the spa. Just send them both to the robot loony bin and let's go.
- Divorce is final.
- Santa Claus, you stand accused of crimes against humanity. How do you plead?
- Quit badgering the witness!
- Whereas I have a ham dinner with mayonnaise waiting for me at my mansion, I find
  the defendant guilty.  Santa Claus, I hereby sentence you to be executed at sundown.
- So I said to Kitty "The only way to keep the butler from running away is to cut
  off his foot!"  Yes, it reminds me of a joke I heard about upper-middle class people.
- Heck, you're never too rich to enjoy a free turkey dog!
WIGGLES:
- The hell I will! Have you even read the captain's handbook?
- Always respect the chain-o-command - captain.
WOMAN:
- Good afternoon, sir.  Name?
- I'm Leela. Now it's New Year's Eve so I'd like to decide your fate quickly and get
  out of here.
- Feeding time!
- You're from the 20th century? That's incredible! I'm from the 21st century.
- We sure do. Remember when those cyborgs enslaved humanity?
- Mr. Mayor, we just got this transmission from Neptune.
- The transmission cuts out there, sir. No, I, guess it keeps going.
- There we go.
- Could you hold my purse for a minute?
- Dean Vernon, the students from Robot House are here.
- We favour unreasonably huge subsidies to the Brain Slug Planet.
- Attach Brain Slugs to them.
- Oh!
- That's disgusting.
- Move it, man. Come on!
- Give me some of that special sauce.
- Get off!
- Go!
- Mr. Fry, Mama tells us you're quite the oddity; a bachelor at your age.
- Mr. Brainly, what news have you of the London season?
- Eww, gross.
- What's that scribbldy-gook?
- (patronising) That's so good for a person with one eye.
- 'The CIA cafeteria menu for the week of May 15th is as follows: Monday, shepherd''s
  pie. Tu--'
- Who are you?
- My wedding cake!
- You're not stuck.
- Woo! Come on! Throw like a girl!
- Yeah, a role model in how to stink!
- Jackie Anderson. I'm on the blernsball team at NNYU and I was hoping to get to play
  in the majors soon.
- Ow! You broke my foot!
- You're so young in spirit! Its hard to believe you're as old as 25.
- What's happening Hubie?
- Well as long as we're being honest, I also spent my tax refund on a crazy treatment.
- It better for us both to just be ourselves. You, wrinkled as a prune.
- I love you!
- What happened to the food?
- I'll take four!
WOMEN:
- (chanting) Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
YANCY:
- I wanna be named Philip! Me Philip! Me Philip!
- Mine! Mine!
- Yancy drives, he goes up with his patented spacehook!
- You're not the president of it!
- (shouting) I'm dying of old age!
- Lucky.
- Cosmic Y.
- Uh, deep space!
- The spacewalk...
- '...The robot...'
- The zero G!
- You callin' me a biter?
- Stop illin'! Word!
- He's just scratching. No one's ever done more than a quadruple.
- Stop hogging the clover.
- That stupid clover is a worthless piece of garbage! Give it give it give it!
- I'm gonna pile drive you!  You're dead meat!
- Thanks for lending me your tux Dad. It'll be perfect for my wedding.
- Oh that reminds me. I was thinking of rummaging through Phil's records for something
  to play at the wedding.
- Hmm Breakfast Club, this'll clear out the room at the end of the reception.
- Uh, I'm sorta thinking one.  Daddy has a present for you today. Do you know what
  it is?  It's a lucky clover that can help you be successful at anything you do -
  even breakdancing - and it once belonged to someone very special.
- Really?  Son, I'm naming you Philip J. Fry in honour of my little brother, who I
  miss every day. I love you Philip, and I always will.
- Hello first baloney of the new millenium! Ah here he comes. That's him and Seymour.
- He's trying to tell us something. Maybe he can lead us to Philip.
- Should we follow him?
YOKELBOT:
- Get ye to your house, ye ignorant villagers.
- Stop! What are ye doing?
- Ye think me be he?
- Nee. I mean, "no". I was given the curse many a year ago while on a bird-watching
  trip to the Arctic...
- (voice-over) ...I was attacked by a vicious, motorised sled. The natives called
  it the abominable snowmobile.
ZAPP:
- These new uniforms are pretty snappy, eh, first officer?
- Destroy them!  Mmm! That's got a nice feel to it.
- Captain's journal; star date 3000.3.
- You! Aren't you getting this?  We have detected a vessel attempting to break the
  security cordon around Vergon 6. I'm anticipating an all-out tactical dogfight,
  followed by a light dinner...ravioli, ham, sundae bar.
- Not yet, Kif. In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces.  What?
- 'A well-calculated move straight out of Sun Tzu''s classic text The Art Of War,
  or my own masterwork: Zapp Brannigan''s Big Book Of War.  But the one thing their
  captain doesn''t realise and never will is that --'
- Then I have risked all and lost. Kif, old man, I'll be in the escape pod. If that
  wicker chair I like survives the slaughter, have it sent to my P.O. box.
- I'm in command here. Zapp Brannigan. Has my fame preceded me or was I too quick
  for you?
- You're an impressive piece of captain. Beautiful and deadly - a potent combination.
- But I do. I doubt I've seen more than three or four captains sexier than you, and
  only one who was deadlier.
- The Killbots? A trifle! It was simply a matter of outsmarting them.
- You see, Killbots have a preset kill limit. Knowing their weakness, I sent wave
  after wave of my own men at them, until they reached their limit and shutdown. Kif,
  show them the medal I won.
- More, please.  A little more...more...keep going.
- Whatever it is, I'm willing to put wave after wave of men at your disposal. Right
  men?
- Vergon 6?! This light dinner is over.
- The Democratic Order Of Planets prohibits interfering with undeveloped worlds. It's
  a little rule known as "Brannigan's Law".
- Yes, by a Democratic Order Of Planets mining crew.
- I don't pretend to understand Brannigan's Law. I merely enforce it.
- I'm afraid I can't allow that. Guards!
- Kif, follow me up to the observation deck. I've got some musing to do.
- I'm facing a formidable female adversary, Kif. Suggestions?
- You mean Brannigan's Law?
- Which one?
- "Kif, you're my best and most loyal friend but you've earned my contempt once again.\
  \ As my prod\xE9g\xE9 you should know that the only way to deal with a female adversary\
  \ is to seduce her.  This time we are sure she's a woman, right?"
- Good! Invite her to my quarters. Oh, and have the boy lay out my formal shorts.
- You. You lay out my formal shorts.
- Come and get it!
- Welcome to my humble chamber. Or as I call it, "the Love-nasium". Shampagin?
- Well I have studied abroad. Or two!
- Uh-huh?
- Uh-huh?
- Mm-hm.  I like your style. I find it very...(whispering)...erotic.
- (shouting) Erotic!
- You look like a woman who enjoys the finer things. Come over here and feel my velour
  bedspread.
- Leela, it's real velour. Just let yourself go.
- You'd rather sit in prison than spend one evening with the Zapper?
- (crying) Oh, God, I'm pathetic. Sorry. Just go. You want the rest of the shampagin?
- (crying) Oh, God, no!
- (crying) I get so lonely. I just thought you - a fellow captain - would understand.
- (crying) Yeah, it's great ordering people around and stuff but through it all you're
  completely alone.
- (crying) I'm just so lonely!
- Good morning, lover.
- Now you're officially my woman. Kudos! I can't say I don't envy you.
- A sexy mistake.
- A split second is all it takes. That's why sooner or later you'll come crawling
  back to the Zapper.
- Leela, you're obviously confused and aroused.
- Go ahead. I won't stop you.
- We both know you won't make it halfway to Vergon 6 before the craving sets in. Then
  you'll come crawling back for another taste of sweet, sweet candy...Bam!
- Kif!
- I have made it with a woman. Inform the men.
- Y'know, Kif, once my woman returns I won't have much time to hang out with the boys
  anymore.
- So let's make the most of our time together, shall we?  Never mind. Just give me
  a back rub.
- And that's why you'll never make captain, Kif.  Hmmm.
- Well, well, well!
- So, crawling back to the Big Z like a bird on its belly. Delicious.
- They've been known to.
- Can't you ask a little more...sexfully?
- 'Certainly. But first you''ll have to get rid of that thing.  That''s the law, Leela.
  And Brannigan''s Law is like Brannigan''s love: hard and fast!...'
- '...Now put that greasy rat outside and we''ll tow you to safety.'
- And which one rocked your world?
- Captain's journal; star date...uh...
- April 13th...point two.
- We have failed to uphold Brannigan's Law. However, I did make it with a hot alien
  babe. And in the end is that not what man has dreamt of since first he looked up
  at the stars? Kif, I'm asking you a question!
- She's a beautiful ship alright. Shapely, seductive. I'm gonna fly her brains out.  And
  now, without further adieu, I christen this ship, Titanic.
- Well, well, well! The Lady Leela. Take notes, Kif. You're about to witness the subtle
  waltz known as seduction. So, trapped on a ship with me. What say you and I knock
  some very sensual boots?
- Captain's inspection!
- Kif, I'm feeling the captain's itch.
- No, the itch for adventure! Prepare to change course.
- That's for schoolgirls! Now here's a route with some chest hair.
- "Yes, comets! The icebergs of the sky. By jackknifing from one to the next at breakneck\
  \ speed we might just get some kind of gravity boost ... or something. It's time\
  \ to shove a jalape\xF1o up this ship's tailpipe.  Divert power from the shields,\
  \ full speed ahead!"
- Leela, perhaps this is an awkward time but if things don't work out with this pipsqueak
  here ...  ... I just want you to know I'll be there to score you on the rebound.
- Your attention, please. As captain of this vessel, the terrible burden of naming
  a limbo contest winner is mine and mine alone.
- And the winner is, Leela!
- No matter. I know from personal experience how horizontal you can get. As your reward,
  you and that hairpile are invited to dine at the captain's table this evening.
- I like your style, Fry. You remind me of a young me. Not much younger, mind you.
  Perhaps even a couple of years older.
- As a gentleman, I must warn you. If you so much as glance at another woman, I'll
  be all over Leela like a fly on a pile of very seductive manure.
- Ah, the family Wong. Our party is complete.
- I'd like to impose a toast on the happy couple. Down the hatch!
- Yes, Fry. Plant one on your woman.
- No.
- Come back when it's a catasrophe.  Oh, very well.
- No.
- 'Kif, old friend, I don''t know which disgusts me more: Your cowardice or your stupidity!
  We''ll simply set a new course for that empty region over there. Near that black-ish
  hole-ish thing.'
- Don't blame yourself, Kif. We were doomed from the start. Nothing remains now but
  for the captain to go down with his ship.
- No, it's noble of you, Kif!  As of now ...  ... you're in command. Congratulations,
  captain!
- Call me cocky, but if there's an alien out there I can't kill, I haven't met him
  and killed him yet. But I can't go it alone.  That's why I'm ordering every available
  ship to report for duty. Anyone without a ship should secure a weapon and fire wildly
  into the air.
- Since this is an emergency all robots will now have their patriotism circuits activated.
- We're all from different cultures here. Some of you are white, some of you are black.  You're
  brown.  And you're silver. But I don't care if your skin's red or tan or Chinese.
  You're all going to have to learn to die together.  Am I right, soldier?
- 'Remember, our mission is simple: Destroy all aliens!'
- Oh, yes, right. Nobody destroy Kif ... (quietly) unless you have to.  (talking)
  Oh ho ho! The luscious Captain Leela. This is turning into one very sex-ay struggle
  for the future of the human race!
- Right, right. Nobody destroy Leela either.
- The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well-made bed. You will practise
  until you can make your bed in your sleep.
- You won't have time for sleeping, soldier. Not with all the bed-making you'll be
  doing.
- The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye the rest of the
  dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.  Now, like all great plans,
  my strategy is so simple an idiot could have devised it. On my command all ships
  will line up and file directly into the alien death cannons, clogging them with
  wreckage.
- You're a brave robot, son. But when I'm in command every mission's a suicide mission.
  Which reminds me.  Leela, perhaps before we head into battle you'd like to make
  love to me, in case one of us doesn't come back.
- Here's hoping.
- Good work, everyone. The mothership is destroyed.
- What the hell is that thing?
- Then what did we just blow up?
- (shouting) Stop exploding, you cowards!
- (shouting) Here he is! Come and get him!
- (simultaneously) Huh?
- That was McNeal.
- (sexfully) Really?
- Maybe that's just her excuse for being incompetent.
- I hate these filthy Neutrals, Kif. With enemies you know where they stand but with
  Neutrals, who knows? It sickens me.  Halt.  Why, Leela. I do believe we've met.
- Then you're under arrest.
- How do I know these scissors aren't part of some Neutral plot?
- The Yarn People of Nylar 4?  So, a plan to assassinate a weird-looking alien with
  scissors. How very Neutral of you.
- 'It was almost the perfect crime, but you forgot one thing: Rock crushes scissors
  ... but paper covers rock ... and scissors cut paper. Kif, we have a conundrum.
  Search them for paper, and bring me a rock.'
- So beautiful, yet so neutral.  Drag them to the ship.
- What makes a man turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with
  a heart full of neutrality?
- No matter. I'll simply cut it from here with the ships laser.
- Kif, if there's one thing I don't need it's your I-don't-think-that's-wise attitude.
- Whoopsie-daisy.
- Absolutely 99% not guilty.
- I'd like to cross-examine the witness.
- We've met before have we not?
- And on that occasion, did you have sex with someone? May I remind you you are still
  under oath.
- Please point out the person in this courtroom you had sex with.  And his name is?
- The very same Zapp Brannigan who did not blow up DOOP headquarters. I rest my case.
- I'd like to make one final statement. Kif c'mere and hold up the flag.  And wave
  it a little for God's sakes. My friends, you can take away a man's title and his
  uniform but you can never take away his integrity or his honour. Plus it was mostly
  Kif's fault.
- One day a man has everything, the next day he blows up a $400 billion space station
  and the next day he has nothing. It makes you think.
- Come, Kif, it's time to begin our life as civilians.  That's an order, soldier.
- Leela, I didn't know where else to turn. You're the only woman who ever loved me.
- I mean physically.
- Just let me work for a little food. Perhaps I could paint a fence, or service you
  sexually, or mop the floors.
- Kif might.
- Just a broken-down hobo who's hit rock-bottom. And his commanding officer.
- So, this Leela. I know she's a very sensuous woman but what manner of captain is
  she?
- I see. Does she by any chance give the crewmembers spankings?
- Good, good. But should she ever institute some sort of bare-bottom spanking policy
  let me go in your place. I won't have my comrades harmed.
- Here's to us poor schmoes working for the man. Even if he is a hot, sexy, female
  man.
- That's using the old noodle!
- Come on, girdle. Hold!
- 'Let me ask you a serious question, Leela: Does the company that made your bra make
  a girdle as well? I ask because a friend of mine--'
- Y'know boys, a good captain needs many skills, such as boldness, daring and a velour
  uniform. And I'm not convinced Leela has any of those things.
- Back when I was captain all I asked from my men was their complete loyalty. If I
  had that, then for all I cared they could sit around the whole day drinking beer
  in their underpants.
- Leela, you might be a formidible do-er of the nasty but I am forced to relieve you
  of your post.
- Failure to prevent a mutiny. Throw her in the brig.
- Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the
  brig".
- Back in my old uniform, and it nearly still fits. Even after all that fattening
  hobo cuisine.
- Take them to the laundry-brig.  So, do I have your loyalty, men?
- That's not nearly loyal enough. I order you to sit around and drink beer until you're
  as loyal as Kif here.
- No. You're loyal enough already. Meanwhile, I have a plan. We will single-handedly
  attack our archenemy the Neutral Planet.
- Once the neutral war machine lies in ruins, I'll be a hero again and the DOOP will
  reinstate me as captain.
- Maybe not to you, Kif, but if I recall correctly, you were court-martialed in disgrace.
- Prepare to continue the epic struggle between good and neutral.
- Precisely. Now, in the name of all that is good and honourable, we'll call the Neutral
  President with a message of peace, then blast him.
- Fly the white flag of war.
- This is Zapp Brannigan of the good ship ... Planet Express Ship. I come swinging
  the olive branch of peace.
- Now we crash the ship into their headquarters, killing them in a hellish firestorm
  from which no living thing can escape.
- Then your mission is complete. I, meanwhile, will have ejected to safety, wearing
  the only spacesuit on board.
- Of course. What do you think I meant by "loyalty"? Now help me into the only spacesuit.
  It looks a bit sweaty in there so you may need to apply baby powder.
- So it's mutiny is it? I never thought I'd see the day. Come, Kif, let's eject. I
  found a children's spacesuit you can wear.
- And so, when Captain Leela panicked, perhaps distracted by female troubles, my quick
  thinking allowed me to do whatever I did to save the day.
- Come, Kif, we've got work to do.
- Uh, Smith! Zapp Smith. Uh, Brannigan.
- Let's see ... Oh, yes!  Yes, definitely. Oh, I'd like some of that.  Mmm, I'll just
  have everything on the menu.
- (sexfully) Hello!
- Cheers!
- Baby, wait! You didn't show me your surprise.
- And the winner is...
- Huh? Leela?
- Wait. What are you people, idiots? I'm still going mano a mano with this envelope.
  Miss Vega 4.  (singing) There it is, Miss Universe. There it is, looking weird.
- Boo!
- As chief negotiator, I speak for all of Earth when I mourn the regrettable loss
  of the Omicronian young. We share your pain.  Mmm.  If we could undo the damage...
  These would be great with quack-a-mole.
- Alright, I'm putting them away.  Now, uh, what is it you want?
- Fair enough. How many is that?
- 'A though occurs: There aren''t that many humans.'
- Hmm. 198 billion babies in a few weeks. We'll need an army of super-virile men scoring
  'round the clock! I'll do my part. Kif, clear my schedule.
- My fellow Earthlings, we have reached an agreement. Using the twin guns of grace
  and tact, I blasted our worthless enemies with a fair compromise.  They will not
  eat everyone on Earth.
- Instead, they will eat only a single human of their choice.
- Leela, my sweet, I've come to save you. I have a devious plan!
- Wingus? Dingus? Listen up. We're gonna give the aliens the old switcheroo!
- Correct. I found a giant hideous ape that looks exactly like Leela.
- Don't worry. Kif is an expert stylist, as you can plainly see.  Mmm!
- True. At the negotiations, they thought Kif here was the statesman and I was a jabbering
  mental patient. Isn't that right, Kif?
- I'm seeing double!
- '(whispering) People of Earth: Shh!'
- Why'd you open your bong hole you smelly hippie? You'd sacrifice a beautiful woman
  to save a moderately-attractive monkey? You must've smoked some bad granola.
- I'll never tell.
- I'll get her for you.
- I realise this may hurt our chances of consummating our relationship again.
- Uh--
- Sorry, but the army's instituted a men-only policy.
- It's shameful, I agree. In the olden days, I proudly fought alongside female troops,
  shoulder to, uh, shoulder. Alas, after a series of deadly blunders caused by distracting
  low-cut fatigues and lots of harmless pinching, the army decided women weren't fit
  for service. Not when I'm in charge.
- If it's a lesson in love, watch out. I suffer from a very sexy learning disability.
  What do I call it, Kif?
- Men, you're lucky men. Soon you'll all be fighting for your planet. Many of you
  will be dying for your planet. A few of you will be forced through a fine mesh screen
  for your planet. They will be the luckiest of all.
- Now to present the logistics of our mission, the Commander-in-Chief. Please welcome
  the original Gerber Baby, Earth President Richard M. Nixon.
- It's a desolate, ugly little planet with absolutely no natural resources or strategic
  value. Questions?
- Don't ask me, you're the one who's going to be dying.
- 'A valid question.  We know nothing about their language, their history or what
  they look like. But we can assume this: They stand for everything we don''t stand
  for. Also, they told me you guys look like dorks.'
- What's the matter, private? Tent got your tongue? (chuckling) Tent got your... (talking)
  Kif, write that down and send it to Humour In Uniform.
- Yes. He edged out my old mark by two seconds......and 16 minutes...and 12 hours.
  I do plan to finish someday, Kif. Good hustle, soldier.
- As a bubbling Crock-Pot of male hormones, I sure do. What's your name, private?
- Lemon, you're a man's man. You're a man's man's man. More importantly, your hand,
  while firm and masculine, is soft as a velvet child. What lotion do you use?
- Roger that. Kif, get me ten cases of Pert and Popular.
- Squirt it on some homeless man with dry elbows.  Private Lee Lemon may well be the
  finest recruit I've seen in all my years of service. That young man fills me with
  hope and some other emotions that are weird and deeply confusing to me.
- (sexfully) Hello!
- Uh-huh, uh-huh. That's whatever you were talking about for you.
- (shouting) Ten hut!  Well, well, well. If it isn't Lee Lemon. The flaming star of
  Brannigan's Rough Rangers. Say, uh, Lemon, do you like to read? I just got a great
  book on tape. It's about life in ancient Greece and --
- Shh. Don't talk. Just go.
- And now for the battle plan. As you all know, the key to victory is the element
  of surprise. Surprise!
- Watch where you're shooting, private. You spooked Felicity.  There, there, boy.
- Look at this sissy, Kif. While others were fighting and dying pointlessly, he was
  hiding in a hole, wallowing in a pool of his own cowardice.
- I'm depromoting you, soldier. Kif, what's the most humiliating job there is?
- Wrong! Being your assistant! Private Fry, you will henceforth serve as Kif's assistant.
- Here lies the bravest soldier I've seen since my mirror got grease on it. I hereby
  order that in Bender's honour, he be melted down and made into a statue of himself.
- Ah! Pre-war scotch!  Welcome, Lieutenant Bender. You're looking sharp.
- Damnit, Kif, where's the little umbrella? That's what makes it a scotch-on-the-rocks!
- Make me a new one.
- You'll be negotiating with the aliens' mysterious leaders, the Brain Balls. They've
  got a lot of brains and they've got a lot of cutzpa!
- A little lower. Lower. Lower. A lot lower. Too low...! Lower!
- Private Lemon, no need to leave.  My stall just became free.
- Right. Right!  I'm about to try the new lotion you recommended. (sexfully) If I
  should accidentally put too much on my hands, perhaps I could rub it onto you.
- Hm?
- Uh, sorry, Mr. President, I didn't realise. Kif, raise him up about nipple-high.
- The one we had the doctors implant in that gullible Bender robot.
- Hm?
- Come along, Lemon before this whole dump blows up.
- Of course, my significant soldier. The bomb is voice activated. It will detonate
  the instant the robot unwittingly speaks a certain word.
- 'It''s the one word the robot uses more than any other. We got it from this convenient
  database of his 10 most frequently-used words.  Number 10, chump; number nine, chumpette;
  number eight, yours; number seven, up; number six, pimpmobile; number five, bite;
  number four, my......number three, shiny; number two, daffodil. And Bender''s number
  one most frequently uttered word, the word which, if uttered, will blow up this
  entire planet: Ass.'
- Lee? When will I see you again?  The two of you are good friends? But I thought
  we would be good friends. (contemptuous) Well, let's see how friendly you get when
  you're sharing a prison cell!
- Leela!
- So it's you I've been attracted to! Oh, God, I've never been so happy to be beaten
  up by a woman.
- Kif, I'm headed to the men's room and I'll be needing an attendant so-- Oh, I'm
  sorry. You're crying like a woman. It's alright. I've always thought myself as a
  father figure to some of my more pathetic men. Kif, old friend, let's rap.
- (laughing) Oh, that's rich! (talking) Go on.
- (voice-over; proud) Yes! It was in all the papers.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh. Mm-hmm, uh-huh.
- Belay that remark!  Your Amy knows my Leela? I have formed an idea!
- I'm calling to negotiate a double date. You and me, Kif and Amy.
- Then let the negotiations begin. I propose we go out on 10 dates.
- Nine.
- Seven.
- Eight?
- Five, and that's my final offer ... four.
- Two.
- I'll take it.
- We'll meet you tonight for part of dinner and the first half of a movie.
- Here's my personal book of pickup lines. Say as many of them as you can as fast
  as you can. Don't stop for any reason.
- Wrong, wrong, wrong! And what's that? Candy? Candy's for dorks! Give me that. Mmm!
- Hello, beautiful. I got these for you.
- Well, well. This looks to be one disturbingly erotic date.
- Waiter, bring us a bottle of wine.
- And some oysters on the half-shell.
- Kif's not hungry. (quietly) Kif, this place is expensive. (talking) I'd like two
  steaks and the ladies will have some very sensual salads -- with low-cal sensual
  dressing.
- There's only one sure-fire way back into a woman's heart and parts beyond. I speak
  of course, of kareoke.
- Amateur hour's over.  Let me show you why they call me "The Velour Fog"! Hit it!
- (spoken-word) She walked up to me and she asked me to dance,
- No need. There's not a restaurant built I can't fly. Where to, ladies?
- Let's see what this eatery can do.
- Ah, she's built like a steakhouse, but she handles like a bistro.  She's out of
  control!
- (from inside) You win again, gravity!
- (mumbling) I 'unno. (talking) This whole sector is uncharted.
- Well, nothing to do now but repopulate the human race.  Just me and you!  (whispering)
  And maybe you.
- Well, hello! I usually don't say this but you are the most beautiful trio of gigantic
  ladies I've ever laid eyes on.  (reading) I find the most erotic part of a woman
  is the boo--
- (laughing) Oh, God, you're killing me! Ow! God, you're killing me!
- Yes! A little tighter.  Tighter. Perhaps a hard spanking is in order?  Too hard!
- Just FYI, I could be used for snu-snu.
- Oh, thank you, Lord in heaven!
- (cheering) Yeah!  (talking) What are you, gay?
- Baby, it'll blow your mind.
- (from inside) Oh, baby!
- (gasping) We need rest. The spirit is willing but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
- I had snu-snu!
- Now that's a wave of destruction that's easy on the eyes.
- 'Now, remember, Kif: The quickest way to a girl''s bed is through her parents. Have
  sex with them and you''re in.'
- Well that's natural. After all you're meek and uninteresting. Until now you've gotten
  by on my left-over charisma, scrounging off it like a tiny charisma parasite.
- And why wouldn't they? Yes, yes, I know. Tiny, meek, uninteresting. Spare me your
  tedious life story, Kif. And above all have fun!
- I am the man with no name. Zapp Brannigan, at your service!
- Very well. I'll clean up Kif's mess. I shall go bargain with the Martian's personally.  Your
  gasps intrigue me. Explain.
- I didn't realise you were bringing your girlfriend, lieutenant!
- Did I say "girlfriend"? She sounds more like a wife!
- 'Behold: The Great Stone Face of Mars.'
- The only known entrance to the Martian reservation.
- Well, yeah, but it's way over the other side of the planet.
- Nose-ward, ho!
- Take me to your leader.
- 'We come to negotiate the release of Amy Wong. And just to clarify: Land is the
  stuff that has sky over it.'
- How do we even know she's alive?
- Sh! You're weakening our bargaining position. How about instead you give us the
  girl and we carve a bunch of our presidents into your sacred mountain?
- Chief, my people are a people of law. And that law is ...  ... no backsies!
- Oh, boy!
- Kroker, that was one Brannigan-esque feat of heroism!
- Don't be such a chicken, Kif. Teenagers all smoke and they seem pretty on the ball.
- Yes, sir!
- Please, you give me too little credit.
- Quiet, you! This court martial is now in session. The honourably sexy Zapp Brannigan
  residing. Bring in the accused.
- Philip J. Fry, you stand accused of travelling to the forbidden planet Omega 3,
  a crime punishable by 12 concurrent death sentences. Do you understand the charges?
- '"Yes". So noted. Do you plead guilty? Double "yes". Guilty! I will now carry out
  the punishment. Kif, my gun.'
- Order!  Order in the court! Very well then, Mr. Fry. Please recount the events that
  led you to be guilty.
- The court is intrigued. Perhaps we could hear more about these forbidden words from
  someone with a sexilly seductive voice.
- You mean after the vast migration of Star Wars fans?
- I've never heard of such a brutal and shocking injustice that I cared so little
  about. Next witness.
- Please use the beeps.
- This court will now hear some very sensual testimony from this court's ex-lover,
  Turanga Leela.
- So Melllvar ordered a battle to the death. I assume no one survived.
- You're under arrest. Prepare to be boarded.
- So I boarded you, eh. What happened next?
- Happy Freedom Day, ladies!  Come on, let loose and show me something!  Anything.
  Seriously, I'd take an armpit.  Oh, yeah! Thank you, Linda!
- 'Remember, men: Take him alive so there''s something left to kill.'
- Yeah? Well what are you going to do about it, Shrimp-y?
- Ready? Retreat!
- Alright, Kif, let's show these freaks what a bloated, runaway military budget can
  do. Bring me the activation codes for our global defence network.
- We can't be too careful with these codes. Rumour has it a double agent may be aboard
  this very ship.  I'm watching you! You, ensign? What's your name?
- Hugh Man? Now that's a name I can trust. Run down to the central battle computer
  and enter these codes. Chop, chop!
- You're damn right there is! That strapping young lad's gunning for your job. And
  he just might get it.
- The enemy approacheth! Lieutenant, fire missile one and recommend me for another
  medal. Make it gaudy, I'm going clubbing later.  Tick, tock!
- Well, Kif, stand by to take the blame. Steady, steady ... now!
- Yeah? Well good luck, sister. All our modern technology is useless.
- Well well well! Do my eyes believe me or is that my bosomy swan, Leela?
- They jump right out of their pants! Oh what now? Activate glass window. Kif, I'm
  sensing a very sensual disturbance in the force. Prepare for ship-to-ship intimacy!
- How 'bout I help you finish that dream you were having about me?
- Uh, let's try that a little lower and a lot softer!
- Damn. The last time that happened I got slapped with three paternity suits. Listen
  up history's greatest villains......Get back into the Holo-Shed before I start blasting!
- Spare me your space-age technobabble Atilla The Hun!
- After all that I could use some relaxation. I'll be in the Holo-Shed.
- Look, I'm sure we're all a little unclear on how anyone gets pregnant. So Kif, pray
  explain. And don't spare the dirty words where appropriate.
- You disgust me! Go on.
- Ah, my home away from home. By the way Kif, your flush seemed to be set on stun,
  not kill.
- Leela! How could you? Our love has had to endure your constant hatred and now this?
  (crying) Stop testing our love!
- So the toilet seat is like the uncle or something?
- Yes I wonder what we got you.
- Smells like a jockstrap.
- Nice work!
- The Spiderians, though weak and woman-like on the battlefield, are masters of the
  textile arts. Taste like king crab by the way. Crazy bugs actually wove this tapestry
  of my heroic conquest while I was still killing them!
- Exactly $1 billion!
- Leela! My precious rock tub! I'll save you!
- Bray-vo! Enn-core!
ZOID:
- (reading) I beg of you, Mr. Funny Uncle, teach me the comedy business. Sincerely,
  Zoidberg. (talking) Oy, isn't that nice? He took the time.
- This is a fan letter from my rich doctor nephew who just might be my ticket out
  of this flophouse, he might.  Yeah, you'd better run.  (writing) Dear Rich Doctor
  Nephew, I can help you be funny. The first funny thing you must do is put all of
  your money in the form of a cashier's cheque and come to Hollywood.
- 'Rich nephew, come over here and give your uncle a nice, big meal.  So, here we
  are: A still-famous film comedian...'
- Eating real food in a restaurant, as we both often do. So, you want to be a comedian,
  is it?
- (shouting) Well that dream dies now. You're unfunny and untalented. That's why you're
  perfect for drama.
- I'm putting together a big drama picture right now, as we speak. The script is dynamite.
  I know because I wrote it myself. And with me directing and starring, I'll be back
  on top after 50 miserable years......uh, of fame.
- This fame film has a juicy part for you, if you completely finance it with your
  doctor money. So, are you in?
- Oh, not much, not much, (quietly) amilliondollars. (talking) Then it's settled.
  Another blockbuster Hollywood deal.
- 'Thank you. A more classic movie plot there isn''t: A son who does not want to follow
  in his father''s business. And that business is being president of Earth, no less.
  The son, as it happens, is vice president.'
- Now, remember, and I can't stress this enough, this is a talkie. So I want the full
  gamut of emotions from every actor in every scene.
- And, action!
- 'Cut! Cut! Cut it!  I said this is a talkie, damnit! You''ve got to emote more!
  And you extras: Wave your arms and make faces. What is this, a morgue?'
- Action. And I mean circus-grade action.
- Cut, cut, cut it!  Would you show a little emotion?  People, people, please. Just
  because it's a dramatic scene, doesn't mean you can't do a little comedy in the
  background.  Throw a pie or two, for God's sake.
- Cut, cut it! Eck! Look, look, it's alright, kid. We'll, uh, we'll get it in editing.
  Alright, that's a wrap everybody, I'm gonna see you all at the premiere which, by
  the way, when is?
- (in movie) No! My son will not shame me like this. I would sooner die, I would!
- (in movie) Oy!
- Oy, now he emotes!
- How 'bout we rig the awards?
- No, I'm not. I'm an even bigger liar than you. My career went down the tube the
  day they invented smell-a-vision.
- Oy. All I wanted was for people to think of me one last time before I die.
- As a pathetic has-been, they remember me. As a forgotten relic, they remember me.
  Bah! It's better to die now.
- I'm a seat-filler, Joan's head. My only marketable skill is to occupy space.
- Hooray, I won't be murdered. I'll live another day. Another day of...pathetic, forgotten
  misery.
- Thank you. Thank you so much! You know, through all my ups and downs, I always thought
  the most important thing in life was to win an Oscar. But tonight I realise what's
  really important is to win two Oscars. Ha, ha! I'm kidding, I'm kidding. What really
  matters in life is that people care about you, whether it's a whole crowd......or
  just one die-hard fan.
- Thank you, nephew.  Now I can die happy. 10 seconds from now, when Calculon kills
  us.
- Here, enjoy. What are you getting upset? It's slightly less fraudulent for you to
  have it.
- Let the earth quake, I've got somebody's Oscar!
ZOIDBERG:
- Excellent, excellent!
- Now open your mouth and let's have a look at that brain.  No no no no no not that
  mouth!
- Really?
- Young lady, I'm an expert on humans. Now pick a mouth, open it and say... What?
  My mother was a saint! Get out!
- Thank you, I made them myself.
- Goodbye.
- The female Leela's problem is purely medical. Soon she will drop her eggs and they
  will hatch and all will be well.
- The rotting carcass of a whale.
- I'd like a jumbo squid log, please.
- Alright, alright. Let me have one of your young on a roll.
- Fine! Just give me something crawling with parasites.
- Yes, please, popcorn!
- (defensively) I'm not on trial here.
- Stop! Stop! I admit it! My people ate them all! We kept saying "One more can't hurt"
  and then they were gone. We're sorry!
- That stench. That heavenly stench! More!
- More! More! More! More!
- Alright.
- Uh-oh, I shouldn't have had seconds.
- They are mild. In fact, you're soaking in one right now.
- A fancy dress gala! I'll wear my formal shell.
- Yeah, I know.
- Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in a high-speed centrifuge separating out the denser
  fluid of His Highness.
- Oh, right, right, with the bones! I always forget about the bones.
- Let's face it, we're in hot butter here. We should call Leela for help.
- Of course! Why didn't I think of that!
- I'll handle this!
- Me?
- In fact, that's why we loved you.
- This is a witch hunt!
- Oh, yeah.
- You know Zapp Brannigan?
- Aha!
- I've had it with this game! I'm going for a scuttle!
- Uh-oh.  Help! Help!  Bender, you gotta spring me. I'll never survive in here; I'm
  too pretty!
- Yay!
- I could make the costumes.
- Gracias.  Single Female Lawyer, where were you on the night of August 23rd?
- Aha!
- (reading; unmoved) My God, he's dead.
- (cheering) Hooray!
- I'll have a look, but I remind you, I'm an expert on humans not robots.
- Really? I though you were the robot.
- Alright, alright, spare me your life story.  Now what seems to be the trouble?
- 'Hmm. Don''t worry, you''ll be fine.  (muttering) Oh boy. (quietly) I didn''t have
  the heart to tell him: It''s fin fungus. He''ll be floating upside-down by morning.'
- Do you have any that aren't so tight around the thorax?
- (simultaneously) Whammy-wazzle!
- (reluctant) Alright, I'm coming.
- He's so talented!
- That's me, baby!
- They're hideous!
- You know, Fry, you could join a third party, maybe.
- Really? I'd better keep an eye out at the next meeting.
- Sure, humans are cute, but how else are we supposed to test cosmetics?
- We can only hope!
- At least you're not cold blooded!
- You, a bobsledder? That I'd like to see!
- Huh? What's this?  A card from my cousin Zoidfarb.  Instead of "Claus" he writes
  "Claws"! Now that's humorous. Today's comedians could learn from this card.
- So what's the problem? Just get down on your claws and do the apology dance.
- Why?
- 'Amy, this is for you: A set of combs for your beautiful hair.'
- Thank you. These'll come in handy for my new hair.  Finally I look as pretty as
  I feel!
- A pogo-stick!
- Aha!
- The gymnasium? Excellent, excellent. For some reason I'm frisky as a squid on Tuesday.
- We crustaceans don't like steam. I'm going to go work out with the Nautilus!
- Yo, yo, yo! Whassup whassup! Give up the rock!
- Give me that.  More weight!
- Enough with the questions. More weight! More!  More!
- I'm a doctor!
- I am normal. (sexfully) Amy, take of these rubber bands and I'll show you how normal
  I am!
- Ah, much better. You can take off these rubber bands now.
- Give it to me straight, Professor. Is it fin rot? It's fin rot, isn't it? Tell me
  it's not fin rot!
- Excellent, excellent!
- You didn't have to call attention to his speech impediment.
- I'm feeling less nuts, thank you, because tomorrow I will be depositing my jelly
  in the cloacal vents of a female. (sexfully) If you catch my drift.
- I don't know yet. But I shall attract one this afternoon with an erotic display.
- Love? That word is unknown here. I'm simply looking for a female swollen with eggs
  to accept my genetic material.
- Ah, my old scuttling grounds! Let's pull over.
- I used to hang out here as a larva. It looked so much bigger back then. Who's the
  tough guy now, Vinnie?
- No, it's the ceremony of Claw-Plach, where my species fight to the death over matters
  of honour. Also whether abbreviations count in Scrabble. (angry) They don't!
- 'Same place as your species: The beach.'
- How do I look?
- Then the illusion is complete.
- Perfect! This oughta make me stand out. Craw!
- Craw!
- Craw?!
- Craw!
- Cra-- Oh, what's the point?
- Edna?! Edna, it's me, Zoidberg. Remember? From high school?  You used to laugh at
  me because my face was covered with barnacles!
- I've performed a few mercy killings. So, as long as I'm in town I was wondering
  if maybe ... craw?
- Or maybe a doctor?
- (crying) No one will ever want to mate with me, not with a puny claw like this.
  Did you see those other guys? They looked like giant claws with bodies attached.
- (crying) You're right, my stink gland is weak. Smell!
- Hmm, this "love" intrigues me. Teach me to fake it.
- Ask her to mate with me.
- But she's not. She's merely the female with the largest clutch of eggs.
- Then mating.
- Is desire to mate a feeling?
- It's all so complicated with the flowers and the romance and the lies upon lies.
- What? Now there's a bird involved?
- (shouting) I have no idea.
- (shouting) I just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating. (whispering) Fry,
  that doesn't make sense.
- (shouting) You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from internal parasites?
- Why would I wanna know?
- (shouting) How was your day?
- Fry, look what you did, she won't shut up.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.
- Do I ask her to mate now?
- (reading) I'd like to propose a toast to ... coat check number 84.
- Oh, Edna! (reading) Of all the slimy, gross crab monsters on this planet, you are
  apparently the hottest.
- I'm confused, Fry. I'm feeling a strange new emotion. Is it love when you care about
  a female for reasons beyond mating?
- Edna, I couldn't stand it any longer. I--  (angry) Fry!
- (angry) Her caviar is on your neck!
- (angry) Fry!  I challenge you to Claw-Plach!
- A fight to the death.
- Get ready, Fry. I'm going to rip your swim bladder out and show it to you.
- (shouting) Of course I'm being irrational! I'm in love!
- 'Fry, it''s been years since medical school so remind me: Disembowelling in your
  species - Fatal or non-fatal?'
- Large bet on myself in round one!
- I choose my own claws! I want the tactile pleasure of chopping him right here in
  the gonads!
- Huh?
- Edna? Honey?
- Edna?
- The frenzy!  Oh, the greatest experience in life and I missed it.
- The frenzy is over. How will I ever get rid of my male jelly now?
- They come to feast after the frenzy. Once my species passes on its genes, it dies.
- Yes.
- Well it was nice of you to let me reattach your arm, Fry. Especially after I made
  a complete eel out of myself.
- 'Yes biggie. I learned to feel things I''d never felt before: Love, jealousy, passion
  for disembowling. I owe it all to you.  There! I pronounce the operation a success.'
- I may not know from emotions but when it comes to medicine, forget about it.
- For you, my friend, anything.
- (from ship) Alright, alright, third time's the charm.
- You're both very lucky. I'd pay anything to end my miserable loneliness. If only
  I weren't so desperately poor.
- Stop! Stop! If you interrupt the mating dance the male will become enraged and maul
  us with his fearsome gonad.
- Did someone say something about a free hot meal?
- Mmm, I haven't eaten since Tuesday! Bird eggs, animal slices ...  ... dry woven
  reeds!  All gone! Can I drive?
- Wahoo!
- Ah, I'll just turn the wheel to maximum fastness!
- 'Vroom vroom! And the winner of the big car race is: Hot Rod Zoidberg!'
- Uh-oh. Here, you drive!
- Fry? Are you alright?
- No, no, no, no, no, of course not. Nobody but you. I'm afraid your body was badly
  damaged in the crash.
- That's it over there.  Don't worry, I managed to keep your head alive with some
  quick surgery.
- There.
- Don't worry, Fry, we'll have your body all fixed up in a few days.  Upsy daisy!
- There you are, good as new. Except for your dorsal fin, I'm afraid I couldn't find
  it after the crash.
- If you call that living.
- It's funny because it's poisonous!
- So what is it already?
- Hello!
- What are we going to do there?
- I'm seeing a movie with friends!
- Fellows! Fellows! How about a film we can all enjoy? Planet Of The Clams. It's about
  an upside-down world where lobster is slave to clam.
- Oh, again with the orphanarium!
- What? What's going on here?
- The doctor is in!  The doctor is out.
- Hello!
- Leela, Fry, robot. No matter what it is you're doing tonight, I'm available.
- Bah, big shots. I say let the dice do the talking.
- I can't spell anything with these cards.
- Finally, I have a good claw. See?  Three human females, a number and a king giving
  himself brain surgery.
- No don't hurt him! He's my best friend!
- I recommend the health cure on Spa 5, the sauna planet. Here, read.
- Oh, it's wonderful! I don't know anything about it but they send me a bucket of
  krill for every patient I send.
- Then it's settled. Hermes will relax and Zoidberg will eat! Hurrah!
- She's a hateful monster this Morgan. She scolded and hit me. I tell you she's risking
  my friendship with her.
- It was me, I'm the hero!
- Now it's time for my song! (singing) When I was two there was a tidal wave in -
- Good evening ladies and germs.  That wasn't a joke, I was talking to Dean Streptococcus.  Now
  I'm not saying Professor Farnsworth is old, but if you consider his age he's likely
  to die soon!  Hey Ringo, that was the joke. Oh, it's showtime at the Apollo all
  over again.
- I wouldn't wanna follow that guy!
- If only it'd worked. You could go back and not waste your time on it.
- A successor to the Professor?
- You? The successor? Over my empty shell! The Professor will pick me. Only I have
  his lobster-like tenacity!
- He's horrible!
- No.
- Mmm!
- I lost it...in a volcano.
- Oh.
- Excuse me, if I might be so bold, I'm willing to offer my services as a bait critic.  These
  sardines for example are bland and tasteless.  And these dry, stringy nightcrawlers,
  though juicy ...  ... very very juicy--
- (sexfully) I'm so into you!
- I wasn't wearing it. (ashamed) I was eating it.
- Wait! I'll save us! By cutting the unbreakable diamond filament!  Well, at least
  I'll die with my friends. Hello?
- How are you doing there, Fry?  Glad to hear it.  Aha!
- Yum, yum, yum!  Uh-oh!  Look at me, I'm Dr. Zoidberg, homeowner!
- Careful, Fry, I think that flag might be poisonous.
- Say, robot, old buddy? Could you help me move a couch?
- What is it, Fry?
- Your student loans have been repaid? Then how 'bout lending your old pal Zoidberg
  a few bucks, Mr Millionaire!
- I've got his scent! Over here where the water gets warmer. This way!
- She's right, I mean sure they got the Braves but it's a third-rate symphony.
- You know, Fry, I've got a little place just outside town. You could come visit,
  maybe?
- Well, I guess this is goodbye for me as well.
- No! My home! It burned down!  (crying) How did this happen?
- Hey! I'm trying to sleep in here!
- I don't like the look of this doctor. I bet I've lost more patients than he's even
  treated.
- Nice try little boy. You might have your textbook knowledge and your real diploma
  but I have more skill in my little claw than you have in your whole carapace.
- Sure, butter me up with candy. But it won't work sonny!  (dazed) Why always the
  fighting?
- (dazed) Clack.
- (dazed) Thanks for the help Leela.
- Oh God. I'm coming dowwwn!
- The king crab is to die for! Look, a tiny edible crown!
- They took away my credit card.
- Please don't hit me. I'm brittle.
- Listen to the smart robot.
- I'll handle the snipping. Afterall I do have the proper equipment.
- They're tastier than an unguarded penguin nest. What do you call them?
- No!
- Oh, yeah, why not?
- Call them what you want. I call them a free meal.
- I can't pay.
- Congratulations. I assume Amy is the father.
- Yes, listen to the father.
- Stop!
- Hooray! I'm useful! I'm having a wonderful time!
- Eck.
- Is this what human mating looks like? Because I like it!
- Land robots!
- Ah!
- Let's watch, shall we?
- What's this? Two meals in one week?
- Friends! Help! A guinea pig tricked me!  What?
- So, now Zoidberg is big, huh? That's more like it! Who's intimidating who now, big
  city?  Hello, Mr. Chase Manhattan Bank. Deny my credit card application, will you?  Ah,
  the famed Apollo Theatre. Boo me off stage on open-mike night, huh? I'll show you!
- Tell it to claw.
- Stop!
- Hmm?
- Alright, so you're nonchalant. Quit rubbing our noses in it.
- What?
- Police? Bah! Nosy meddlers! It so happens I have mail order degrees in Murderology
  and Murderonomy.  Zoidberg is afoot!
- Alright, anteater number one, who are you protecting?  Is it anteater number two?  Don't
  stick your tongue out at me. I need a name!  What? How do you spell that?
- Ah, the gang's all here.
- 'Quiet, please. I''ve called you all here to the parlour to watch as I gradually
  solve the crime. One of the people in this room ... is a big murderer!  You see,
  the killer left one fatal clue: This boot print on the Professor''s lab coat.'
- My next clue came at 4.15, when the clock stopped. And another came two hours later
  at 4.15, when I discovered the murdered body of Amy's dead, deceased corpse.
- So, it's just as I suspected all along. The crime is unsolvable!  A letter from
  Bender, my good friend. (reading) Dear Dr. Jerkberg, if you're reading this, I'm
  already dead. The person who killed me was ... was--  My God! It can't be! The murderer,
  it was--
- If that's his pizza, then I'm icy whatever!
- I don't know, but it's infectious!
- Bender, you look awful. I prescribe make-up. Here. It just so happens I have my
  Mary Kay sample case!
- Many people dream of a fresh, new look. And Mary Kay can make those dreams come
  true.
- I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery.  I kid, I kid!
- Scalpel.  Blood bucket.  Priest. Next patient.
- See, this is how it starts. First with he jokes, then comes the heavy stuff.
- I'm afraid he's gone.
- Excuse me, I believe I'm the doctor.
- That's my joke! I'll kill you!
- I'm sorry but we couldn't remove it.
- Enough already!
- This isn't good for Zoidberg!
- Goodbye, friends. I'll miss you.  Good riddance to them. Now Zoidberg is the popular
  one!
- Oh, you know...!
- For one beautiful night, I knew what it was to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet
  honoured.
- There you go, dearies.
- Then good luck, sister.
- Oh the hypochondriac's back. So what is it this time?
- That's normal. Next patient.
- Hmm. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.  Guess again.
- Me next!
- There's no part of that sentence I didn't like.
- Yes.
- Quick! We can escape through that nasal capillary into the sinus.
- I learned it from a decongestant commercial. (echoing) "Soothing action, action,
  action action..."
- Where the food is digested.
- It's good cholesterol but it spreads like bad cholesterol!
- Gumbercules? I love that guy!
- I've heard of that, who said I haven't?!
- Yippie-ki-yay! You'll never guess where I've been!
- Ouch!
- Why with all the crying?  So that's where I left my shell.
- It was starting to get a little cramped in there so I molted, why not? Ah, the fresh
  air feels good!
- So long. I'm off to toss this old shell in the dumpster and maybe pick up those
  potato chips Amy didn't finish yesterday.
- A feast is a feast.
- 'Look what arrived: My new shell catalogue. So let''s try some on already!  Ah!
  Muy macho! Hey, gringos! Here comes El Zoido to ruin your drinking water!'
- You Latins are so hot-blooded!  This one's like a summer guy!
- And that's how I got my new shell. It looks just like the shell I threw out yesterday
  and I found it in the same dumpster, but this one had a live raccoon inside.  Pretty
  good story, eh, Hermes?
- Doy!
- Well, gang, it looks like we have another mystery on our hands.
- My slinky!  My cuddly, little pet slinky!
- J'accuse!
- You've seen me naked?
- There, little friend. Good as new.
- Believe it.
- '"Dog food", you say?'
- Ow!
- Forgive me, my friend.
- What now?
- Zoidy want balloon! Want balloon now! Zoidy want go outside!
- On margin! Zoidy wanna buy on margin!
- Earth. What a planet. On Earth, you enjoy eating a tasty clam. On my planet, clams
  enjoy eating a tasty you.  Maybe I'm not yelling loud enough. (shouting) On Earth,
  everybody is always looking for a giant squid. On my planet -
- So these three parasitic worms bore into a human's head...
- '...and they walk up to the bar and then - uh-oh.  Wait, stop! I''ve got more! (groaning)
  Oh.'
- My whole life I worked on that act. And they hated it.
- But comedy is in my valves. My Uncle Harold was a big Hollywood star back in the
  era of silent holograms.
- (dramatic) This I cannot deny.
- Maybe so, but perhaps if I wrote him and asked for a few hundred pointers...
- This letter has to be very personal, so I'm writing it in my own ink.  (writing;
  thinking) Dear Uncle Zoid, Greetings from your long-lost nephew. Norm and Sam and
  Sadie's boy, remember? ...
- (voice-over) ...Now I am the most important doctor at the delivery company where
  I work. But, sadly, my life is bereft of laughter.
- (reading) Sincerely, Harold Zoid. P.S. Cashier's cheque. (talking) Did you hear
  that? I'm going to Hollywood!
- That's where I'm meeting Uncle Zoid for lunch to discuss my Hollywood dreams. Next
  time you see me, don't be surprised if I've eaten.
- Uncle Zoid, you're looking young enough to be throw back!
- '...And a rich, respected doctor with many surviving patients.'
- It's my lifelong dream.
- Hmm, serious drama. Perhaps it is time to give up comedy.
- Ah, fame. Where do I come in?
- Uh, OK. How much do I have to invest?
- Is bread free?
- We'll split an order.
- (crying) I've only been here a day and already I'm a Hollywood phoney.
- It's a movie.
- Written and Xeroxed.
- Hooray!
- Bender, you said "wink wink" out loud.
- The Magnificent Three. Scene one, take one.
- The Magnificent Three. Scene 10, take 95.
- Well, uh, editing is a long and expensive process but we spent all the money on
  pies, so it'll be ready Friday.
- (in movie) Good morning, Mr. Vice President!
- (in movie) The president is dead. Congratulations, Mr. President.
- But you won this Golden Globe!
- This is where you live? I though you were a big-shot Hollywood movie star.
- What are you talking about? Everybody remembers Harold Zoid!
- No. This is one death Dr. Zoidberg won't be responsible for. Zoidberg away!
- What category are they on?
- That leave Best Soft-Drink Product Placement and then Best Actor. We don't have
  much time.
- 'And the nominees for Best Actor are: Sir Lawrence...... in The Merchant Of Venus,
  Hive Mind Gamma 7X in Bikini Party Summer, the Soda Machine Robot in Bikini Party
  Summer, Mark Jones in How Beige Was My Jacket and, instead of the fifth guy - Calculon,
  for his powerhouse performance in The Magnificent Three.'
- And the winner is... And the winner, instead of any of the nominees, is the legendary
  Harold Zoid!
- Earthquake!
- Ooo, the new one's out!
- (whispering) The captain's table! What an honour!
- Brilliant!
- You can drink with me maybe?
- Then if you'll excuse me I see some ravioli that only has two shoeprints on it.  Three.
- Captain please, have some liquor. You robots need alcohol to function.
- Please sir, I love you like a father!
- All 6000 hulls have been breached!
- They sent us inside for doing an unsatisfactory job.  (sadly) And eating penguin
  eggs.
- Dammit Fry! He may have done wrong, but he's still your captain.
- Such a man. I'd follow him to hell and back I would.
- Captain, I don't think we're on Pluto any longer. In fact, we may have left space
  as we know it.
- (shouting) Stop yelling at me!
- (shouting; from ship) It's been an honour to serve under you sir!
- To hell with your spoiled baby, I need those shoes!
- So the clover is still in the hiding place maybe?
- Wonderful. And while you're under the knife, you could also get an ink pouch to
  help you escape your enemies.
- Be careful with Adlai, Leela, he's a doctor, they're very poor.
- What? When did this happen? You're joking, right?  That's not funny!
- (mesmerised) Totally.
- Damn right!
- No doubt about it.
- Help! I'm under attack!
- Hooray for me! Hooray for Zoidberg!
- Look! Coupons! I can get two oil changes for the price of one! Now if I could only
  afford the one ... and the car. Ah, the years! So many memories, so many strange
  fluids gushing out of patients' bodies--
- You kept track of it all these years!
- Listen to me, Fry. Just because you think you're a robot, doesn't make you a robot.
  After all, I think I'm a doctor but that doesn't make me a doctor. These fancy clothes
  do!
- By a scallop's forelocks! What's with all the beer, Fry?
- Hooray! I'm helping!
- Oh, the fear!
- Bravo!
- A squid?
- Also good.
- It's toe-tapping-ly tragic.
- Poor Bender.
- Oh, I don't know, Fry. I think I'm too poor to follow a band around in a van.
- Bad news, friends. My shell ran.
- Then it was all on purpose. You're lucky to have Zoidberg as a friend. But cross
  me, and I'll turn on you like that.
- Hooray, robot!
- I can't stop. When I eat too much dirt, I get stuff in my throat.
- Eww, you're touching them.
- I am? At last! Recognition!
- Glad you like them. I've been making fine jewellery for years, apparently.
- Play that thing!
- Not if you've lived a life without regret.
- That one grabbed his behindus!
- I hope we all have as much tomorrow at my birth -
- What?
- Hmm.  Hmm.
- Leela, I would be honoured.
- Sorry, you must have been boring me.
- So he's not perfect. You don't wanna end up old and lonely like Zoidberg! You were
  saying?
- He looks radiant!
- Don't be so hard on yourself, Fry. You lost the woman of your dreams, but you still
  have Zoidberg. You all still have Zoidberg.
- (sexfully) Zoidberg!
- I'm a Globetrotter!
- It's funny. You live in the universe, but you never do these things til somebody
  comes to visit.
- Hooray! Finally you're standing up to him.
- Someone in trouble is!
- The real Lucy Liu! The one you can see a movie of in the popcorn stadium!
- Did you see me escaping? I was like -
- Hey what the?
- Looks like you're retaining water.
- Why?
- At least we've got food.
- Hooray!
- Life was bad but now its good forever!
- Oooh my head is spinning.
- Such noises!
- And Zoidberg picks up another piece, the crowd goes wild!!
- Hello!
- So what are you guys doing tonight? I'm up for whatever.
- Not a day goes by I don't ask myself the same question.
- A buffet! Oh if only I had my wallet with me.
- Both good, the important thing is I'm meeting new people.
- Are you coming onto me?
- Hooray!
- Take, I've got four of them.
- Deviled egg?
- Hey don't cut that! I need that to speak!
- The President is gagging on my gas bladder! What an honour!
- There, good as new!
- Oh no! That's my... Gotcha!
- Can't I have a scented bath in peace?
- And I'm his friend Jesus!
- I help those who help themselves.
- Hooray, its just like Mardis Gras!
- Is Bender still missing for a week? Where is he already?
- Pulse...300, liver...failing, cholesterol...40?
- No I mean 40 pounds!
- Mmm, delicious! Just like stale marshmellows! Ooo and a cherry!
- Uh oh!
- One ship is left only.
- Yes.
- And I'm the other guy. Courage. Not enough of it. Need some from whatshisname.
- What do I smell or something?  Oh!
- And why did I have to take a cab?
- All right!
- Nothing, I'm leaving. But if you have extra courage I'd haul it away for you maybe?
- Now world, you put your hands up!
- Uh sorry, I think there's a problem with your upstairs toilet.
- Clothing, delicious clothing!
- Don't mind if I already did. By the way, do you have anymore of this Dom Perignon
  bubble bath? There was only enough to fill the tub halfway.
- (shouting) I broke your television.
- Host-man! Host-woman! I'm having a wonderful time!
- Not bad for a city boy, huh?  By the way, I took the liberty of fertilising your
  caviar.
- (screaming) Nooo!
- Mom! Dad! Don't ask me to choose!
- Aw!
- Ma! Pa! Our precious ranch!
- Captain Brannigan, you're always welcome here at Rancho Zoidberg!
- Money doesn't make good people, no siree!
- (singing) Oh Danny-boy! The pipes, the pipes are calling...!
- (singing) ...From glen to glen and down -
- I'm expressing my sorrow.
- (singing) Oh Danny-boy!
- Hooray, people are paying attention to me!
- I'll not only help you find it, I'll help you do more to it!
- That is so unfair!
- 'Question: Do you have to have been cryogenically frozen to get the free -  You
  didn''t let me finish. I was going to say "to get the free food."'
- Uh excuse me? Which is the one people like to hug?
- It's the end of the line!
- Is it Planet Express master?
- Yes my liege!
- This company's circling the drain I tell you. I'd sell my stock right now for a
  sangwich!
- A complete sangwich?  You got fleeced! I would have settled for a hard roll with
  ketchup inside!
- Oh! I have no shares!  Wait! My sangwich! Has it also appreciated in value?  Please
  oh please!
- You had to drag spines into this!
- Trust me two out of three doesn't cut it!
- Aha! Once again the conservative sangwich-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry
  investor! Oh! I'm ruined.  Why? Why?
- Ohh!
- Oh boy!
- What's the hold-up?
- Sure. Me.
- I know that.  Surrender your mysteries to Zoidberg!  Oh no! Professor will hit me.
  But if Zoidberg fixes it, then perhaps gifts!  Ow, what? Ohh!
- Casual hello, it's me Zoidberg, act naturally.  Ow! Ouch! Get off of me! Stop!
- Aw, I'll never recombobulate this ship! When the Professor finds out, he'll tear
  me a new cloaca!  Wait! What would the robot do?  Frame someone.
- I'm acting astonished.
- Fry you scoundrel!
- (shouting) What have I done?!
- Oh the guilt! The unbearable guilt!
- Wait! Everyone must know. I broke the Professor's bottled ship.  And what is worse,
  I framed my dearest friend Fry! (crying) I can never repay him his ten dollars.
  So I must take the only honourable path. what the killing myself.  Here I go already.  Huh?
- Fry did it!
- Shut your gills!
- Hurry up with the water, I'm steaming in my own shell I am, it's that hot it is!
- Strange. Why would Nixon, an awkward, uncomfortabble man suddenly throw a party?
  One of the most social events imaginable. It's a trap is why! They're going to deactivate
  all the robots! I don't hear any gasping.
- Ohh!
- I was all in this part! Its magic!
- Stop!
- A little land mammal!
- Oh!
- Stop!
- You didn't do anything. Don't beat yourself up.
- What's going on? Is this angry yelling or busted hearing aid yelling?
- Hello!
- There but for the grace of God.
- (singing) Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
- There's nothing crazy about it. It's just Freedom Day!
- No, it's a fabulous, crab-ulous day!
- 'Then consider the following lecture a bonus: On Earth, freedom is a given. But
  on my planet, we have to suffer for it.'
- That's why I love Earth! You can do what you want, and no-one makes you feel guilty
  because no-one cares.
- That's what I'm talking about!
- I'm swelling with patriotic mucus!
- Yes, fellow patriots, I ate your flag. And I did it with pride. For to express oneself
  with doing a thing is the very essence of Freedom Day! Bless this planet and all
  its wonderful people!
- I'm all scuttled out!  Huh? My planet's embassy? They're paid to not kill me! A-yoop!
- I thought I understood this world. I thought I was fitting in. But I guess I don't
  belong on here anymore than I belong on our crappy home planet-- Ooh, sorry.
- Ambassador Moivin, you and your staff are so kind. I'm truly humbled.  What, no
  marshmallows?
- Aha! Now the rubber band's on the other claw!
- Deny my freedom, will you? Well we'll do to you what we did to the Squash Men of
  the Squash Planet! Squish them!
- You bet!
- Bah! Your planet doesn't deserve freedom until it learns what it is to not have
  freedom. It's a lesson, I say.
- None of your beeswax, slave! You'll find out soon enough. Just focus on globing
  that mud. (shouting) Glob!
- Ambassador Moivin, you killed my lawyer.
- He defended my freedom when no-one else would. He was a good and honourable man.
- Is it possible that all this slavery and oppression is shmutzing up our freedom
  lesson?
- All eyes on Zoidberg!  Ew!
- Wait! People of Earth, listen. Yes, I'm desecrating a flag. But to preserve the
  freedom it represents!
- Ah, if only they appreciated freedom this much on my home planet. Wait a second!
  They do! Because this is my home planet.
- You're a nice man, Nixon.
- Oh, I couldn't.
- Well, maybe just a taste.  Mmm! Now that's a grand old flag!  I wonder what the
  Shroud of Turin tastes like.
- That's where I live. I have no home.
- Also Zoidberg!
- That's so beautiful!
- I've got just the thing, genuine miracle cream I bought from a travelling salesman.
  "Come one come all," he said, "Step right up!" This sounds too good to be true I
  thought. He said I looked like a smart young man. "So is it a deal?" I enquired.
  Two hours later he was gone, with 60 of my dollars. But I have the miracle cream...
- Hooray! I'm a teenage hearthrob again!
- I'm no doctor but this machine guy could use a lozenge.
- What I'm going to revrt through all my larval stages?
- Oh sure like you need all your blood.
- I can't see from down here I can't.
- The current, its too much already! Help!
- No! Zoidberg's brother is dead!  funny story. I just reverted to the age where my
  siblings budded from me and my brother Norman split off and jumped in the fountain.
- Dr Zoidberg, soaking in brine.
- Packed and ready sir.
- I only wish I could have removed the stinger.
- Bupkiss!
- One spoonful calms you down, two spoonfuls help you sleep, but three spoonfuls,
  you'll go into a sleep and never wake up! Never!
- 'I should warn you: I''m a mean drunk.'
- And he talked non-stop, like a parrot of the sea he was.
- So what's in the box already?
- In my experience boxes are usually empty. Or maybe with a little cheese stuck to
  the top. And one time pepperoni! What a day that was!  (shouting) Give me the box!
- Well don't look into it but I'm a respected internal medicine doctor! Ooo a can!
- They're all like "Stop spraying me with ink Zoidberg!" "Put on pants Zoidberg!"
  "Don't touch our fancy box Zoidberg!"
- Bah! Someday they'll watch! From down in the gutter they will, as King Zoidberg
  caresses their fancy box.
- All hail Zoidberg! The king with the box!  Now it's my turn maybe?
- I think she means you.
- Quick, into another box!
- So long your majesty!
- A fortune it is! At last, Zoidberg will live like a rich man!
- I ask for rich guy stuff and you give me shiny pebbles? Bah! I bid you adieu!
- Say, this reminds me of that time I ate that other watch Kif gave you!
- To induce vomitting, that was the solution! Everywhere it went!  What a Valentine's
  Day that was!
- Goose liver? Fish eggs?  Pah! Where's the goose? Where's the fish?
- I ate garbage yesterday and it didn't cost me $300! I'm not paying.  Farewell good
  sir!
- Ah. Thank you golf slave!  Bah! Rich pople wouldn't waste their time on this nonsense!
  Plus, these eggs are gritty and tasteless!
- What? It's not even scratch and sniff? But if rich people think it's good, I'll
  buy it!  One art please!
- So now I'm in the gutter? Surrounded by bums who eat garbage. Money brought me no
  happiness. Bupkiss!
- Welcome one and all. I finally figured out how money could make me happy! By using
  it to buy my hungry friends a feast!
- Why?
- (sadly) I can so relate to that.
- Bender, if you want to sleep in the tent tonight, you're welcome to join me and
  Hermes for a little "just friends" spooning.
- Goodnight Hubert.
- Well I have a lot of experience telling patients bad news so, let me break it to
  him gently.  (shouting) Fry you have no nose! Your nose is gone! You have no nose
  on your face! Where it is I can't say but on your face it's not!
- Cheer up friend. When we get home a high quality prosthesis will have you looking
  good as new.
- No I'm good.
- Welcome to my life!
- (shouting) Go!
- I saw a frilly cake in here you would remember all your life. I know I will. Late
  at night it haunts me with it's frosted beauty. (shouting) Order the cake dammit!
- Impassively.
- I came as soon as I could.  It appears to be a case of African Hydraulic Fever!
- Gross.
- So I guess everything worked out fine.
- Look who's here everyone! It's Zoidberg, the lovable tramp!
- Performing? What? Please, if someone could spare me money to buy shoes -
- Quiet robot, Bender's on TV.
- That was uncanny.
- I'm networking. Let me give you my card.
- So do you guys know about anything else going on, because I'm totally still ready
  to party.
- (singing) Don't wanna talk about anything else...
- Only $14.99 for a two-record set. Two records! Oh Zoidberg, at last you're becoming
  a crafty consumer!  Hello? I'll take eight!
- I watch TV with that guy!
- (singing) I can't believe everyone is just ad-libbing!
- (shouting) Yes you can. The beauty was in your heart, not your hands.  The music's
  bad and you should feel bad.
- I'll take eight!
ZOOKEEPER:
- Sorry I'm late, long story. Now everybody hit the deck! I'm cutting the entire line
  and stealing the exhibit.
- Ah, superheroes! Or should I say superzeroes!
- Animals, attack.
- Nice job Fingers!
- Later, if anyone asks how I got away, tell them right now!
- Fool! A quip without putting me behind bars would have been far more delicious!
  Here catch!
- Of course not. You think I'd show you my lair? My lair's a million times nicer than
  this!
- Hawk! Fetch!
- Our transaction is complete. Come Solomon, to the lair.
